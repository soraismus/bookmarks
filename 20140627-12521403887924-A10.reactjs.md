React.js vs traditional MVC (Backbone, Angular)
===============================================

2014-04-14

I've been working with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) for the
last two weeks, and I think it's quite a revolutionary library. In this
blog, I will tell you why.

If you don't know what React is, visit the doc and read up on it. The
basic idea is this:

Since DOM manipulations are slow, React replicates the DOM virtually.
Your application talks to the virtual DOM that is very fast, and then
React diffs the virtual DOM with the real DOM and applies all changes
efficiently.

In case you wonder how this fits into todays MVC landscape, let me quote
the react guys: *"Many people choose to think of React as the V in
MVC."*

I personally think that this is a conservative statement that should
appeal to people who don't like to try new things so much. If I
interpret the statement correctly, they themselves don't think that way.

React's way of doing things is a lot more than "the V in MVC". React's
fast, virtual DOM lets you do things that were so out of the question
before, most people will not be able to fully grasp the big advantage of
it for a while.

A real-life scenario
--------------------

At my company, we developed a SPA called
[concat](http://bluevalor.net/concat/). One part of this app is a list
of 5000 companies and their stock returns.

you can filter this list by

-   country
-   industry
-   text search
-   whether they had news over a given time period

other features are:

-   custom favorite lists per user
-   a date range selector
-   the filters contain summary stats. For example you see how many
    companies you have in the list for each country with your current
    filter-setting.

The app was implemented in [chaplin](http://chaplinjs.org/) which is a
framework based on Backbone. The problem with this list-widget is that
whenever a user triggers a filter, a lot of views need to be re-rendered
because of the summary stats on the different filters. This needs a lot
of controller code.

Now there are tools available to implement this in a sane way. With
Backbone you would do the talking between the different parts via
events, favorably with a controller receiving all the user inputs,
manipulating the models if needed and then calling the views and tell
them to re-render if necessary.

There are other frameworks that provide simpler ways of doing this
(2-way data binding), usually at the cost of flexibility.

The question is: Is there generally a better way? Or let's rephrase the
question: What would be the best way?

How about this: *"When a user interaction occurs on the stock-list,
re-render everything"*

This is the intuitive thing to do. Im sure this is what naive,
inexperienced devs would try first. It's the simplest and therefore
easiest approach. However, everybody knows this won't work due to render
performance. With React, this suddenly becomes a viable design pattern.

Think about what this means for a while. You can rerender everything all
the time. This means that half of the work - the more complicated half -
will simply vanish, because you don't need to develop something that
orchestrates the partial rendering and handles all the side-effects
carefully.

Let me quote myself from before:

*The problem with this list-widget is that whenever a user triggers a
filter, a lot of views need to be rerendered because of the summary
stats on the different filters.*

With React, the problem is:

*The problem with this list-widget is that whenever a user triggers a
filter, I re-render everything because of the summary stats on the
different filters.*

This sounds a lot easier doesn't it? Now different frameworks provide
similar simplifying solutions for some specific scenarios. But React
provides them ubiquitously. The virtual DOM is always there.

I have rewritten the stock-list in React, and I have been blown away.
Things become so much easier to build and understand. Things tend to
simply go away:

-   Backbone Events: I have yet to see a case where I would need them.
    (I'm sure there are some)
-   Backbone Models/Collections? Plain objects are enough.
-   Memory leaks because of non-disposal of Views? Gone.
-   My complex controllers are nicely split up.
-   Except for ajax stuff, I didn't need jQuery so far.
-   My application state is minimized (!!!).
-   My code is clean, organized and extensible without any major
    refactoring.
-   It took me less discipline to not make a mess (global
    publish/subscribe à la Backbone.Events is almost as evil as global
    variables)

Also, I have never felt "restrained" by React. It doesn't trade
simplicity/robustness for flexibility like most frameworks out there.

You need to fully embrace the possibilities of React though. I've seen
some posts where people just switch Backbone Views with React. This can
make sense in a transition/try-out phase. But if you start a new
project, I suggest to throw everything out of the window first and try
to fully embrace React. I think not much else (except a Router) is
needed besides React to build a complex and fast SPA with a clean,
simple and maintainable codebase (Obviously there are exceptions to
this).

Your code will not contain the usual MV\* patterns. Don't be scared of
that. Code will be organized. Concerns will be separated. And so far, I
feel like the React way is superior to MV\* for a lot of use cases. You
could *easily* marry the two if push comes to shove, but: It's likely
you'd want to do this because MV\* is familiar, not because it improves
your codebase objectively.

There is one thing that sucks a little with React.js: Talking to the
virtual DOM differs from talking to the real one
([JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html),
[coffeescript
craziness](http://blog.vjeux.com/2013/javascript/react-coffeescript.html)).
But it's a trade-off that I'm willing to accept in a heartbeat.

If you'd like to know how React works in practice, look at [this little
tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html),
it taught me the most out of everything I've read.

One thing is for sure: React does things so differently, you can not
judge it from a distance. You need to try it extensively in real-life to
figure out if it works for you.
