How would you like to get $2,000 in free money today, fresh off the
government printing presses? And what if I told you it wouldn’t just be
a nice windfall for you and your friends and family, but that we’d do it
for all Americans on an ongoing basis, and that doing so would solve our
crippling problem of mass unemployment?

I know what you’re thinking: it would be crazy. Either it would be a
fast track to crippling inflation or it’s some Republican satire of an
ultra-liberal government handout program. But it is not quite as radical
as it sounds. The key idea behind such a program has a longstanding,
bipartisan economic pedigree. John Stuart Mill argued in 1829 that mass
unemployment was caused by “a deficiency of the circulating medium”
relative to other commodities. John Maynard Keynes used the idea in his
1936 book, *The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money*, to
lampoon the inherent silliness of gold mining, suggesting that old coal
mines could be filled up with bottles full of banknotes, buried over
with trash, then left “to private enterprise on well-tried principles of
laissez-faire to dig the notes up again.” Milton Friedman suggested that
monetary policy could never fail to cure mass unemployment, because as a
last resort the central bank could just drop cash out of helicopters—an
enticing analogy that former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke
borrowed in a 2002 speech, earning himself the persistent nickname of
“Helicopter Ben.”

And it hasn’t just been theorizing. In 2008, George W. Bush and Nancy
Pelosi engineered the tax rebate stimulus, in which everyone received a
check in the mail—paid for, eventually, with fresh new money. Studies
have found that this stimulus worked quite well; it was just overwhelmed
by the Great Recession, and we only received checks once. Mill, Keynes,
Friedman, and even Bernanke might argue that we should revive a similar
stimulus again—only this time, on a much bigger scale, and on an ongoing
basis.

Why? Because the economy has evolved to a point where it is vulnerable
to mild depressions. In fact, the one we’re in now could persist for
decades, as similar conditions have in Japan and other countries. In
order to avoid that slow, painful outcome, we need a policy that will
jump-start our economy. After three straight years of political gridlock
it’s clear that Congress is not going to provide the fiscal stimulus we
need, and while the tools the Federal Reserve has at its disposal have
helped, they’ve not done enough. If Congress could be persuaded to give
the Fed a new tool, one that would let it distribute purchasing power to
the broad mass of the population—to “drop money from helicopters,” so to
speak—it might be enough to help us escape the nightmare of slow growth
and persistent unemployment we’re in now.

The key economic idea undergirding this policy idea is something called
aggregate demand, which, stated simply, is the total amount of spending
in the economy. During a financial crisis, aggregate demand goes down,
since newly unemployed workers have less money and people who manage to
keep their jobs reduce their spending out of fear. When people spend
less money, sales fall, and businesses are forced to lay off workers,
who then spend even less money, and so on. In other words, money goes in
circles: my spending is your income, and your spending is my income. If
we all simultaneously cut back on our spending—if aggregate demand
declines—then everybody’s income declines, too. That is, very crudely,
what happened during the Great Depression, when there were millions of
perfectly able workers desperate for jobs, while perfectly functional
factories lay idle due to lack of customers. It’s also what has been
happening, to a milder degree, in our economy since the 2008 crisis.

While depression economics has many strange features, the most important
one to remember is this: with slack in the economy, it’s possible to
have an economic free lunch. If our economy were running at capacity,
new government spending, for example, would tend to create inflation
because the capacity (workers, raw materials, and equipment) would have
to be bid away from someone else, thereby raising prices. But during a
depression that doesn’t happen. Instead, new spending brings idle
capacity into production. To put that another way, the
single-most-important underpinning of a functioning economy is to ensure
that there is sufficient aggregate demand.

In order to do that, economists have relied for the past seventy years
or so on two basic tools: fiscal policy and monetary policy. The first
concerns how the government taxes and spends; the second concerns the
action of the central bank (in America, that’s the Federal Reserve),
which controls the supply of money. While both tools are complex, the
main thing to understand is that they both have an accelerator and a
brake pedal. If the economy is overheating, with spending overtaking new
production of goods and services, resulting in a bidding spiral and
increasing inflation, we can hit the brakes. If the economy is moving
too slowly, with spending not keeping pace with the production of goods
and services, we can hit the gas.

For fiscal policy, increased government spending or decreased taxation
is our accelerator; the opposite, austerity, is the brake. These work to
add or subtract the amount of spending in the economy. For monetary
policy, the federal funds rate can act as either an accelerator or a
brake. U.S. banks are required to hold reserves at the Fed, which pays
interest on them, similar to a normal checking account. For a bank to
loan money to a real person, they must find someone willing to pay an
interest rate above the Fed’s rate. So if the Fed jacks up the interest
rate, it discourages lending, as banks are paid better to park their
money at the Fed. Lowering the Fed rate does the opposite. The use of
these tools is commonly expressed as a trade-off between unemployment
and inflation. Try to push unemployment too low, and inflation will
speed up as companies bid for scarce labor, pushing up wages and sending
spending surging through the economy. Conversely, allow unemployment to
get too high, and a collapse in spending can cause a collapse of prices,
which will lead to more unemployment, which will lead to less spending,
and so on.

In the decades since the Great Depression, we’ve managed to avoid
another economic catastrophe of that magnitude by using these two tools
to prop up aggregate demand. So why can’t we just use them again to
boost us out of the slump in which we find ourselves now? The answer has
to do with the inequality that has steadily increased in our society
since the 1980s.

Way back during the post-World War II era, the economy was booming.
Unemployment was very low, productivity was up, and workers’ wages were
growing steadily in real terms—that is, even after adjusting for
inflation. Along with the cost-of-living adjustments written into many
job contracts, that meant wage-price inflationary spirals were always on
the horizon. As a result, for about thirty years, from the mid-1940s
through the ’70s, the main problem for economic policymakers was not
growth or unemployment, it was simply keeping inflation in check. Since
it’s very hard to cut wages, the Fed did that by repeatedly inducing
small recessions. The idea was to create enough unemployment to slow
both aggregate wage growth and the ensuing spending. Despite the
often-uncomfortable abruptness with which the economy bounced from
recession to rapid growth, this was still the greatest economic boom in
American history.

But it didn’t last. As the ’70s transitioned into the ’80s, several
structural developments in the larger economy caused a qualitative shift
in how monetary policy worked. First, more and more people got access to
credit, in the form of credit cards and home equity loans. This boom in
consumer credit meant not only that households had new purchasing power
but that a substantial chunk of spending was happening through a
channel—borrowing—that was sensitive to the Fed’s interest rate
mechanism. If inflation was getting out of hand, the Fed could simply
tinker with interest rates and, suddenly, a huge chunk of the economy,
including consumer spending, would respond in kind. For the central
banker, this was something of a revelation: it was no longer necessary
to provoke recessions—a messy, blunt instrument—in order to restrain
inflation.

This period was called the “Great Moderation.” While real GDP growth was
substantially slower than during the thirty-year postwar boom, there
were fewer sharp booms and recessions, mostly because the Fed no longer
induced recessions deliberately. But there were a few more features of
this new, more moderate economy that policy elites didn’t fully
appreciate right away. The first was that income inequality began to
take off. Starting in the ’80s, productivity gains were no longer shared
with workers. Therefore, the wage share of the economy began to
decrease. As a percentage of total output, wages have fallen from a high
of almost 52 percent around 1970 to less than 43 percent today (see
Graph 1). Meanwhile, inequality within wages also increased. The upshot?
The rich began capturing nearly all the results of economic growth—the
top 1 percent’s share of national income increased from about 8 percent
in the mid-’70s to about 23 percent today.

**Graph 1: Wage share of GDP, 1947-present**\

And that turned out to have some awful side effects, since the rich
disproportionately save their money rather than spend it. But they don’t
save by piling up huge pyramids of cash like Scrooge McDuck, they “save”
by buying financial assets—which means that most of the fruits of
economic growth have been channeled into asset price increases, rather
than consumer price inflation. That partly explains the tendency toward
bubbles. All of the recessions since the start of the Great Moderation
were caused by collapsing asset bubbles: the savings-and-loan crisis of
the late ’80s, the dot-com stock bubble in the 2000s, and the housing
bubble in 2007. But that’s not the worst of it. After the early ’80s,
the Fed’s interest rate tool seemed to become progressively less
effective. While it was working, they had to keep turning the Fed funds
rate down and down and down again (see Graph 2).

**Graph 2: Effective federal funds rate, 1979-present**\
 ![image](http://wamo.s3.amazonaws.com/mag/1403/1403-cooper_chart-2.jpg)

What was going on here? In a modern economy, consumer spending accounts
for the vast majority of economic output. But with median incomes
growing slowly, if at all, ever-increasing household debt was necessary
to sustain aggregate demand. As household debt mounted, the Fed had to
keep lowering interest rates to induce greater and greater borrowing
(see Graph 3). In theory, that’s not much of a problem—so long as you
can keep dialing down interest rates. But here’s the thing: you can’t.

**Graph 3: Household debt as a fraction of GDP**\

The final nail in the coffin of the Great Moderation is what’s known as
the zero lower bound, which means that the Fed funds rate cannot be
pushed below zero (since, if there were negative interest rates, people
would just hoard cash). In other words, the Fed’s interest rate
accelerator has a maximum setting. And, it turns out, pushing the pedal
all the way to the floor isn’t always enough to keep the economy going.

Take the early 2000s, for example. During the recession caused by the
collapse of the dot-com bubble, the Fed lowered rates almost to zero,
yet the stimulative effect was strikingly weak. Aside from today’s
economy, the 2000s expansion was by far the weakest in postwar history,
despite being driven by a housing bubble of world-historical proportions
and enormous deficit spending. Then came the financial crisis in late
2007 and early 2008. When the economy fell into recession, the Fed
started to lower rates sharply and reached near zero by late 2008. (For
complicated reasons, the Fed refuses to go all the way to zero.) This
action, coupled with the sizable fiscal stimulus of 2009, was enough to
stave off a full-blown depression, but it was not enough to prevent mass
unemployment, which spiked to over 10 percent and, more importantly, has
come down at an agonizing pace. The prime working-age employment rate
collapsed during the crisis, and has barely budged since (see Graph 4).

This is why income inequality is dangerous: it is a drag on aggregate
demand. As inequality increases, as it has in the U.S., the drag grows
commensurately. Stagnant wages mean that consumer borrowing must be
steadily increased to keep the economy moving forward. Meanwhile, the
fruits of growth flowing to the top mean a vast pile-up in savings and
associated asset bubbles, and the recessions that follow are harder and
harder to recover from. In other words, keeping an economy that suffers
from galloping economic inequality pressurized and growing requires an
economic policy regime that contains the seeds of its own destruction.
And this leads us to where we are now: consumers today can’t stomach any
more debt, interest rates have hit the floor, and a grinding, low-level
depression is upon us. Welcome to 2014.

So what should we do? After aggressively stabilizing the financial
sector, the Fed has been cautious about new policies, but it has tried
two new strategies to restore employment: forward guidance and
quantitative easing.

Forward guidance consists of trying to reassure the markets that the Fed
funds rate will stay low for a long time after full employment is
reached, thereby calming fears that the Fed will step on the brakes the
moment employment returns to normal levels. Quantitative easing is when
the Fed uses newly printed money to purchase Treasury bonds and other
financial assets, with the idea of pushing down longer-term interest
rates and forcing money out into the economy. Economists and financial
wonks can (and do) discuss the relative merits of these policies all
day, but the one thing that almost everyone agrees on is that while they
helped us avoid a full-blown depression, they did not restore full
employment—or anything even close to it. Since the crisis, both output
and employment growth has been weak.

Therefore, economists have been discussing the possibility of using more
drastic tools. There are four major options under discussion.

The first is to push interest rates below zero. The idea here is fairly
simple. If the problem with our economy is framed in terms of people
trying to save too much relative to their spending, then negative
interest rates would make saving money expensive. If you kept cash in a
savings account with a negative interest rate, you would actually lose
money. There are a few major problems with this idea, one of which is
cultural. We Americans consider saving virtuous; a Fed policy that
punished savers would simply not go over well. Another problem is that
if interest rates on money were sharply negative, investors might just
pour their money into commodities like wheat, oil, or copper as a store
of value, which would keep those raw materials from socially positive
uses and be tough to regulate. Yet another problem, which the economist
Miles Kimball (an advocate of this idea) points out, is that if we
really wanted to make this work, *all* money would have to be subject to
interest rate fluctuations, which means we’d have to get rid of paper
money. (If everything were electronic, there would be nowhere for savers
to hide.)

The second major policy option, championed by International Monetary
Fund economist Olivier Blanchard, is functionally very similar to the
negative interest rate proposal, although it’s a little sneakier. Right
now, the Fed targets inflation of 2 percent. Raising the target to 4 or
5 percent (assuming it could be achieved) would discourage savings and
promote spending in the same way that negative interest rates would, but
without the probable outrage at having money subtracted from one’s bank
account.

The third policy option is known as nominal gross domestic product
targeting, the major proponent of which is the economist Scott Sumner.
The idea is all about self-fulfilling expectations. Recall that the
central bank owns the printing press, so it can create arbitrary
quantities of dollars. By making a pre-commitment to keep the economy on
a particular spending trajectory, self-fulfilling collapses in spending
would not happen. Something similar to this policy seems to have kept
Australia and Israel out of the Great Recession. But in order to sustain
such a policy, the Fed might have to intervene in the economy quite
frequently, and then the distributional consequences could be serious.
Quantitative easing, for example, helps push up asset prices (the stock
market has regained all the ground lost since 2009 and then some), which
disproportionately benefits the wealthy.

The fourth and final policy proposal on the table is what I’ll call the
“helicopter money” option. It too is fairly simple. Under such a policy
(which could be combined with aspects of the first three), every U.S.
citizen would receive a regular payment, in the form of, say, a check
from the Internal Revenue Service. The amount of each check would change
depending on the health of the economy, but it could be fairly
substantial during times of economic slack. To jar us out of our current
slump, for instance, I’d start with payments on the order of $2,000 per
person. These checks would arrive on an as-needed basis, depending on
the state of the economy.

Again, that may sound crazy. But the idea is to address the lack of
aggregate demand in the economy in the simplest, most mechanical
fashion: if the economy needs more aggregate demand, you give people
money to spend, since when people (especially non-rich ones) have more
money, they spend more money, and therefore aggregate demand increases.
People who don’t spend the money outright might choose instead to pay
down debt, leaving them more willing to use credit for future spending,
and people who worry that the policy will create inflation will move
their money from cash and savings to spending on durable goods. (And,
remember, the policy won’t create excessive inflation so long as there
is slack in aggregate demand.)

The Fed would then “pay” for it by creating new money. That new money,
by the way, would be added to the monetary base, not the deficit. While
this concept gets into arcane government accounting conventions very
quickly, the point is that the Fed has the power to create infinite
cash. Indeed, such mass money creation is hardly new: the quantitative
easing program has already been carried out in a similar way—with
trillions of dollars in new money.

At any rate, the only thing standing in the way of the helicopter money
plan is the way the Fed’s charter is written. Namely, it’s illegal: the
Fed does not currently have the power to hand out checks to the American
people; Congress has to do that. But laws can be changed.

On the straight economics, this solution is nearly identical to the 2008
Bush/Pelosi stimulus. In that case, Congress sent money to everyone and
paid for it by issuing debt. Later, the Fed bought more than that
amount’s worth of Treasury bonds. (In this case, we would simply avoid
that two-step process: Congress would hand over the reins directly to
the Fed.) This similarity leads many economists to be skeptical of the
helicopter solution as redundant. “I’m all for fiscal and monetary
stimulus,” Paul Krugman told me in late January. “But I don’t see
helicopter money as adding anything substantive to the menu of policy
tools, or as making the politics any easier.”

Krugman is right that helicopter money isn’t fundamentally innovative
economically. The argument here, however, is not economic; it’s
institutional. Instead of Congress being in charge of distributing
resources according to its erratic whims and halting ability to
compromise, the Fed would do it. The Fed would watch aggregate demand
closely (indeed, it already does this) and make quick, proactive
decisions on whether to send everyone money, and how much, without
having to wait for Congress to deliberate over a stimulus bill.

Right now, Congress has the power to directly spend its way to full
employment, but it’s not doing it. And neither are the state
governments. In fact, since 2010, Congress and most of the states have
been doing the exact opposite, sharply reducing spending. After the
Great Depression, it took World War II to break the political deadlock
and get Congress to dump money into the economy, but today, nothing
similarly jarring is in sight. If the Fed took over, it would respond
directly to the needs of the economy, without getting bogged down in
endless politically charged debates about the virtues of austerity or
the moral peril of government checks (recall how Senate “moderates”
forced the Obama stimulus to be too small). Instead, it could respond,
quickly and efficiently, to fluctuations in aggregate demand.

Handing the reins to the Fed is a good idea for another reason: it would
give the Fed a policy tool that shares the fine-tuning properties of the
interest rate mechanism, but without the constraint of the zero lower
bound and the tendency to create skyrocketing household debt. When the
economy is running hot, threatening inflation, the Fed could slow
deposits to a trickle (or raise rates), but when recession strikes, it
could speed them back up again, quickly and easily. After all, in order
for macroeconomic stabilization policy to work, it must be adjusted
frequently and quickly—especially in the computer age, when recessions
can gather force with astonishing speed.

What’s more, there is no reason to think that our aggregate demand
problem will be cured without some kind of aggressive change. The
economist Brad DeLong has calculated that reasonable estimates of the
current and future damage to our economy from the present crisis are
greater than those from the Great Depression. “Unless something—and it
will need to be something major—returns the U.S. to its pre-2008 growth
trajectory, future economic historians will not regard the Great
Depression as the worst business-cycle disaster of the industrial age,”
he wrote in the journal *Project Syndicate*. “It is we who are living in
their worst case.” Already our current weak economic expansion is near
the length of the postwar average, and a new recession may strike at any
time, which would erase the pitiful gains of the past five years. (God
only knows what is cooking in the dungeons of Wall Street.) If we change
nothing, we could be stuck in our current situation for decades. Japan
has been mired in a similar trap for almost thirty years.

Why hasn’t the helicopter money option already been enacted? The main
reason is simply that until very recently we thought we had cured
chronic shortages of aggregate demand, so no one was really thinking
about these issues. The other reason is that Congress has not yet gotten
it together to pass a law allowing the Fed to cut checks to the American
people.

But there’s no reason why they shouldn’t. Democrats should be for it
because it is straight-up economic stimulus, writ large. And Republicans
should be for it because it is the stimulus option that’s most in line
with conservative values. To be sure, a whole lot of right-wing
conservatives will object to the very notion—government checks give them
the willies. And for conservatives with the strongest tendencies toward
gold buggery, who are already freaked out that the Fed’s quantitative
easing is debasing the currency and setting us up for hyperinflation,
the idea will never be in favor. But what conservatives really objected
to about the Obama stimulus and all subsequent Democratic proposals for
fiscal pump priming was not so much the fiscal consequences, despite
what they said—after all, they favored the Iraq War and the Bush tax
cuts, which drove up the debt, and voted for Paul Ryan’s budget, which
would have done the same. What really infuriates them about Democratic
stimulus measures is that it is spending by government, meant to achieve
government priorities, and delivered through government channels in ways
that enhance the reach and influence of the government.

The helicopter money policy, by contrast, keeps government almost
completely out of the picture. It distributes resources directly to
citizens, with no limits on how they can spend it, thereby strengthening
individual choice and the private sector, not government bureaucracies.
It’s a stimulus Milton Friedman could love. And if everyone gets the
same-sized check, there’s not even a concession to the god of
progressivity—it’s like a flat tax in reverse! There will be a
Republican president again someday, and as we’ve seen, it is highly
likely that government will face the same weak growth and high
unemployment we face today. This is a tool as friendly to the
conservatives’ ideology as they are likely to find.

In any case, we shouldn’t forget the relative simplicity of what’s wrong
with our economy right now: it’s a simple divergence between incentives
for production and those for consumption. The money supply is a very
powerful tool to fix that misalignment of incentives, and its power is
*communal*. It comes from the fact that it is accepted as a medium of
exchange by all 310 million Americans. We should not fear to use that
tool, and to provide badly needed help to millions of people in the
process.
