Exercise Is ADHD Medication
===========================

Physical movement improves mental focus, memory, and cognitive
flexibility; new research shows just how critical it is to academic
performance.

 (Hillman et al, *Pediatrics*/*The Atlantic*)

Mental exercises to build (or
rebuild)[](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/how-to-rebuild-an-attention-span/279326/)attention
span have shown promise recently as adjuncts or alternatives to
amphetamines in addressing symptoms common to Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Building cognitive control, to be better
able to focus on just one thing, or
[single-task](http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/373027/singletasking-is-the-new-multitasking/),
might involve regular practice with a specialized video game that
reinforces "top-down" cognitive modulation, as was the case in a popular
[paper](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/how-to-rebuild-an-attention-span/279326/?single_page=true)
in *Nature* last year. Cool but still notional. More insipid but also
more clearly critical to addressing what's being called the ADHD
[epidemic](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/magazine/the-not-so-hidden-cause-behind-the-adhd-epidemic.html?pagewanted=all)
is plain old physical activity.

This morning the medical journal *Pediatrics*
[published](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/) research that found
kids who took part in a regular physical activity program showed
important enhancement of cognitive performance and brain function. The
findings, according to University of Illinois professor Charles Hillman
and colleagues, "demonstrate a causal effect of a physical program on
executive control, and provide support for physical activity for
improving childhood cognition and brain health." If it seems odd that
this is something that still needs support, that's because it is odd,
yes. Physical activity is clearly a high, high-yield investment for all
kids, but especially those attentive or hyperactive. This brand of
research is still published and written about as though it were a novel
finding, in part because exercise programs for kids remain underfunded
and underprioritized in many school curricula, even though exercise is
clearly integral to maximizing the utility of time spent in class.

The improvements in this case came in executive control, which consists
of inhibition (resisting distraction, maintaining focus), working
memory, and cognitive flexibility (switching between tasks). The images
above show the brain activity in the group of kids who did the program
as opposed to the group that didn't. It's the kind of difference that's
so dramatic it's a little unsettling. The study only lasted nine months,
but when you're only seven years old, nine months is a long time to be
sitting in class with a blue head.

It may potentially be advisable to consider possibly implementing more
exercise opportunities for kids.

Earlier this month, another
[study](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10802-014-9929-y)
found that a 12-week exercise program improved math and reading test
scores in all kids, but especially in those with signs of ADHD.
(Executive functioning is impaired in ADHD, and tied to performance in
math and reading.) Lead researcher Alan Smith, chair of the department
of kinesiology at Michigan State, went out on no limb at all in a press
statement at the time, saying, "Early studies suggest that physical
activity can have a positive effect on children who suffer from ADHD."

Last year a very similar
[study](http://jad.sagepub.com/content/17/1/70.refs?patientinform-links=yes&legid=spjad;17/1/70)
in the *Journal of Attention Disorders* found that just 26 minutes of
daily physical activity for eight weeks significantly allayed ADHD
symptoms in grade-school kids. The modest conclusion of the study was
that "physical activity shows promise for addressing ADHD symptoms in
young children." The researchers went on to write that this finding
should be "carefully explored with further studies."

"If physical activity is established as an effective intervention for
ADHD," they continued, "it will also be important to address possible
complementary effects of physical activity and existing treatment
strategies ..." Which is a kind of phenomenal degree of reservation
compared to the haste with which millions of kids have been introduced
to amphetamines and other stimulants to address said ADHD. The number of
prescriptions increased from 34.8 to 48.4 million between 2007 and 2011
alone. The pharmaceutical market around the disorder has grown to
several billion dollars in recent years while school exercise
initiatives have enjoyed no such spoils of entrepreneurialism. But, you
know, once there is more research, it may potentially be advisable to
consider possibly implementing more exercise opportunities for kids.

in the Illinois after-school physical activity program\
 (L. Brian Stauffer)

Over all, the pandemic of physical inactivity, as Hillman and colleagues
put it in their *Pediatrics* journal article today, is "a serious threat
to global health" responsible for around 10 percent of premature deaths
from noncommincable diseases. But it clearly manifests in ways more
subtle than deaths, including scholastic performance, which we're
continuously learning. I talked last week with Paul Nystedt, an
associate professor of economics and finance at Jönköping University in
Sweden, who just published a multi-country
[study](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13524-014-0325-6)
that found that obese teenagers go on to earn 18 percent less money as
adults than their peers, even if they are no longer obese. He believes
that's most likely because of the adversity that obese kids experience
from classmates and teachers, which leads to both cognitive and
noncognitive disparities between obese and non-obese kids. Because obese
children are more likely to come from low-income homes to begin with,
that only perpetuates wealth gaps and stifles mobility. Nystedt and his
coauthors conclude, "The rapid increase in childhood and adolescent
obesity could have long-lasting effects on the economic growth and
productivity of nations."

John Ratey, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard,
[suggests](http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/3142.html)that people
think of exercise as medication for ADHD. Even very light physical
activity improves mood and cognitive performance by triggering the brain
to release dopamine and serotonin, similar to the way that stimulant
medications like Adderall do. In a 2012 [TED
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBSVZdTQmDs), Ratey argued that
physical exercise "is really for our brains." He likened it to taking "a
little bit of Prozac and a little bit of Ritalin." As a rule, I say
never trust anyone who has given a TED talk. But maybe in this case
that's a constructive way to think about moving one's body. But not the
inverse, where taking Ritalin counts as exercise.
