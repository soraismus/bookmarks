Google’s Schmidt Says Inequality Will Be Number One Issue For Democracies

#### Modders Get Samsung’s Exclusive Music Service Running On Non-Samsung Devices Within Hours Of Launch

![image](http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/ericschmidt008-1.jpg?w=306)

Google’s Eric Schmidt told a SXSW audience in Austin today that Google
is “very, very worried about” [the growing financial inequality and
subsequent protests in San
Francisco](http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/10/tech-industry-activists-talk-past-each-other-at-the-crunchies/).
“The average person there has benefited from the automation, the
globalization, the technology,” he said, and predicted that inequality
will become “the No. 1 issue of democracies.”

Schmidt was promoting his book, [*The New Digital
Age*](http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Digital-Age-Reshaping/dp/0307957136),
with his co-author, Jared Cohen, in a wide-ranging interview on privacy,
government, and the social impacts of technology.

Google has been embroiled in the unrest of growing financial inequality,
with San Francisco activists targeting the company’s private charter
buses as a symbol of the social divide. A few economists we spoke to
believe that the tech industry’s presence in San Francisco has generally
buffered the city’s middle class [from the ravages of
recession](http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/15/is-tech-money-good-for-san-franciscos-middle-class-an-economists-perspective/),
but skyrocketing rents have forced out many long-time residents.

Technology can help some, but inequality is growing. ”The US labor
market, and many others in Europe and elsewhere, have experienced
sharply increasing inequality. Though other factors also do play a role,
technological change is the most important driver of this explosion in
inequality,” MIT Professor Daron Acemoğlu writes to me, echoing a common
theme among labor economists.

Schmidt proposed three solutions. First, support startups. “When you
look at the solutions to the problems that you’re describing, which
ultimately lead to severe joblessness, they all involve creating
fast-growth startups.”

Second is “more education, more information, more connectivity.” He and
President Obama have both pushed for more education in science,
technology, engineering, and math to help fill [unmet
demand](http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/22/teachers-from-facebook-and-salesforce-fill-udacitys-new-data-science-program/)
for tech jobs. Schmidt predicts that jobs that are not related to
“creativity and caring” will ultimately be eliminated by robots who can
automate “repetitive” tasks — even knowledge workers, such as some
reporters.

Finally, there are upper limits to the number of people who can hold
advanced STEM jobs. Those who lose out will need government assistance.
Schmidt argued that society needs a “safety net” for those who lose
their jobs so they can “at least live somewhere and have healthcare.”

Either way, change is coming. “The longer term solution is to recognize
that you can’t hold back technology progress.”
