Basic JavaScript: Prototypical Inheritance vs. Functional Inheritance
---------------------------------------------------------------------

March 22nd, 2013

Inheritance in JavaScript has been the topic of many discussions in the
past and will continue to be the source of future debates and arguments.
While we do value [composition over
inheritance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance),
we don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater either. So, from
time to time, we run into these cases where we want some notion of
inheritance in JavaScript. Now what?

As with many things in JavaScript, there is not a single straight
answer. We can choose between a couple of options and many different
variations of these solutions. But one thing’s for sure: we can’t have
it all!

In this blog post I want to discuss two different styles of inheritance
that I have a hard time choosing from when programming JavaScript. And
as with everything in life, both styles have their own pros and cons.

#### Prototypical inheritance

In ‘classical’ programming languages, one class can directly inherit
from another class. JavaScript doesn’t have this notion of classes
(yet). Instead, JavaScript has prototypes which you can augment to fit
your own needs. This means that having a single augmented object as the
prototype for other objects, which *‘inherit’* all members of the
augmented prototype object, kind of simulates a *pseudo-classical*
*inheritance* pattern. Let’s talk code in order to demystify this
concept.

~~~~ {.csharpcode style="height: 559px; width: 100%"}
// validator.js
var Validator = exports.Validator = function() {
    this._rules = [];
};

Validator.prototype.addRule = function(rule) {
    this._rules.push(rule)
};

Validator.prototype.validate = function(instance) {
    ...
};

// specificValidator.js
var util = require('util');

var SpecificValidator = function() {
    Validator.call(this);
};

util.inherits(SpecificValidator, Validator);

SpecificValidator.prototype.filter = function(instance) {
    ...
};

// client.js
var validator = new SpecificValidator();

// Calls function on derived object
validator.filter( { ... } );        

// Calls function on base object
validator.validate( { ... } );        
~~~~

Here we have a constructor function named *Validator* which is the base
object for other *‘derived’* objects. We augment the prototype with two
functions (*addRule* and *validate*). Next we define another constructor
function named *SpecificValidator*. We *‘derive’* this new constructor
function by calling the base constructor function and wiring the
prototype by using the
[util.inherits()](http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inherits_constructor_superconstructor)
function from the Node.js core library.

We have to use the *new* keyword in order to instantiate a
*SpecificValidator* object. Now we can use the functions that we added
to the prototype.

#### Functional inheritance

This pattern is advocated by [Douglas
Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/) in his book [JavaScript, The Good
Parts](http://elegantcode.com/2010/05/24/book-review-javascript-the-good-parts/).
There he offers this particular style as the way to go for inheriting
objects. Let’s look at an example.

~~~~ {.csharpcode style="height: 585px; width: 100%"}
// validator.js
module.exports = function() {
    var rules = [], my = {};

    my.addRule = function(rule) {
        rules.push(rule);
    };

    my.validate = function(instance) {
        ...
    };

    return my;
};

// specificValidator.js
var validator = require('...').validator;

var specificValidator = function() {
    var my = validator();

    my.filter = function(instance) {
        ...
    };
    
    return my;
};

// client.js
var validator = specificValidator();

// Calls function on derived object
validator.filter( { ... } );    

// Calls function on base object
validator.validate( { ... } );        
~~~~

The base constructor function returns an object that is augmented with
functions and is returned at the end. The derived constructor function
simple calls the base constructor function and further augments the
retrieved object before returning it to the calling code. Here we don’t
have to use the new keyword to instantiate anything. Just calling the
right constructor function gives us an object which we can use in our
client code.

#### Conclusion

The most important benefit of prototypical inheritance, at least in my
humble opinion, is performance. By augmenting the prototype with
functions, we only create these functions once. Not matter how many
times we instantiate a constructor function, the same functions get
(re)used every single time. Functional inheritance on the other hand
creates new functions every time a constructor function is called, which
is several orders of magnitude slower compared to the prototypical
inheritance pattern.

On the other hand, the prototypical approach doesn’t come with
encapsulation. Looking at the example shown earlier, the ‘\_rules’
property is publicly available to the client code and can be manipulated
at will. By using a simple convention, like prefixing with an
underscore, we can indicate that these private members should not be
touched in order to guarantee a correct behavior. But again, nothing can
be enforced. Using functional constructors, we can have private
variables and functions that cannot be manipulated by the calling code.

There are more pros and cons, but for me, these are the most important
ones to be aware of. You can see that both styles have their strengths
and weaknesses. I usually tend to go with prototypical inheritance as
this is the ‘JavaScript way’, but I like using the functional approach
as well for those cases were I know in advance that not too many objects
are created or when I don’t care about performance.

I would love to hear other takes on this. What particular styles do you
use? When do you use them and why?

Until next time

    The prototype based inheritance gives you a lot more perf wins than
    just only creating the functions once. Modern JS engines are
    designed to optimize member lookup when objects look the same, or
    when they come out of the same prototype. When you use Crockford’s
    functional inheritance pattern, you disable that optimization and
    can pay a noticeable perf penalty.

        Hi Chris,\
         This is an interesting topic. I would like to know if there is
        a material proof that prototyping is faster. Did anyone conduct
        any performance tests to conclude this?

        Thanks!

            Yes:

    In my single page web applications, I exclusively use functional
    inheritance. In a GUI environment the performance penalties aren’t
    really an issue and it saves a LOT of tedious mucking about with
    this = that; and other anti-patterns.

    I find doing this this way is much more natural to my background as
    a C\# developer, and makes it really easy to implement any OO design
    patterns I may need. I would be interested to see some figures on
    how much slower it is though!

        This benchmark clearly shows the difference in performance:
