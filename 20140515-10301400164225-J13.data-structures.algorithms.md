  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This newly expanded and updated second edition continues to take the
"mystery" out of designing algorithms, and analyzing their efficacy and
efficiency. Expanding on the first edition, the book now serves as the
primary textbook of choice for algorithm design courses while
maintaining its status as the premier practical reference guide to
algorithms for programmers, researchers, and students.

The reader-friendly Algorithm Design Manual provides straightforward
access to combinatorial algorithms technology, stressing design over
analysis. The first part, Techniques, provides accessible instruction on
methods for designing and analyzing computer algorithms. The second
part, Resources, is intended for browsing and reference, and comprises
the catalog of algorithmic resources, implementations and an extensive
bibliography.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

The second edition contains enough material to serve as the textbook for
a standard *Introduction to Algorithms* course. I assume the reader has
completed the equivalent of a second programming course, typically
titled *Data Structures* or *Computer Science II*.

The book, and associated supporting material, stresses design over
analysis. A full set of [lecture
slides](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/video-lectures/) integrated
with [audio and video
lectures](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/video-lectures/) are freely
available on line. Let me help teach your course! I received the 2001
[IEEE Computer Science and Engineering Teaching
Award](http://awards.computer.org/ana/award/viewPastRecipients.action;jsessionid=F53F830C57AC18E9525AD71F541C8E75?id=32)
and have been been teaching undergraduate algorithm classes for almost
twenty years.

I have made several pedagogical improvements throughout the book.
Textbook-oriented features include:

-   *More Leisurely Discussion* -- The tutorial material in the first
    part of the book has been *doubled* over the previous edition. The
    pages have been devoted to more thorough and careful exposition of
    fundamental material, instead of adding more specialized topics.
-   *False Starts* -- Algorithms textbooks generally present important
    algorithms as a fait accompli, obscuring the ideas involved in
    designing them and the subtle reasons why other approaches fail. The
    war stories illustrate such development on certain applied problems,
    but I have expanded such coverage into classical algorithm design
    material as well.
-   *Stop and Think* -- Here I illustrate my thought process as I solve
    a topic-specific homework problem---false starts and all. I have
    interspersed such problem blocks throughout the text to increase the
    problem-solving activity of my readers. Answers appear immediately
    following each problem.
-   *More and Improved Homework Problems* -- This edition of *The
    Algorithm Design Manual* has twice as many homework exercises as the
    previous one. Exercises that proved confusing or ambiguous have been
    improved or replaced. Degree of difficulty ratings (from 1 to 10)
    have been assigned to all problems.
-   *Self-Motivating Exam Design* -- In my algorithms courses, I promise
    the students that *all* midterm and final exam questions will be
    taken directly from homework problems in this book. This provides a
    \`\`student-motivated exam,'' so students know exactly how to study
    to do well on the exam. I have carefully picked the quantity,
    variety, and difficulty of homework exercises to make this work;
    ensuring there are neither too few or too many candidate problems.
-   *Take-Home Lessons* -- Highlighted \`\`take-home'' lesson boxes
    scattered throughout the text emphasize the big-picture concepts to
    be gained from the chapter.
-   *Links to Programming Challenge Problems* -- Each chapter's
    exercises will contain links to 3-5 relevant \`\`Programming
    Challenge'' problems from *http://www.programming-challenges.com*.
    These can be used to add a programming component to paper-and-pencil
    algorithms courses.
-   *More Code, Less Pseudo-code* -- More algorithms in this book appear
    as code (written in C) instead of pseudo-code. I believe the
    concreteness and reliability of actual tested implementations
    provides a big win over less formal presentations for simple
    algorithms. Full implementations are available for study at
    \\courseweb.

  [First Edition Errata](errata-old)
  ------------------------------------

First Edition
-------------

I was gratified by the warm reception the first edition of *The
Algorithm Design Manual* received since its publication. It ultimately
went through ten printings and generated numerous [errata](errata-old),
which remain available here.

The first edition came with a CD-ROM, with mirrors of [the algorithm
repository](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith) and my [audio/video
lecture notes](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/video-lectures).
Updated and improved versions of these resources are available on line,
rendering the CD-ROM unnecessary (although I fondly recall the fellow
who asked me for an extra copy so their child could have one when they
grew up).

This CD-ROM was also the source of the pirated online version from
[Indonesia](http://www2.toki.or.id/book/AlgDesignManual/). The [Amazon
Kindle
edition](http://www.amazon.com/The-Algorithm-Design-Manual/dp/B000YHD3VC/ref=ed_oe_o)
is better.

Reviews of *The Algorithm Design Manual* include:

-   From [Steve Yegge -- Get that Job at
    Google"](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html):
    \`\` My absolute favorite for this kind of interview preparation is
    Steven Skiena's The Algorithm Design Manual. More than any other
    book it helped me understand just how astonishingly commonplace (and
    important) graph problems are ? they should be part of every working
    programmer's toolkit. The book also covers basic data structures and
    sorting algorithms, which is a nice bonus. But the gold mine is the
    second half of the book, which is a sort of encyclopedia of 1-pagers
    on zillions of useful problems and various ways to solve them,
    without too much detail. Almost every 1-pager has a simple picture,
    making it easy to remember. This is a great way to learn how to
    identify hundreds of problem types.''
-   From [Programming
    Stuff](http://www.the-interweb.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/85-Book-review-The-Algorithm-Design-Manual.html):
    \`\`The book teaches you how to extract the relevant information
    from a problem, how to transform a given problem into a
    well-researched problem, how to select the best data structure for
    the job and how to really improve algorithms. .. That's what makes
    the book so different and yet so valuable.''

From the Publisher
------------------

Written by a well-known algorithms researcher who received the IEEE
Computer Science and Engineering Teaching Award, this new edition of
***The Algorithm Design Manual*** is an essential learning tool for
students needing a solid grounding in algorithms, as well as a special
text/reference for professionals who need an authoritative and
insightful guide.

### Quotes

"...the book is an algorithm-implementation treasure trove, and putting
all of these implementations in one place was no small feat. The list of
implementations [and] extensive bibliography make the book an invaluable
resource for everyone interested in the subject." **--ACM Computing
Reviews**

"It has all the right ingredients: rich contents, friendly, personal
language, subtle humor, the right references, and a plethora of pointers
to resources." **-- P. Takis Metaxas, Wellesley College**

"This is the most approachable book on algorithms I have." **-- Megan
Squire, Elon University, USA**
