Online education
================

### The disruption to come

Feb 11th 2014, 12:09 by R.A. | LONDON

THIS week's [Free exchange
column](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21595901-rise-online-instruction-will-upend-economics-higher-education-massive)
looks at the economics of online higher education:

> Two big forces underpin a university’s costs. The first is the need
> for physical proximity. Adding students is expensive—they require more
> buildings and instructors—and so a university’s marginal cost of
> production is high. That means that even in a competitive market,
> where price converges towards marginal cost, modern education is dear.
>
> It is also hard to raise productivity. University lecturers can teach
> at most a few hundred students each semester—the maximum that can be
> squeezed into lecture halls and exam-marking rosters. Because it is so
> labour intensive higher education relies on large numbers of
> instructors paid relatively modest salaries.
>
> MOOCs work completely differently. Alex Tabarrok, an economist at
> George Mason University and co-founder of an online-education site,
> Marginal Revolution University, reckons the most salient feature of
> the online course is its rock-bottom marginal cost: teaching
> additional students is virtually free. The fixed cost of creating an
> online course is relatively high, however. Getting started means
> putting together a curriculum, producing written and recorded material
> to explain it, and creating an interactive site that facilitates
> discussion and feedback.
>
> Having invested in the production of a course, a provider’s incentive
> is to sell it to as many students as possible. After the initial cost
> is covered each additional unit sold is pure profit. A low price
> maximises registrations and profit. But as prices converge towards
> marginal cost, there will be little scope for undercutting the
> competition. Instead MOOCs are likely to compete on quality, Mr
> Tabarrok reckons. Higher production costs are a small price to pay to
> attract much greater numbers of students. Such markets often evolve
> into winner-take-all, “superstar” competitions. The best courses
> attract the most customers and profit handsomely as a result. In this
> respect online education may more closely resemble information
> industries such as film-making than service industries such as
> hair-cutting.

The piece goes on to discuss how these economics might affect the
business models of different sorts of institutions of higher education:
of less-selective schools versus highly selective schools, for instance.
Building on the discussion in the piece, economist John Cochrane, of the
University of Chicago, offers a [very interesting
take](http://johnhcochrane.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/mooconomics.html) on
"Mooconomics" building on his own experience putting together online
courses. It's not an easy post to summarise and I recommend you read it
for yourself. But here is one clear takeaway:

> On these dimensions, online is about halfway. The forums, google
> chats, and growing community between students are not as good as a
> high quality classroom experience. They are much better than a
> mediocre class at a university in the middle of nowhere.

Many of those who get paid money to think and write about these issues
were educated at top universities. Their experience is one in which
peers are highly motivated and interested in the course material, in
which there is a high level of interaction between students and with top
faculty, and in which both learning for its own sake and a research
mission are considered vital parts of the university model. For people
educated in that environment, the MOOC model looks like a woefully
inadequate replacement for existing modes of higher education.

But that is not remotely the median experience in higher education. Many
more students (in America, at least, and probably elsewhere) have a very
practical view of the benefits of higher education, are paying
considerable sums of money to sit through mediocre lectures consisting
of fairly standardised material, are going to school at irregular hours
or intervals and are not interacting heavily with peers, and are
dropping out of school at relatively high rates. For these students, the
earliest online courses were "disruptive" in the sense that they offered
an alternative that was not as good for a much, much lower price. But
online offerings have very quickly evolved into something that is better
right the way round, and which will only continue to improve.

Students will soon find that for very low prices they can get a much
broader array of course choices, most of which offer superior
instruction with much more flexibility: you can view the lectures when
you want, as many times as you want, wherever you want. They may find
that opportunities for interaction with instructors and fellow students
are actually improved by the shift to online, because of the benefits of
economies of scale and the gains from temporal and spatial flexibility.
It will not be long before completion of particular MOOCs earn students
enough credit at "real" universities to enable students to get a "real"
degree. The stigma associated with MOOC learning should quickly flip to
status signalling, since anyone who can do an entire degree online is
probably disciplined and self-motivated.

It is very easy to see how elite universities survive this, as they
provide a fundamentally different experience. It is equally easy to see
how large segments of the world of higher education are rendered
unnecessary: where, within a decade or two, all that will remain of
hundreds or thousands of less-selective universities will be the
buildings—and a skilled teacher or two who built courses that prospered
in online markets.

That disruption will be very painful for many members of society,
especially those who enjoy good salaries and high status teaching
unremarkable courses at local universities. On the other hand, it will
be a terrific boon for all those with a desire to learn. The spillover
effects will carry well beyond the typical higher-education experience.
Good, cheap online education will allow people of all walks of life all
over the world to explore an enormous range of topics. Interested
secondary school students will have no reason not to take university
courses in economics. Middle-aged professionals can dabble in everything
from computer science to explorations of 18th century Baltic poetry. One
of the great advantages of online learning is the ability to work at
massive scale, which makes production of courses studying the tiniest
niche subjects economical.

There is also the distinct possibility that higher education will become
even *more* of a critical American export than it already is. America
will be able to sell its highly sought-after education services to even
more of the world. Of course, there will also be few barriers to entry
to talented course producers in Britain or Singapore or anywhere else.
But high fixed costs suggest there may be a first-mover advantage. It
will also be fascinating to see how geographical clustering of the
Mooc-making industry evolves. American higher education is very
geographically dispersed at the moment, but we tend to observe high
levels of geographic concentration in tradable industries. Which cities
will serve as the Hollywood of online education?

What will be interesting to observe, in the near term, is where the two
worlds meet and what happens at that juncture. How far down the ranks of
American universities will "elite status" protect current business
models? Beyond the top 20? The social shock of the arrival of online
education will be substantially greater if it devours the top echelon of
public universities.

There are many unknowns where higher education is concerned. But with
the MOOC experience rapidly overtaking, in quality, the standard
education at non-selective universities, dramatic change now looks
inevitable.

MOOCs just like virtual high schools only work for a small group of
academically strong super motivated students. These are people who have
been groomed since birth to succeed. They wont work for most public high
school students because they demand critical thinking, independent
reading, self motivation and time management. So either the failure rate
will stay high or a form of mediocre social promotion (credentialing)
will develop. (This already exists.)

What i can see is students in developing countries who are hungry enough
benefit. A mediocre online education and degree is better than none.

I'm curious about the meaning and evidence for John Cochrane's
assertions, "The forums, google chats, and growing community between
students are not as good as a high quality classroom experience. They
are much better than a mediocre class at a university in the middle of
nowhere." The first sentence seems to be a tautology. The second
sentence seems to be an empirical statement. Does Cochrane cite
evidence? If not, do you think we should believe the sentence because it
is asserted by an eminent economist?

It is all well and good to have one professor teach 10,000 students, but
who grades the papers? Can there ever be an essay question? Wouldn't it
be nice to get a personal evaluation from your professor? It seems
impossible in this system.

Half of college students today attend Community Colleges (CCs). These
are close to home and half the price of even state Universities. More
importantly they have smaller classes which provide more personal
contact needed by students who attend CCs. However, there is a place for
MOOCs and online learning in community college. MOOCs offer lectures by
world-class lecturers, something most CC professors are not. They offer
24/7 access and self-paced learning. Smart CC administrators and faculty
have begun to incorporate MOOCs in a blended model. This gives students
the best of both worlds. Online and blended learning enable CC students
to fit education into a life that has a job and family obligations.\

About time, don't you think? We could have done this with the telephone
and the talkies. Of course, a library card has also long been the ticket
to an education. But there has been and will be one great obstacle.

The American buys certification, not learning. When, and not until, that
is guaranteed will parents abandon the traditional college.

I've had some experience with students using MOOCs, students at lousy
low-end state colleges, and selective institutions. I'd say MOOCs have
their place, but you can't possibly get half the population through
college, which we want at a minimum to do, relying solely on them. The
dropout rate is much too high. It's higher than at the worst community
colleges. I can see a system that included MOOCs but also involved
students coming to campus and discussion classes, where instructors
could make sure the kids were on track and getting by. That might be a
future model for non-selective higher ed.

I think that MOOCs offered by the world's top universities, like MIT,
will have a significant transformative & disruptive impact in emerging
market nations, like India.

Already, Indians are second after Americans themselves to make use of
MOOCs.\
 Most of India's educational institutes are mediocre & focus on rote
learning, rather than developing & building analytical, logical &
reasoning abilities.\
 India is famous for IITians, who have a great cachet abroad. But what
eludes most people is that most other Indian educational institutes are
mediocre.

I hope that increasing internet penetration will transform the Indian
education system, raising its standards.\
 After experiencing the high quality of education of MOOCs of the
world's top universities, Indians will realize how shoddy their
education system is. Then the enlightened proles will demand more from
their complacent & feckless policymakers. They should at least, as ideal
consumers, demand to get the best bang for their buck at the mediocre
Indian universities.

As George Orwell wrote, "If there's hope, it lies in the proles".

In my opinion these two ways of learning can live together. Each of them
has its pros and cons. But what is certain is online platform for
teaching is a reality not future. We may take the example of Coursera,
which offers free courses of the top universities to everyone with great
results.

If we live in a world where online services are spreading every second
(anyone can get through internet almost everything), why online teaching
should be different.

In economics terms with virtual learning platform the society is using
the resources more efficiently that means more benefits for the society.

I read in this blog an article about the problem of the top universities
was having charging so high fees to the graduate that could not find any
suitable job after all. So things must change, and Why do not we learn
online?

"Two big forces underpin a university’s costs. The first is the need for
physical proximity. Adding students is expensive"

Baloney. Only one thing "underpins" a university's costs and that, in
America at least, is an out-of-control student loan program that each
year simultaneously creates millions of debt-serfs and bloated
administrations along with underworked professors.

The state university where I live increased its tuition 7200% from 1962
to 2013. While my friends and I paid for college by mowing lawns during
the summer it now requires contemporary kids to take on mortgage-sized
debt at a time when some of the boys aren't even shaving yet.

MOOC is a good idea but maybe not the future. There is still a lot to be
said for personal interaction.

However, I suggest that the "disruption to come" is what I (modestly)
call the Andros Plan and it is simplicity itself -- TAX THE COLLEGES AND
UNIVERSITIES, GET THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY BACK AND USE THAT TO PAY DOWN
STUDENT DEBT.

The colleges have no skin in the game. Whether the student graduates,
finds a job or has a useful skill it does not matter -- the colleges
keep all the gold and the student gets the shaft.

There are kids all over America, adults too, with a terrible debt burden
while the faculty and administration of our colleges live in a virtual
country club. Forget MOOCs . . . or use them for what they are worth.
Tax the gross income from colleges/universities and then apply that
directly to reducing individual student loan debt. Let the SOBs pay
their fair share like everyone else. I'd rather see some young adult
with $60,000 in student loans see that reduced to $30,000 then hear how
Whatsamatta U has built another damn rock-climbing wall.

(And, incidentally, neither I nor my kinder have student loans.)

I thought we had debunked the whole MOOC disruption thing?\
 We've had online learning, computer based training, online learning
communities, online tutorials, free stuff and paid stuff for 20 years.
We tried, tested, failed, succeeded, researched, analyzed and eventually
came up with some things that work, given the right conditions and
funding.

Interestingly, all the latest MOOC analysis and research has shown that
the stuff we already knew in the 90's is still true. It turns out that
the people with actual expertise in the field were correct.

Academics interested in MOOCs and online learning should wander over to
their education faculty and have a chat with some of their peers who
have some actual expertise and knowledge of the field.

I kind of don't see how the mooc economic model is going to hold up.
Simply creating a wiki-U, where the teaching materials are collectively
produced and refined, destroys the hold of rent seekers on
teaching/learning, leaving testing and certification up for grabs, but
even that could be solved in other open sourcey ways such as
recommendations a la LinkedIn. That leaves tutoring.

Most material taught on topics like math cover material that doesn't
really differ too much in explanation.

Try pointing a wiki page at xtranormal if you want a verbal lecture. I
don't buy the idea of rock star lecturers, noteriety for breadth aside.

That leaves a large problem for universities whose real product is

20 years from now abandoned college campuses built or expanded in
1990-2010 will be the places converted to make cheap office space for
startups and call centers. The gyms will be worth something, and the
student centers will be made into mini-malls. Former lecture halls will
be subdivided into rooms rented out by tutors (otherwise unemployed
PhDs) paid by the hour to help the weak students through their online
studies.

Just as journalists find it hard to make a living in a world without
classified ads, researchers in many fields will find it hard to make a
good living in a world without classes of undergraduates to teach.
They'll do a lot of tutoring.

The place where you find truly poor education in America is in the
public high schools in poor school districts. For ambitious and
motivated poor students, a MOOC-style high school education (yes, more
supervision is needed for 14-17 year olds) are a way to receive an
average education in an otherwise poor (in both senses of the word)
school district.

In the future I suspect the best students who don't have elite high
schools to choose from will opt for online education. I find the
prospect of a single great teacher lecturing on a subject to tens of
thousands of students (with tutorial support off-line) more realistic
than improving education through improving the skills of thousands of
bad teachers.

It seems that MOOCs are largely heirs, not to traditional universities,
but to university extension courses.\
 .\
 They have added more classes, and made it possible to get an entire
degree. But the basic approach -- individuals at a distance
geographically, going thru material on their own, and at their own pace
and schedule -- is the same.

Back to industry? Most wouldn't know where to find industry if you gave
them a map. They'll be teaching high school, until that gets displaced
by online learning. Then they'll just be tutors who help the student
after they've watched the online lecture and done the online interactive
worksheets.

Sure, cheap online education will be great for the same disadvantaged
but motivated autodidacts who frequent public libraries. But it sounds
inadequate for all the students who really need more personalized
assistance in order to grasp difficult course material. Will they be
shut out of the benefits of higher education when the labor-intensive
and less-selective universities have been hollowed out?

I would argue that online education benefits the students who need more
personalized assistance. It allows them to go at their own pace,
re-watch lectures, and eliminates the pressure that these students often
feel by being in a classroom surrounded by students who are learning at
quicker paces.

Further, the mediocre universities that will be most effected by the
growth of online-education are the ones that often lack the personalized
resources that these students require.

Good post, and interesting subject. As mentioned in an earlier comment
on the MOOC article, universities provide additional services that MOOCs
perhaps can't, at least not yet -\
 .\
 Signalling to employers that a student has the intelligence and drive
to get into a high-tier university, and a place for members of class
elites to meet and pair off.
