**Summary**: *This question is based on the common but erroneous belief
that there was no scientific progress in the Middle Ages. In fact,
modern historians of science have long since shown this to be a myth and
have gone on to show that far from being a scientific dark age, the
Medieval period lay the foundations of modern science.*\

\
*Pierre Duhem - the pioneer of early science history*\
\
This question is based on the common misconception that the Middle Ages
actually were a scientific dark age and that there genuinely was "little
real progress" in what we call science. This is the popular conception
of the period and pretty much how most people understand things -
nothing much happened in science, or "natural philosophy" in the
Medieval period until the Renaissance changed everything and the
Scientific Revolution began. But this idea is no longer accepted by
modern historians of science and the later Middle Ages is actually now
seen as a period in which there was not only the most scientific inquiry
since the ancient Greeks but also the period in which the intellectual
foundations of true, modern, empirical science were laid.\
\
The standard view of the Middle Ages as a scientific wasteland has
persisted for so long and is so entrenched in the popular mind largely
because it has deep cultural and sectarian roots, but not because it has
any real basis in fact. It is partly based on anti-Catholic prejudices
in the Protestant tradition, that saw the Middle Ages purely as a
benighted period of Church oppression. It was also promulgated by
Enlightenment scholars like Voltaire and Condorcet who had an axe to
grind with Christianity in their own time and projected this onto the
past in their polemical anti-clerical writings. By the later Nineteenth
Century the "fact" that the Church suppressed science in the Middle Ages
was generally unquestioned even though it had never been properly and
objectively examined.\
\
It was the early historian of science, the French physicist and
mathematician Pierre Duhem, who first began to debunk this
polemically-driven view of history. While researching the history of
statics and classical mechanics in physics, Duhem looked at the work of
the scientists of the Scientific Revolution, such as Newton, Bernoulli
and Galileo. But in reading their work he was surprised to find some
references to earlier scholars, ones working in the supposedly
science-free zone of the Middle Ages. When he did what no historian
before him had done before and actually read the work of Medieval
physicists like Roger Bacon (1214-1294), Jean Buridan (c. 1300- c.
1358), and Nicholas Oresme (c. 1320-1382) he was amazed at their
sophistication and he began a systematic study of the until then ignored
Medieval scientific flowering of the Twelfth to Fifteenth Centuries.\
\
What he and later modern historians of early science found is that the
Enlightenment myths of the Middle Ages as a scientific dark age
suppressed by the dead hand of an oppressive Church were nonsense. Duhem
was a meticulous historical researcher and fluent in Latin, meaning he
could read Medieval scientific works that had been ignored for
centuries. And as one of the most renowned physicists of his day, he was
also in a unique position to assess the sophistication of the works he
was rediscovering and of recognising that these Medieval scholars had
actually discovered elements in physics and mechanics that had long been
attributed to much later scientists like Galileo and Newtown. This did
not sit well with anti-clerical elements in the intellectual elite of
his time and his publishers were pressured not to publish the later
volumes of his *Systeme de Monde*: *Histoire des Doctrines cosmologiques
de Platon à Copernic* - the establishment of the time was not
comfortable with the idea of the Middle Ages as a scientific dark age
being overturned. Duhem died with his painstaking work largely
unpublished in 1916 and it was only the efforts of his daughter Helene's
30 year struggle for her father's opus to see the light of day that saw
the whole 10 volume work finally released in 1959.\
\
By then Duhem was no longer alone in seeing the idea of the Middle Ages
as a period of no science as a baseless myth. The American historian of
science Lynn Thorndike had followed the same trail as Duhem and came to
the same conclusions that Medieval scientists had been wrongfully
ignored and neglected since the Enlightenment, largely for political and
ideological reasons. In his eight volume *History of Magic and
Experimental Science* (1923-1958) he too found that science in the
Middle Ages was remarkably wide-ranging, speculative and highly
sophisticated. These pioneers in the field of early science history have
now been followed by a long list of historians of the subject that have
made this neglected period in scientific history even more clear.
Current leading scholars in the field such as David Lindberg, Ronald
Numbers and Edward Grant have revolutionised our understanding of how
the scientists of the Middle Ages built on the work they inherited from
the Greeks and Arabs, advanced knowledge further and laid the
foundations of modern science as we know it. \
\
Grant's ground-breaking 1996 book *The Foundations of Modern Science in
the Middle Ages* shows in detail that the Scientific Revolution of the
Seventeenth Century simply could not have happened if western European
scholarship had remained as it had been prior to the early Twelfth
Century, or even if it has stayed as it had been in the later Third
Century. It took not just the scientific advances but the intellectual
changes of the later Middle Ages to set the scene for Galileo and
Newton. Rather than being a dark aqe, the high Middle Ages made true
modern science possible. More recently, James Hannam's *God's
Philosophers: How the Medieval World Laid the Foundations of Modern
Science* (2009) has presented a critically-acclaimed popularisation of
modern scholarship on the subject, in an attempt to try to correct
several centuries of prejudice and error that persists in the popular
imagination.\

\
\
**The*****Actual*****Scientific Dark Age**\
\
Of course, there certainly was a period in which western natural
philosophy did stagnate and then languish and in which the whole
scientific tradition of the Greeks and Romans was in danger of being
lost. Later Hellenic and then Roman scholars inherited the work of the
Greek proto-scientists of the Fourth and Fifth Centuries BC and built on
it. By the First Century AD Roman scholars tended to read Greek and so
could read the works of Aristotle and Archimedes in their original
languages, but there was also an increasing tradition of encyclopaedic
collections of summaries and key points from earlier Greek works which
tended to be compiled in Latin. The scholars of the First and Second
centuries added some major contributions to science, especially Ptolemy
(astronomy and mathematics) and Galen (medicine), but many Roman
scholars made do with the Latin summaries and encyclopaedias for their
grasp of earlier work.\
\
In the Third Century, however, there were major social and political
upheavals that interrupted many aspects of Roman life, including
scholarship, with profound later consequences. The Empire entered what
is now called "the Military Anarchy", where rival emperors rose and fell
in rapid succession and the Empire was racked with decade after decade
of civil war and political oppression. The weakened Empire suffered from
invasions by the newly resurgent Sassanian Persians and by larger and
more aggressive federations of Germanic barbarians. Cities that had been
peaceful for centuries began constructing defensive walls, resources
that once went into buildings and public works went into endless wars
and at one point the Empire even split into three parts.\
\
A form of stability was imposed by a new kind of more centralised and
more monarchical emperorship, economic reforms and an overhaul of the
army and the Imperial administration by Diocletian and his successors,
but parts of the Empire never fully recovered, especially in the west.
Intellectual life and education, which had been badly disrupted in the
long century of chaos, certainly did not regain its former strength and
in the west fewer and fewer scholars were literate in Greek. As a
result, works that were only available in Greek, especially technical,
philosophic and detailed scientific works, were read and copied far less
and began to be neglected. Greco-Roman science was increasingly
preserved only in the popular Latin encyclopaedic tradition rather than
studied in detail via the original Greek works.\
\
By the Fifth Century the administrative division between the
Latin-speaking Western Empire and the Greek-speaking Eastern Empire
became permanent and then became a political divide. The weaker, poorer
and more vulnerable Western Empire did not even survive the century,
with its final collapse coming in 476 AD after another century of civil
wars, invasions and spiralling decline. What followed was centuries of
invasions, fragmentation and chaos, with few brief periods of stability
and centralised authority. The faltering intellectual tradition, which
had already been in decline since the late Second Century, languished to
a low ebb.\
\
The institution which managed to keep this faltering tradition from
dying out altogether during these centuries of barbarian invasion and
disintegration was actually the one the Enlightenment myth (wrongly)
blames for causing the decline in the first place. The Christian church
came to hold political power when the decline in learning in the west
had been under way for over a century, and so could not have been its
cause. Initially Christianity was ambivalent toward Greek philosophy and
learning, but prominent Christian thinkers who had been trained in
philosophy could see it as something to be embraced. God, they argued,
was a rational intelligence and had created the universe along rational
lines. It made sense, therefore, that humans could and should use reason
to understand his creation. Clement of Alexandria argued that just as
the Jews had been given a divine gift of special religious revelation,
so had the Greeks been given a gift of rational analysis. Both were to
be embraced and used.\
\
So when the Western Empire collapsed, the Church had long since come to
terms with Greek philosophy and science and found ways to incorporate
both and reconcile them with their religion. And it was Christian
scholars who saw that the decline of Greek literacy in the west meant
much of the original works of Greek learning were being lost.
Cassiodorus and Boethius both tried to preserve key works by translating
them into Latin. Boethius was executed before he could complete an
ambitious plan to translate all the works of Aristotle, but he did
manage to translate most of the key works on logic - something which
meant that logic and therefore reason took a central role in early
Medieval education, even in the darkest centuries of the chaos. The
seeds of the Medieval revival of science lay in that stroke of luck.\

\
**The Medieval Enshrining of Reason**\
\
One writer has compared the long road back from the intellectual
catastrophe of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire on learning in
western Europe to people after a nuclear holocaust trying to revive
modern science with nothing but a few volumes of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica and a copy of Bill Bryson's*A Short History of Nearly
Everything*. Scholars in the Eighth or Ninth Centuries had just enough
fragments of information to know that they had barely anything at all
but not enough to begin reconstructing what had been lost. What is
interesting is what they did with the bits they had - they revered them.
These ancient writers, mostly pagans, were held up as all-knowing
authorities and what elements of their works did survive were studied
with immense reverence and painstaking scrutiny.\
\
This meant particular attention was paid to one of the few areas in
which a reasonable number of works had survived - logic, or "dialectic"
as it was known. A grasp of logic was central to Medieval education and
a student had to master it, via Boethius' translations of Aristotle and
other works, before they could tackle any other subjects. This had the
curious effect of enshrining reason as the key to all knowledge - a
development completely at odds with the popular view of the Middle Ages
and the Medieval church in particular as being fixated on unquestioned
dogma and irrational superstition. There were certainly things that
these Medieval scholars accepted on faith but they increasingly came to
feel they could also arrive at them, and all kinds of other forms of
understanding about the universe, via reason. In a strange way, the loss
of so much Greek philosophy actually focused attention on the elements
that had survived and had the effect of enshrining *reason*at the heart
of Medieval thought in a way not seen before. \
\
By the Eleventh Century the waves of Avar, Magyar, Saracen and Viking
invaders had begun to recede, Europe had recovered economically and
stabilised politically and was actually on the brink of a period of
outward expansion. At the same time there was an expansion of literacy
and interest in learning and an increasingly acute awareness of the loss
of ancient learning and what scholars of the time lamented as *Latinorum
penuria* ("the poverty of the Latins"). Exactly how intellectually poor
the Latin west was is illustrated by an exchange of letters between two
early Eleventh Century scholars, Ragimbold of Cologne and Radolf of
Liege, about some mathematical problems that would not bother a high
school student today. Here were two clearly intelligent men who were
seen as leading scholars of their day (the letters were copied and
widely circulated) competing to solve some basic geometry problems but
being forced to do so using scraps of geometry from old Roman surveying
manuals and from a Sixth Century encyclopaedia that did little more than
define a few terms. It's an illustration both of how much had been lost
in the cataclysm and how eager people were to recover lost learning.\
\
The idea that the cosmos was rational and could be analysed via reason
was certainly resisted by some conservatives, but a new guard of
scholars came increasingly to the fore, including William of Conches,
Honorius of Autun, Bernard Silvester, Adelard of Bath, Thierry of
Chartres and Clarenbold of Arras. William of Conches wrote with scorn of
those who were suspicious of this worship of reason and rational
analysis:\

> \
> *Ignorant themselves of the forces of nature and wanting to have
> company in their ignorance, they do not want people to look into
> anything; they want us to believe like peasants and not ask the reason
> behind things .... But we say the reason behind everything should be
> sought out!*\
> (William of Conches (c. 1090-1154 AD), *Philosophia mundi*)\

\
Intellectuals like William were increasingly attracting communities of
students and gathering together with these students to share ideas,
laying the foundations of the schools that were to become universities.
The stage was set for a genuine revival and flowering of learning, all
Europe still lacked were the lost books of the Greeks and Romans.\

\
\
**The New Learning and the Universities**\

\
By the early Eleventh Century European scholars were not just aware of
how much western Europe had lost, but they were also aware that many of
these works survived and could be regained. They used the phrase
*Latinorum penuria*because they knew there were others who were not so
poor - namely the Greeks and the Arabs. With a reviving western Europe
now expanding militarily in all directions, it became easier for eager
scholars to get access to these works and redress the balance. The
capture of the great Muslim centre of learning in Toledo in 1085 led
many scholars to Spain in search of lost books and the Norman conquest
of Sicily in 1091 opened up libraries of Arabic, Hebrew and Greek
literary treasures. And by the Twelfth Century scholars flocked to
Sicily, southern Italy and Spain to translate these books into Latin and
bring them home. One of them was a young Englishman, Daniel of Morely:\
\

> *I heard that the doctrine of the Arabs, which is devoted almost
> entirely to the quadrivium, was all the fashion in Toledo in those
> days, I hurried there as quickly as I could, so that I could hear the
> wisest philosophers of the world … Eventually my friends begged me to
> come back from Spain; so, on their invitation, I arrived in England,
> bringing a precious multitude of books with me.*\

\
Over the next two centuries many more "precious multitudes of books"
made their way north to the schools and burgeoning universities of
Europe and "new" Greek learning began to flood into Europe at precisely
the point where the intellectual culture there was ready for
stimulation.\
\
What is remarkable is which books the translators concentrated on. There
was no shortage of Orthodox Greek theological works or even ancient
Greek and Roman plays and poems available in Sicily and Spain, but these
were generally ignored. The eager scholars from the north concentrated
overwhelmingly on works on mathematics, astronomy, physics, logic and
philosophy as well as medicine, optics and natural history. They were
not interested in plays and poems (leaving them to be "rediscovered"
later by the humanist scholars of the Renaissance) - these Medieval
scholars were interested in the fruits of **reason**: science, logic and
philosophy.\
\
And the impact of these recovered works and the works by later Greek
commentators and by Arabic scholars that accompanied them, had a
revolutionary impact on the new network of universities that began
springing up all over western Europe. These new centres of learning took
the scholarly framework of the old cathedral schools' curriculum based
on the "seven liberal arts" but combined it with the structure of craft
and merchant guilds (which is where the name *universitas*came from as
well). As in the guilds, students had to choose to work under the
guidance of a "Master" and serve a long, structured and scrutinised
apprenticeship and then pass a series of tests and oral examinations
before being judged a "Master" himself and finally going on to become a
"Doctor" or teacher. This structure, hierarchy and rigorous testing made
the Medieval university very different to similar-seeming schools in the
Islamic world or the academies of ancient Greece.\
\
The other radical and crucial novelty in the university system was the
way advancement and prominence in this system was not gained merely by
mastering material from key texts, but by disputation and debate using
set rules of formal logic. Masters and doctors maintained their
positions and their reputations (and therefore their incomes from
students) by their ability to win debates, often throwing open the floor
to all comers. And brilliant students could rise quickly in reputation
and renown by taking on these masters and beating them. At least twice a
year a university would hold a *quodlibeta*- a multi-day tournament of
rigorous logical disputation where anyone could propose and defend any
position on any subject at all. Often highly radical, controversial,
paradoxical or even heretical idea were presented and participants had
to defend or attack them using logic and reason alone.The idea of a
rational free-for-all where the finest minds of the time used reason
alone to bat around ideas like "God is in fact evil" or "the universe
had no beginning in time" certainly does not fit most people's ideas of
the Middle Ages, yet this was a regular event in Medieval universities.\

\
**The Medieval Proto-Scientific Revolution**\
\
In this new environment of revived ancient learning, rigorous rational
analysis and vigorous debate and investigation, Medieval Europe saw the
first real flowering of scientific innovation since the ancient Greeks.
Developing ideas proposed by earlier Arabic scholars like Al Battani,
Robert Grosseteste proposed that scholar should not only derive
universal laws from particulars and then apply laws to particular cases
(Aristotle's "principle of induction), but they should also use
experiment to verify the particulars. Roger Bacon developed this idea
further, proposing a method based on a repeated cycle of observation,
hypothesis and experimentation. Both men applied this method to the
study of optics, the physical nature of light, the function of the eye
and the nature of lenses. It was this analysis, which was an area of
science Medieval scholars found particularly fascinating, which seems to
have led to the invention of eye-glasses. Bacon also described the
construction and function of a telescope, though it's unclear if he
actually built one.\
\
With the Medieval development of the underlying scientific principles of
observation and repeatable experimentation came probably the most
revolutionary Medieval contribution to the rise of true modern science:
the use of mathematics as a language to describe the physical world.
Aristotle and the Greeks had considered it bad practice to try to
extrapolate from one discipline (like mathematics or geometry) to
another (such as physics). But with the development of more
sophisticated ideas of reasoning from observation and induction in the
Thirteenth Century, thanks to the likes of Grosseteste and Bacon,
Fourteenth Century scholars hit on the idea of making observation and
induction more precise by using mathematics as the language of physics.
Thomas Bradwardine wrote:\
\

> *[Mathematics] is the revealer of every genuine truth, for it knows
> every hidden secret and bears the key to every subtlety of letters.
> Whoever, then, has the effrontery to pursue physics while neglecting
> mathematics should know from the start that he will never make his
> entry through the portals of wisdom.*

\
\
Bradwardine was one of a group of scholars who worked on key issues in
physics using this new insight. Along with William Heytesbury, Richard
Swineshead and John Dumbleton and building on the work of William of
Occam and Walter Burley, these Oxford University scholars became known
as the Merton Calculators and they lay the foundations for modern
physics as we know it.\
\
Most importantly, they overturned the earlier Greek conception of motion
by distinguishing kinematics from dynamics. Aristotle and other Greek
scholars had seen motion purely as a matter of external force, whereas
the Merton scholars looked at the persistence of motion via impetus -
measurable by material volume and velocity. This laid the foundations
for the later key understanding of momentum, but also allowed them to
formulate the Mean Speed Theorum. This was long attributed to Galileo,
but it is now clear that it was the Merton Calculators who discovered
and proved this principle long before Galileo was born (there is also
some evidence that he read of their work and presented the idea as his
own without attribution).\
\
These ideas about impetus allowed later Medieval scholars to develop
physics further and begin to apply them to astronomy. So Nicole Oresme
was able to use impetus to show that most of the ancient Greek
objections to the possibility of a revolving earth were invalid. He
still believed that the earth was stationary on other grounds, but his
arguments were later taken and used by Copernicus in the development of
heliocentrism. Orseme, Jean Buridan and Nicholas of Cusa were also able
to show how impetus is a constant motive power that is corrupted or
halted only when it encounters some form of resistance. This allowed
Medieval physicists to set aside the Greek idea that celestial motions
took place in some incorruptible heavenly realm where earthly physics
did not apply and meant people could start applying principles
discovered on earth to the motions of the heavens.\
\
The idea that Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Newton all developed ideas
that had no roots in the thinking of the two or three centuries that
preceded them is clearly ridiculous, yet this has been the claim of the
post-Enlightenment myths about the Middle Ages. Objective modern
research, however, has shown that without the work of people like
Grosseteste, Bacon, Occam, the Merton scholars, Oresme and Buridan the
"Scientific Revolution" would never had occurred. That revolution had
Medieval foundations.\

\
\
**The Church's Suppression of Ideas?**\
\
Actually, nothing of the history detailed above sits neatly with the
idea of the Medieval Church as a violent and intolerant theocracy that
immediately consigned anyone with the whiff of a new idea to the flames.
In fact, the parameters for speculation and investigation into the
nature of the physical world were quite wide, because the Medieval
Church considered the cosmos to the the rational product of the rational
mind of God and that humans were given reason partly so they could
apprehend and investigate the universe rationally.\
\
This is why Thomas Aquinas spent years and many millions of words
painstakingly applying the rational principles of ancient Greek
dialectic to Christian theology in an attempt at showing that all the
key ideas of Christian belief could be arrived at by pure reason. It is
also why the *quodlibeta*debates at Medieval universities were such open
free-for-alls where all kinds of radical and even heretical ideas could
be proposed to see if they stood up to logical analysis.\
\
The Medieval Church also did not insist on a purely literal
interpretation of the Bible (fundamentalist literalism is a modern and
largely American Protestant idea). This meant that it had no problem
with seeing aspects of the Bible as purely allegorical and with the
exploration of how their symbolic truth relates to the real world. Most
people who think of the Medieval period as one where Biblical
literalists suppressed original thinking though fear would have a hard
time explaining, for example, the work of William of Conches. Way back
in the Twelfth Century this scholar, based at Chartres Cathedral,
accepted that his audience already understood the creation story in
Genesis to be symbolic and went on to interpret it "according to
nature'. He proposed how natural forces set in motion by God brought
about the form of the heavens and earth as we have them today. He went
on to talk about life arising from the primordial mud by the natural
action of heat and how it developed from simple early forms. He even
talks about how man arose in the same way and how, in theory, some other
species of man could arise via natural processes in the same way.\
\
All these very modern-sounding (even Darwinian) ideas were accepted by
Medieval scholars without the slightest problem and the Church had no
difficulty with them either - indeed, William of Conches, like all other
Medieval scientists - *was*a churchman.\

\
The closest the Church came to suppressing science in any way was when,
in reaction to some of the ideas being debated in the University of
Paris at the height of the rediscovery of Aristotelian learning in the
Thirteenth Century, the Faculty of Theology attempted at putting some
limits on what could be discussed by the Faculty of Arts. In 1210, 1270
and again in 1277 the Pope, at the request of the Parisian Theology
Faculty, published lists of ideas proposed by Aristotle or implied by
his philosophy that were contrary to Christian doctrine and so were
forbidden. What is remarkable about this is, firstly, how little in
Aristotle etc was actually proscribed by these Condemnations. Secondly,
it's remarkable how ineffective the Condemnations were. They only
applied to Paris, whereas discussion of all these topics continued at
Oxford and other universities unaffected. And, as the fact that they had
to be repeated twice indicates, they were widely ignored anyway. They
also had another effect - by arguing that Aristotle was actually wrong
on several key points, they stimulated a more critical examination of
the Greek philosopher's work which led to several of his idea being
critically analysed and found to be incorrect (eg the idea that a heavy
object falls faster than a lighter one). IN a strange way, the
Condemnations failed to suppress science and actually helped to
stimulate it.\
\
The fact is that the idea of the Church suppressing science and rational
analysis of the physical world is a myth. Not one Medieval scholar was
ever burned, imprisoned or oppressed by the Medieval Church for making a
claim about the physical world. This why the modern proponents of the
myth always have to fall back on an exceptional and post-Medieval
example to prop up this idea: the Galileo case.\
\
**Conclusion**\
\
So the claim that "science made little clear progress in Europe in the
Middle Ages" is based on a profound ignorance of the period and depends
on a prejudiced myth that is without any basis. Once Medieval Europe
recovered from the chaos that followed the fall of Rome, it quickly
revived the ancient tradition of natural philosophy that had been
languishing since Roman times. Medieval scholars engaged in a remarkable
process of examining the physical universe using reason and logic and,
in doing so, developed principles that were to become the foundations of
modern science proper. And they applied these principles in ways that
corrected errors the Greeks had made and did the ground work for the
later discoveries in physics and astronomy that made up the beginning of
the Scientific Revolution. While people with no detailed knowledge of
modern studies in the history of science still cling to Nineteenth
Century myths about the Church suppressing science, it is now clear that
without the flowering of speculation and analysis in the period from the
Twelfth to the Fifteenth Century, western science would never have
arisen at all.\
