Let me go ahead and say it. I think you should consider switching from
your current introductory physics textbook to [*Matter and
Interactions*](http://matterandinteractions.org/) (by Chabay and
Sherwood – published by Wiley). *[Matter and
Interactions](http://matterandinteractions.org/)* is a calculus-based,
first-year physics curriculum. But wait! It’s not just any ordinary
physics textbook. No, this one is different.

Before looking at the positive aspects of this book, let me give you an
assignment. Go around your office and your neighbor’s office and find
some older versions of introductory textbooks. Maybe you found a first
edition of *Fundamentals of Physics* by Halliday and Resnick (first
published in 1960). That’s a pretty cool book. Now look through the old
book and compare it to the textbook you are currently using. No matter
what the publisher says, they are pretty much the same (yes, with
different pictures and more color and MORE SIDE BAR STUFF). Just as a
note, I’m not a big fan of the sidebar info in textbooks. If it’s
important, then put it in the text. If it’s unimportant, then just leave
it out.

So why do we keep using essentially the same format for physics
textbooks for over 50 years? I call this Academic Inertia. If you are a
physics faculty, you probably took undergraduate physics at some point
and that course probably used a textbook. So, when you have a choice of
textbooks you would feel comfortable with a textbook similar to the one
you grew up with, right? I suspect this is what happens in physics
departments across the world (and maybe even in the whole universe).

But students use the textbook (at least they are supposed to), and not
the faculty, right? Yes, this is true. However, the faculty pick the
textbook and not the students. What does this mean? This means that if a
publisher wants to sell a new textbook, they need to market it to
faculty and not to students. It’s kind of weird when you think about it.

Ok, so why should you consider *Matter and Interactions*? Here are some
reasons.

1. It’s Not Your 1960 Textbook
------------------------------

Go ahead and compare the table of contents with your current textbook
and [that from *Matter and
Interactions*](http://matterandinteractions.org/Content/Adopters/adopters.html).
See. It’s different. Different isn’t bad. The *Matter and Interactions*
content is more focused on the fundamental ideas. It isn’t a giant book
that contains a bunch of stuff that you will never get to in just 2
semester. Now, don’t get me wrong. Fluid dynamics and sound levels are
both cool and important. However, you just can’t cover everything in a
one semester course.

2. This Isn’t the Same as a High School Course.
-----------------------------------------------

This was a great point made by [Chad Orzel in a recent Google Hangout we
recorded](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQrumaUP4Ng&feature=share).
Often times, students come into the intro college physics course after
taking HS physics. With a traditional textbook, the course tends to
start with kinematics and then move to forces and things like that. The
problem is that some of these students *think* this is easy and that
they have covered it already. They fall into an illusion of
understanding that encourages them to NOT spend much time on physics.
Well, of course they are wrong but they don’t realize how far they get
behind until around the section on energy. By then, it’s often too late
to catch up.

Really, many of the initial ideas in *Matter and Interactions* are
essentially the same as a high school course. However, they LOOK
different. With this difference, student might just hit the books sooner
rather than later.

3. Numerical Calculations
-------------------------

Let me just give a definition (my definition) of numerical calculations
so that we all agree on the terms.

> **Numerical Calculation:** The process of solving a problem by
> breaking it into many (but finite) steps. As an example, the motion of
> a ball can be determined by calculating the change in momentum and
> position over a small time interval during which we can approximate
> the force as being constant (even if it isn’t). Typically, these many
> small steps are calculated with a computer (electronic computer) but
> they could be calculated manually.

Now you know what I mean. You might call it something else, but that is
the term I like. The point is that *Matter and Interactions* includes
explicit ideas about numerical calculations and this a good thing. Let’s
face it. Numerical calculations are just as legit as analytical
calculations (using stuff like calculus). If a solution gives answers
that agree with real life, then it is a good solution.

We live in a world of cheap and fast computers such that numerical
calculations are a fairly standard solution method in just about every
scientific and engineering field. Students might as well start using
them right away, right?

Oh? But you aren’t a computer scientist or a programmer? That’s ok, the
curriculum uses [VPython](http://www.vpython.org) – a visual module that
goes with python that makes numerical calculations mostly painless. And
it’s not just you. Some students also think that programming shouldn’t
be in physics courses – [but they are
wrong.](http://www.wired.com/2014/02/isnt-physics-computer-science/)

4. Modern Ideas
---------------

What is a modern physics idea? We all know that by “modern” we mean
stuff that was figured out 100 years ago. You know, things like
relativity and quantum mechanics as well as fundamental particles and
the atomic nature of matter. Yes, I know that many introductory physics
textbooks. However, they are extra chapters at the end in an already
huge book.

*Matter and Interactions* is different. At the beginning, the idea of
momentum is introduced as the following:

![La te xi t
1](http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/la_te_xi_t_112.jpg)

If the object is moving much slower than the speed of light, then this
momentum can be approximated as *mv*. But it starts off with a useful
momentum model that works with the momentum principle. The textbook
doesn’t wait until those final chapters to introduce this idea, it’s
right there in the beginning.

5. Focus on the Basics
----------------------

I guess this is sort of the same as idea number 1. The first volume of
*Matter and Interactions* is essentially three big ideas. The second
volume is mostly just two big ideas. Putting these all together, a
student would cover the following:

-   The Momentum Principle
-   The Work-Energy Principle
-   The Angular Momentum Principle
-   Electric Fields
-   Magnetic Fields

These ideas are the building blocks of most of the later physics
courses. Focus of the basics and remove all the excessive stuff.

But Wait! What About \_\_\_\_\_\_\_?
------------------------------------

I’m aware that there are other physics textbooks out there that aren’t
traditional. Yes, the *[Feynman
Lectures](http://www.feynmanlectures.info/)* and *[Six Ideas That Shaped
Physics](http://amzn.com/0072397144)* are two examples I can think of.
Those are nice textbooks too (but maybe the Feynman Lectures isn’t a
textbook). For me, I am sticking with *Matter and Interactions*. I
suggest you at least take a look.
