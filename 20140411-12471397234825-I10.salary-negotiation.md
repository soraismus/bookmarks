[Negotiating Startup Job Offers](http://blog.mightyspring.com/post/82113317607/negotiating-startup-job-offers)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Negotiating compensation may not be most people’s idea of a good time,
but it doesn’t have to be a painful experience either. As a recruiter at
recruitment agencies both big (Robert Half, Kforce) and small
(VonChurch), I helped countless people negotiate with their prospective
employers.

While we make ourselves available to help every user of [Mighty
Spring](https://www.mightyspring.com/getstarted) negotiate their
incoming job offers, in this post I’ll outline the “hows” and “whats” of
a good negotiation for everyone else, too.

**Build the Relationship**

A good interview process sets the stage for an enjoyable and and
fulfilling working relationship, with only one pitfall-laiden obstacle
in the way: the negotiation. Your goal is to navigate this discussion
nimbly and start your employment off on the right foot.

Negotiating obnoxiously can send negative signals to your prospective
employer, but a smart, graceful negotiation can further solidify the
employer’s decision to hire you.

The negotiation is a reflection of how you conduct business in general,
and therefore, how the employer can expect you to conduct business on
their behalf. Do you consider all of the details at hand and seek a
favorable, but fair, result? Or do you focus foolishly on optimizing
relatively unimportant details?

Remember, though you’re on opposite sides of the negotiating table,
you’re working together to define a compensation structure that works
for both of you. A successful negotiation marks the start of a long-term
relationship, so neither side wants the other to walk away feeling like
they got a raw deal. Start building a good work relationship early by
negotiating intelligently.

**Understand the Lasting Impact**

Negotiation performance compounds over many years, as salary increases
(both inside an organization from a raise and outside via a job change),
are often defined as a percentage increase over your most recent year’s
wages.

For this reason, it’s generally better to seek a salary increase instead
of a lump-sum performance or signing bonus whenever possible — salary
increases raise the baseline for future compensation conversations,
lump-sum bonuses don’t.

**Know Yourself (and Your Situation)**

The best way to strengthen your position in a negotiation (and ensure an
outcome that you’re happy with) is to be as clear as possible with
yourself about your needs and wants.

Know answers to questions like, “How badly do I want this job versus my
alternatives?” and, “What is my walk-away minimum salary?” before you
enter a negotiation. This will help you address the toughest parts of
the conversation with confidence.

Answering with a clear, unwavering, “No,” when presented with an offer
that is below your minimum is the most powerful way to point things back
in the right direction when a negotiation is going south. However, don’t
try to fake this — if your opposition finds out that “no” actually
means, “probably not”, you lose a lot of leverage!

On the point of losing the impact of your word: any party you negotiate
with is likely to remember your behavior forever. So, if you find
yourself across the table from someone for a second time addressing the
possibility of a raise, your performance during your previous
negotiation may leave you wanting for a few more dollars!

**Know the Market**

Once you’ve come to terms with your personal circumstances, it’s time to
understand the market.

Your goal is to have clarity about the high-end, low-end, and mid-range
compensation packages that are being offered for your prospective
position across multiple companies, preferably competitors. If you are
dealing with a position and company in which equity is part of the
package, you should also understand the equity ranges that the market
supports.

Equity tends to be a tricky subject, as Restricted Stock Units, Common
Stock, Stock Options etc, all differ. Regardless of type, it’s important
to understand the real value of the equity offered. To do this, you must
be able to answer questions like:

What percentage of the company today does this equity represent?

-   (Offered Shares/Total Issued Shares)

What fully-diluted percentage of the company does this equity represent?

-   (Offered Shares/Total Authorized Shares)

What is today’s value of the offered equity?

-   (Per-Share-Price X Offered Shares)

How long does it take for me to earn the equity?

-   (4 year vesting/1 year cliff is standard)

Does my equity come with voting rights?

-   (Stock can have different classes; some have voting rights)

This said, equity is really only worth worrying about if it makes up a
significant portion of your compensation. If you’ve been offered
market-rate salary plus some equity, then that equity stake probably
isn’t worth quibbling over.

On the other hand, if you’ve been asked to accept less-than-market
salary, or the company is yet-unproven (ie, you are taking on
occupational risk that exceeds the market average — as is often the case
in very early-stage companies), with the expectation that the equity
offered makes up for it, it’s vital to understand the details of the
equity package.

Focus your negotiation energies on what’s really important. When equity
is important, make sure you clearly understand the economics and
financial structure of the company before negotiating.

**Recognize the Unique Circumstances**

No two companies are exactly alike. Because of this, it’s important to
balance market norms with the unique characteristics of your prospective
employer and offer:

Are they very early-stage with an exceptional team full of experienced
leaders? Perhaps less than market-rate salary is reasonable if the
equity figure is appropriate.

Or are you requesting remote-work privileges every other week, while
everyone else on the team is full-time on-site? Your pay may be slightly
reduced in exchange for this flexibility.

Always consider what is unique about the particular situation – both
yours and the company’s – before opening the negotiation.

**Leverage Solid Tactics**

Entire books have been written about negotiation tactics, but here are
three of the most useful tips that you can put to good use immediately:

1.  Set the framework

When possible, you want provide the basic framework that both sides will
use for their calculations. For example, “Can we agree that salary
should be a function of an individual’s capabilities, their impact on
the businesses bottom line, and cost of living in their city?”

If you set the framework, you have the chance to include or exclude the
elements that you foresee being vital points of leverage later on in the
discussion. If the other side moves to set the framework first, make
sure all of your decision-making criteria are also included in the
framework before moving on to individual points.

2.  Bring everything to the table

If you bring a lot of elements into the discussion, you have more chips
to bargain with. You may be able to exchange three or four things of
relative unimportance for one item on your opponent’s side that you care
about quite dearly.

If you are going to have to give up something at some point, it might as
well be something you care little about.

3.  Leverage an outside decision-maker

Sometimes it’s good not to be the final decision-maker. Imagine saying,
“Well, this sounds like a great offer, but I don’t think my spouse will
let me take a job with fewer than three weeks of vacation time.” This
line helps you to create a “good cop, bad cop” dynamic, leaving your
opposition to negotiate against someone who isn’t even there!

**Conclusion**

If you’re reading this because you have a salary negotiation in the near
future, congratulations! These things usually turn out well if you
follow the above lessons.

Remember, you are working with someone else to reach a fair agreement,
not trying to “win.” Being transparent and honest in your communication
will go a long way to achieving that goal.
