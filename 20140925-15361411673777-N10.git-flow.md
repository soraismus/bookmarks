[Ask HN: Who uses gitflow?](item?id=8336633)

We're looking at switching to gitflow
(http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), but the
decision makers are on the fence. Are there any examples of a successful
gitflow project?

 My team uses gitflow as part of our normal development process. As
gitflow is just a process for managing your branching and merging
features into your mainline branches, no project out there will show
'success' based solely upon using gitflow.

Here is why we use gitflow:

We have 5 developers working on a project at a time.

We release versions of this application to our testing environments
twice a day, and to production every 1-3 days.

Before we started using gitflow, we had deployments to our production
environment hald back due to commits that weren't tested yet, and thus
having no surety that we were good to go to production. Now that we use
gitflow, my developers keep their work in feature branches, can commit
at will, and only merge it back to our develop branch when the feature
is complete. Furthermore, we use 'releases' in git flow as well, so I
can take a snapshot of develop, make changes only to fix what is in a
release, and merge the release back when it is signed off on by the
business. It has allowed us to continue to move VERY quickly, and still
control precisely what is in each build.

The killer feature, for me at least, is the 'hotfix' feature though.
With deploying as often as we do, there are bound to be issues that need
to be fixed right now. using 'git flow hotfix' I get a branch that is
based off of master (production), can make the changes we need, and when
I merge it back, it is automatically merged to both master and develop,
tagged as a release, and I can deploy a build from master immediately.

 Gitflow seems a bit too complicated for my liking. I've been using
Scott Chacon's "GitHub Flow"[0] for over three years, with the added
twist that after the PR has been reviewed and approved, I rebase all of
my commits to a single commit with a descriptive commit log of changes
and a link to a Trello/Basecamp/whatever card for the feature.

 I recently started with a group that uses gitflow. It is my first
experience with it. Thus my experience with it is pretty ignorant.

That said, it seems to be way too heavy weight to me. Especially given
modern DVCS abilities. I literally cannot figure out the advantages of
having a master branch and a development mainline vs just using tags.

Basically it seems to be a workflow with the assumption that branching
is hard, based on a version control system where branching is easy.

TLDR; Ignorant view == skip it.

 We have been using it for a year and had absolutely no problems
whatsoever. We create feature branches for almost everything that
requires more than a single commit. It allows us to check in temporary
breaking changes in our branches, without impacting the work of other
developers.

We use release branch when we have a fixed feature set that we're ready
to deploy.

Hotfixes for live problems that need to be fixed ASAP.

 Yes you should use it. We name feature branches after JIRA tickets for
accountability and transparency. It's made tracking branches and tickets
associated with them super easy and fast.

You've got nothing to lose, it's essentially just a naming convention
for git. You won't be locked into anything.

 We use the idea, but I think most of our team has abandoned the actual
git-flow scripts. We manage our pull requests via Github, so the
git-flow feature finish workflow wasn't being used.

That said, git-flow was a great way to introduce sanity to our
branching. Our designers figured it out very quickly, too.

 Also look at "github flow" which is a slight modification of the
original git flow design:

 I have used git flow for a number of projects (everything from
small-time to enterprise-scale) and it seemed to work just fine, from
what I saw. Just my two cents.

 git-flow is just an easy way to manage your branching. There's nothing
locking you into it, since it's just a branch naming system and
shortcuts for regular old git commands, so you might as well just try
it. I think you'll find it's very nice and easy to work with. If for
some reason you don't like it or it doesn't work for you, you can just
stop using it.
