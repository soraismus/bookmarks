Elliptic Curves as Elementary Equations
=======================================

Posted on [February 10,
2014](http://jeremykun.com/2014/02/10/elliptic-curves-as-elementary-equations/ "10:00 am")
by [Jeremy
Kun](http://jeremykun.com/author/jeremykun/ "View all posts by Jeremy Kun")

Finding solutions to systems of polynomial equations is one of the
oldest and deepest problems in all of mathematics. This is broadly the
domain of algebraic geometry, and mathematicians wield some of the most
sophisticated and abstract tools available to attack these problems.

The elliptic curve straddles the elementary and advanced mathematical
worlds in an interesting way. On one hand, it’s easy to describe in
elementary terms: it’s the set of solutions to a cubic function of two
variables. But despite how simple they seem deep theorems govern their
behavior, and many natural questions about elliptic curves are still
wide open. Since elliptic curves provide us with some of the strongest
and most widely used encryption protocols, understanding elliptic curves
more deeply would give insight into the security (or potential
insecurity) of these protocols.

Our first goal in this series is to treat elliptic curves as
mathematical objects, and derive the *elliptic curve group*as the
primary object of study. We’ll see what “group” means next time, and
afterward we’ll survey some of the vast landscape of unanswered
questions. But this post will be entirely elementary, and will gently
lead into the natural definition of the group structure on an elliptic
curve.

Elliptic Curves as Equations
----------------------------

The simplest way to describe an elliptic curve is as the set of all
solutions to a specific kind of polynomial equation in two real
variables,
![x,y](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "x,y").
Specifically, the equation has the form:

![\\displaystyle y\^2 = x\^3 + ax +
b](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+y%5E2+%3D+x%5E3+%2B+ax+%2B+b&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "\displaystyle y^2 = x^3 + ax + b")

Where
![a,b](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Cb&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "a,b")
are real numbers such that

![\\displaystyle -16(4a\^3 + 27b\^2) \\neq
0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+-16%284a%5E3+%2B+27b%5E2%29+%5Cneq+0&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "\displaystyle -16(4a^3 + 27b^2) \neq 0")

One would naturally ask, “Who the hell came up with *that?*” A thorough
answer requires a convoluted trip through 19th and 20th-century
mathematical history, but it turns out that this is a clever form of a
very natural family of equations. We’ll elaborate on this in another
post, but for now we can give an elementary motivation.

Say you have a pyramid of spheres whose layers are squares, like the one
below

[![pyramid-spheres](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/pyramid-spheres.png?w=1800)](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/pyramid-spheres.png)

We might wonder when it’s the case that we can rearrange these spheres
into a single square. Clearly you can do it for a pyramid of height 1
because a single ball is also a 1×1 square (and one of height zero if
you allow a 0×0 square). But are there any others?

This question turns out to be a question about an elliptic curve. First,
[recall](http://jeremykun.com/2011/06/24/sums-of-the-first-n-numbers-squares/ "Sums of the first n numbers, squares")
that the number of spheres in such a pyramid is given by

![\\displaystyle 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + \\dots + n\^2 =
\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+1+%2B+4+%2B+9+%2B+16+%2B+%5Cdots+%2B+n%5E2+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bn%28n%2B1%29%282n%2B1%29%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "\displaystyle 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + \dots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}")

And so we’re asking if there are any positive integers
![y](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "y")
such that

![\\displaystyle y\^2 =
\\frac{x(x+1)(2x+1)}{6}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+y%5E2+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bx%28x%2B1%29%282x%2B1%29%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "\displaystyle y^2 = \frac{x(x+1)(2x+1)}{6}")

Here is a graph of this equation in the plane. As you admire it, though,
remember that we’re chiefly interested in *integer* solutions.

[![pyramid-ec](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/pyramid-ec1.png?w=1800)](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/pyramid-ec1.png)

The equation doesn’t quite have the special form we mentioned above, but
the reader can rest assured (and we’ll prove it later) that one can
transform our equation into that form without changing the set of
solutions. In the meantime let’s focus on the question: are there any
integer-valued points on this curve besides
![(0,0)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2C0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "(0,0)")
and
![(1,1)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2C1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "(1,1)")?
The method we use to answer this question comes from ancient Greece, and
is due to [Diophantus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantus). The
idea is that we can use the two points we already have to construct a
third point. This method is important because it forms the basis for our
entire study of elliptic curves.

Take the line passing through
![(0,0)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2C0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "(0,0)")
and
![(1,1)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2C1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "(1,1)"),
given by the equation ![y =
x](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "y = x"),
and compute the intersection of this line and the original elliptic
curve. The “intersection” simply means to solve both equations
simultaneously. In this case it’s

![\\begin{aligned} y\^2 &= \\frac{x(x+1)(2x+1)}{6} \\\\ y &= x
\\end{aligned}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D+y%5E2+%26%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bx%28x%2B1%29%282x%2B1%29%7D%7B6%7D+%5C%5C+y+%26%3D+x+%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "\begin{aligned} y^2 &= \frac{x(x+1)(2x+1)}{6} \\ y &= x \end{aligned}")

It’s clear what to do: just substitute the latter in for the former.
That is, solve

![\\displaystyle x\^2 =
\\frac{x(x+1)(2x+1)}{6}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+x%5E2+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bx%28x%2B1%29%282x%2B1%29%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "\displaystyle x^2 = \frac{x(x+1)(2x+1)}{6}")

Rearranging this into a single polynomial and multiplying through by 3
gives

![\\displaystyle x\^3 - \\frac{3x\^2}{2} + \\frac{x}{2} =
0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+x%5E3+-+%5Cfrac%7B3x%5E2%7D%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7Bx%7D%7B2%7D+%3D+0&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "\displaystyle x^3 - \frac{3x^2}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 0")

Factoring cubics happens to be easy, but let’s instead use a different
trick that will come up again later. Let’s use a
[fact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieta's_formulas) that is taught in
elementary algebra and precalculus courses and promptly forgotten, that
the sum of the roots of any polynomial is
![\\frac{-a\_{n-1}}{a\_n}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B-a_%7Bn-1%7D%7D%7Ba_n%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "\frac{-a_{n-1}}{a_n}"),
where
![a\_{n}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%7Bn%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "a_{n}")
is the leading coefficient and
![a\_{n-1}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%7Bn-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "a_{n-1}")
is the next coefficient. Here ![a\_n =
1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_n+%3D+1&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "a_n = 1"),
so the sum of the roots is
![3/2](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%2F2&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "3/2").
This is useful because *we already know two roots,*namely the solutions
0 and 1 we used to define the system of equations in the first place. So
the third root satisfies

![\\displaystyle r + 0 + 1 =
\\frac{3}{2}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+r+%2B+0+%2B+1+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "\displaystyle r + 0 + 1 = \frac{3}{2}")

And it’s ![r =
1/2](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+1%2F2&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "r = 1/2"),
giving the point ![(1/2,
1/2)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2F2%2C+1%2F2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "(1/2, 1/2)")
since the line was
![y=x](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "y=x").
Because of the symmetry of the curve, we also get the point ![(1/2,
-1/2)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2F2%2C+-1%2F2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "(1/2, -1/2)").

Here’s a zoomed-in picture of what we just did to our elliptic curve. We
used the two pink points (which gave us the dashed line) to find the
purple point.

[![line-intersection-example](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/line-intersection-example.png?w=1800)](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/line-intersection-example.png)

The bad news is that these two new points don’t have integer
coordinates. So it doesn’t answer our question. The good news is that
now we have more points! So we can try this trick again to see if it
will give us still more points, and hope to find some that are integer
valued. (It sounds like a hopeless goal, but just hold out a bit
longer). If we try this trick again using ![(1/2,
-1/2)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2F2%2C+-1%2F2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "(1/2, -1/2)")
and
![(1,1)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2C1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "(1,1)"),
we get the equation*\
*

![\\displaystyle (3x - 2)\^2 =
\\frac{x(x+1)(2x+1)}{6}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%283x+-+2%29%5E2+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bx%28x%2B1%29%282x%2B1%29%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "\displaystyle (3x - 2)^2 = \frac{x(x+1)(2x+1)}{6}")

And redoing all the algebraic steps we did before gives us the solution
![x=24,
y=70](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D24%2C+y%3D70&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "x=24, y=70").
In other words, we just proved that

![\\displaystyle 1\^2 + 2\^2 + \\dots + 24\^2 =
70\^2](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+1%5E2+%2B+2%5E2+%2B+%5Cdots+%2B+24%5E2+%3D+70%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "\displaystyle 1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + 24^2 = 70^2")

Great! Here’s another picture showing what we just did.

[![line-intersection-example-2](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/line-intersection-example-2.png?w=1800)](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/line-intersection-example-2.png)

In reality we don’t care about this little puzzle. Its solution might be
a fun distraction (and even more distracting: try to prove there aren’t
any *other* integer solutions), but it’s not the real treasure. The
mathematical gem is the *method* of finding the solution. We can ask the
natural question: if you have two points on an elliptic curve, and you
take the line between those two points, will you *always*get a third
point on the curve?

Certainly the answer is *no*. See this example of two points whose line
is vertical.

[![vertical-line](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/vertical-line.png?w=1800)](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/vertical-line.png)

But with some mathematical elbow grease, we can actually *force* it to
work! That is, we can define things *just right* so that the line
between any two points on an elliptic curve will *always* give you
another point on the curve. This sounds like mysterious black magic, but
it lights the way down a long mathematical corridor of new ideas, and is
required to make sense of using elliptic curves for cryptography.

Shapes of Elliptic Curves
-------------------------

Before we continue, let’s take a little detour to get a good feel for
the shapes of elliptic curves. We have defined elliptic curves by a
special kind of equation (we’ll give it a name in a future post). During
most of our study we won’t be able to make any geometric sense of these
equations. But for now, we can pretend that we’re working over real
numbers and graph these equations in the plane.

Elliptic curves in the form ![y\^2 = x\^3 + ax +
b](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2+%3D+x%5E3+%2B+ax+%2B+b&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "y^2 = x^3 + ax + b")
have a small handful of different shapes that we can see as
![a,b](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Cb&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "a,b")
vary:

[![ECdynamics1](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/ecdynamics1.gif?w=1800)](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/ecdynamics1.gif)[![ECdynamics2](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/ecdynamics2.gif?w=1800)](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/ecdynamics2.gif)

The problem is when we cross the point at which the rounded part pinches
off in the first animation, and the circular component appears in the
second. At those precise moments, the curve becomes “non-smooth” (or
*singular*), and for reasons we’ll see later this is bad. The condition
from the beginning of the article (that ![-16(4a\^3 + 27b\^2) \\neq
0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-16%284a%5E3+%2B+27b%5E2%29+%5Cneq+0&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "-16(4a^3 + 27b^2) \neq 0"))
ensures that these two cases are excluded from consideration, and it’s
one crucial part of our “elbow grease” to ensure that lines behave
nicely.

The “canonical” shape of the elliptic curve is given by the specific
example ![y\^2 = x\^3 - x +
1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2+%3D+x%5E3+-+x+%2B+1&bg=ffffff&fg=36312d&s=0 "y^2 = x^3 - x + 1").
It’s the example that should pop up whenever you imagine an elliptic
curve, and it’s the example we’ll use for all of our pictures.

[![canonical-EC](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/canonical-ec.png?w=1800)](http://jeremykun.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/canonical-ec.png)

So in the next post we’ll roll up our sleeves and see exactly how
“drawing lines” can be turned into an *algebraic structure*on an
elliptic curve.

Until then!

        Unfortunately I’ve never read an entire book on this stuff. I
        occasionally refer to Silverman & Tate’s Rational Points on
        Elliptic Curves, but it’s relatively advanced and only devotes a
        small part to cryptography…

        Elliptic Curves: Number Theory and Cryptography, Lawrence C
        Washington is a really good book. I haven’t read the whole
        thing, but its very accessible and includes detailed proofs and
        chapters on cryptography.

    I believe your expression 3xx-2 should be 3x-2 when solving your

        You’re absolutely right. The odd part is I remember fixing it
        once already

    Nice explanation, thanks! One thing confuses me: why do you need the
    -16 factor in -16(4a\^3+27b\^2) != 0?

        Technical answer: you don’t as long as you’re working in a field
        of characteristic not equal to 2.

        Layman answer: This particular quantity is called the
        discriminant, and the general elliptic curve is usually stated
        simply to have nonzero discriminant. The discriminant gets
        tricky when you pick different number systems (e.g. one in which
        2=0), because then the discriminant is always zero! We’ll talk a
        little bit more about the “general” form of an elliptic curve
        next time, but suffice it to say that you can’t always get your
        elliptic curves to be in this special form.

    Please make your website friendly for those of us who use multiple
    windows – the width of your content is 800 pixels and obscured by
    your menu when the width of my browser is 960. If I maximize my
    browser window it’s equally silly, I can’t see more content at once…
    I just see white (black?) space everywhere. I don’t blame you, I
    blame Web 4.0 or whatever we’re on now – sometimes I pine for lynx.

    You should label your axes.
