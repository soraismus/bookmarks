5-Year-Olds Can Learn Calculus

Why playing with algebraic and calculus concepts—rather than doing
arithmetic drills—may be a better way to introduce children to math

The familiar, hierarchical sequence of math instruction starts with
counting, followed by addition and subtraction, then multiplication and
division. The computational set expands to include bigger and bigger
numbers, and at some point, fractions enter the picture, too. Then in
early adolescence, students are introduced to patterns of numbers and
letters, in the entirely new subject of algebra. A minority of students
then wend their way through geometry, trigonometry and, finally,
calculus, which is considered the pinnacle of high-school-level math.

But this progression actually “has nothing to do with how people think,
how children grow and learn, or how mathematics is built,” says
pioneering math educator and curriculum designer Maria Droujkova. She
echoes a number of voices from around the world that want to
revolutionize the way math is taught, bringing it more in line with
these principles.

The current sequence is merely an entrenched historical accident that
strips much of the fun out of what she describes as the “playful
universe” of mathematics, with its more than 60 top-level disciplines,
and its manifestations in everything from weaving to building, nature,
[music and
art](http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf).
Worse, the standard curriculum starts with arithmetic, which Droujkova
says is much harder for young children than playful activities based on
[supposedly more advanced fields of
mathematics](http://prezi.com/aww2hjfyil0u/math-is-not-linear/).

“Calculations kids are forced to do are often so developmentally
inappropriate, the experience amounts to torture,” she says. They also
miss the essential point—that mathematics is fundamentally about
patterns and structures, rather than “little manipulations of numbers,”
as she puts it. It’s akin to budding filmmakers learning first about
costumes, lighting and other technical aspects, rather than about
crafting meaningful stories.

This turns many children off to math from an early age. It also prevents
many others from learning math as efficiently or deeply as they might
otherwise. Droujkova and her colleagues have noticed that most of the
adults they meet have “math grief stories,” as she describes them. They
recall how a single course—or even [a single topic, such as
fractions—derailed them from the sequential
track](http://www.cehd.umn.edu/ci/rationalnumberproject/). She herself
has watched more than a few grown-ups “burst out crying during
interviews, reliving the anxieties and lost hopes of their young
selves.”

Droujkova, who earned her PhD in math education in the United States
after immigrating here from Ukraine, advocates a more holistic approach
she calls “natural math,” which she teaches to children as young as
toddlers, and their parents. This approach, covered in the book she
co-authored with Yelena McManaman, “[Moebius Noodles: Adventurous math
for the playground crowd](http://www.moebiusnoodles.com),” hinges on
harnessing students’ powerful and surprisingly productive instincts for
playful exploration to guide them on a personal journey through the
subject. Says Droujkova: “Studies [e.g., [this
one](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-835X.1988.tb01095.x/abstract;jsessionid=0763357FD179C89F1D99A66B424D6F07.f02t02),
and many others referenced in [this
symposium](http://www.merga.net.au/documents/MERGA33_Symposium_BobisEtAl.pdf)]
have shown that games or free play are efficient ways for children to
learn, and they enjoy them. They also lead the way into the more
structured and even more creative work of noticing, remixing and
building mathematical patterns.”

[Study: Babies Can't Learn to
Read](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/02/study-babies-cant-learn-to-read/284067/)

Finding an appropriate path hinges on appreciating an often-overlooked
fact—that “the complexity of the idea and the difficulty of doing it are
separate, independent dimensions,” she says. “Unfortunately a lot of
what little children are offered is simple but hard—primitive ideas that
are hard for humans to implement,” because they readily tax the limits
of working memory, attention, precision and other cognitive functions.
Examples of activities that fall into the “simple but hard” quadrant:
Building a trench with a spoon (a military punishment that involves many
small, repetitive tasks, akin to doing 100 two-digit addition problems
on a typical worksheet, as Droujkova points out), or memorizing
multiplication tables as individual facts rather than patterns.

Far better, she says, to start by creating rich and social mathematical
experiences that are complex (allowing them to be taken in many
different directions) yet easy (making them conducive to immediate
play). Activities that fall into this quadrant: building a house with
LEGO blocks, doing origami or snowflake cut-outs, or using a pretend
“function box” that transforms objects (and can also be used in
combination with a second machine to compose functions, or backwards to
invert a function, and so on).

“You can take any branch of mathematics and find things that are both
complex and easy in it,” Droujkova says. “My quest, with several
colleagues around the world, is to take the treasure of mathematics and
find the accessible ways into all of it.”

She started with algebra and calculus, because they’re “pattern-drafter
tools, designer tools, maker tools—they support cool free play.” So
“Moebius Noodles” includes activities such as making fractals (to foster
an appreciation of the ideas of recursion and infinitesimals) and
“mirror books” (mirrors that are taped to each other like the covers of
a book and can be angled in different ways around an object to introduce
the concepts of infinity and transformations). (Another book in this
genre is [“Calculus by and for Young People,” by Don
Cohen](http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Young-People-Ages-Yes/dp/096216741X).)

“It’s not the subject of calculus as formally taught in college,”
Droujkova notes. “But before we get there, we want to have hands-on,
grounded, metaphoric play. At the free play level, you are learning in a
very fundamental way—you really own your concept, mentally, physically,
emotionally, culturally.” This approach “gives you deep roots, so the
canopy of the high abstraction does not wither. What is learned without
play is qualitatively different. It helps with test taking and mundane
exercises, but it does nothing for logical thinking and problem solving.
These things are separate, and you can’t get here from there.”

She doesn’t expect children to be able to solve formal equations at age
five, but that’s okay. “There are levels of understanding,” she says.
“You don’t want to shackle people into a formal understanding too
early.” After the informal level comes the level where students discuss
ideas and notice patterns. Then comes the formal level, where students
can use abstract words, graphs, and formulas. But ideally, a playful
aspect is retained along the entire journey. “This is what
mathematicians do—they play with abstract ideas, but they still play.”

Pushback has come primarily from two very different (and usually
opposing) camps.

Droujkova notes that natural math—whose slogan is “make math your own,
to make your own math”—is essentially a “freedom movement.” She
explains: “We work toward freedom at many levels—the free play of little
kids, the agency of families and local groups in organizing math
activities, the autonomy of artists and makers, and even liberty for us
curriculum designers. … No single piece of mathematics is right for
everyone. People are different, and people need to approach mathematics
differently.”

For example, in a group learning about the properties of rhombuses, an
artistically inclined person might prefer to draw a rhombus, a
programmer might code one, a philosopher might discuss the essence of
rhombi, and an origami master might fold a paper rhombus.

Nor does everyone need to learn any particular piece of mathematics,
aside from what’s essential to function in his or her culture. Many
people live to a ripe and happy old age without knowing calculus, for
example. “At the same time, the world would be better off with a higher
literacy for mathematics, and humanity as a whole needs advanced math to
make it through the next 100 years, because there are pretty complex
problems we’re facing.”

Children need to be exposed to a variety of math styles to find the one
that suits them best. But they also need to see meaningful (to them)
people doing meaningful things with math and enjoying the experience.
[Math circles](http://www.mathcircles.org/), where people help one
another, are growing fast and are one way to achieve this. Math know-how
(activities and examples) “must come with communities of practice that
help newbies make sense of it,” Droujkova says. “One does not work
without the other.”

Regardless, if learning is to be as efficient and deep as possible, it’s
essential that it be done freely. That means [giving children a
voice](http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/02/are-we-taking-our-students-work-seriously-enough/)
in which activities to participate, for how long, and also the level of
mastery they want to achieve. (“This is the biggest clash with
traditional curriculum development,” Droujkova notes.)

Adults must be prepared for those times when a child would rather be
doing something other than the planned activity. Says Droujkova: “The
role of adults is to inspire, by saying things like, ‘Ooh, what a
complex shape—have you noticed the curve is made out of straight lines?’
Provide math connections with whatever kids are doing. This is hard to
do—it requires both pedagogical and math concept knowledge, but it can
be learned. And everyone can easily give general support: ‘How very
interesting, I will investigate more.’ You can then look online, or ask
on [a math circle forum](http://ask.moebiusnoodles.com/), to find out
what it means mathematically.”

It’s also helpful to have a variety of interesting materials on hand and
to be okay with the idea of kids taking breaks as needed. Droujkova has
noticed that in most groups, there are one or two kids do something
else, while the rest do the main activity. (The non-participants still
absorb a surprising amount, she adds.)

Pushback has come primarily from two very different (and usually
opposing) camps. One is the “let kids be kids” cohort, which worries
that legitimizing the idea of involving toddlers with algebra and
calculus will tempt Tiger Mom types to push their kids into formal
abstractions in these subjects at ever younger ages, even though that
would completely miss the point. Other critics fall into the “back to
basics” camp, which contends that all this play will prevent kids from
becoming fluid in traditional calculation skills.

[The Stereotypes That Distort How Americans Teach and Learn
Math](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/the-stereotypes-that-distort-how-americans-teach-and-learn-math/281303/)

Droujkova views these criticisms as indicative of something much bigger:
“They reflect rather deep chasms between different philosophies of
education, or more broadly, differences in the futures we pave for kids.
When we assign a lot of similar exercises, we picture kids in situations
that require industrial precision.” Giving children logic puzzles or
open projects, on the other hand, indicates aspirations of them growing
up to become explorers or designers. “It does not work that directly,”
she concedes, “but these beliefs dictate what mathematics education the
grown-ups select or make for the kids.”

There are also some who worry about whether this approach is practical
for disenfranchised populations. Droujkova says that it can be led by
any “somewhat literate” adult; the key is to have the right support
network in place. She and her colleagues are striving to empower local
networks and enhance accessibility on all fronts: mathematical, cultural
and financial. They have made their materials and courses open under
Creative Commons, and designed activities that require only readily
available materials.

“The know-how about making community-centered, open learning available
to disenfranchised populations is growing,” Droujkova notes, citing
experiments by [Sugata
Mitra](http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_shows_how_kids_teach_themselves.html)
and [Dave Eggers](http://826valencia.org). Online hubs can connect
like-minded community members, and online courses and support are
available to parents, teachers and teenagers who want to lead local
groups.

Droujkova says one of the biggest challenges has been the mindsets of
the grown-ups. Parents are tempted to replay their "bad old days" of
math instruction with their kids, she says. With these calculus and
algebra games, though, “parents say they get a fresh start. … They can
experience the joy of mathematical play anew, like babies in a new
world.”
