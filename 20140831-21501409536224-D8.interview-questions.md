Ant-ics
=======

I was told an example interview question involving ants following one
another around in a square, and it continued to bug me for a while (pun
wholeheartedly intended). The specific wording of the problem is this:

4 ants are place at the corners of a square of unit area, and each ant
walks towards the ant ahead of it. What is the shape of the path the
ants take, and how far do they walk until they meet?

Sounds fun and relatively simple (though not so much in an interview
situation!), lets have a look.

Now, due to the symmetry of the problem we can just focus on one ant as
it follows its neighbour ahead of it – pick the rightmost ant as
depicted below, and assign it polar coordinates
![(r,\\theta)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r%2C%5Ctheta%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "(r,\theta)").
I’ve drawn the starting positions of the 4 ants, and how 2 of them have
moved after a short time, say ![\\Delta
t](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\Delta t").

[![Setup](http://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/setup.png?w=1200)](https://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/setup.png)

We’d need to find the path of the ant, so we need to know how
![r](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "r")
changes as a function of
![\\theta](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\theta").
The direction of motion is always towards the next ant which is moving
in the same way but rotated by
![\\pi/2](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%2F2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi/2"),
so it should be fairly obvious that all 4 ants continue to remain on the
corners of a square as it rotates and shrinks and they gradually meet
each other. The paths should look like a spiral then, and we expect the
ants to meet in the middle.

If we zoom in slightly and add some notation, we can decompose the
displacement vector along the
![r](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "r") and
![\\theta](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\theta")
directions. In this geometry the displacement vector is always at
![pi/4](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=pi%2F4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "pi/4")
from the direction of increasing
![\\theta](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\theta"),
and this stays the same as the ants walk towards one another.

[![Setup\_zoom](http://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/setup_zoom.png?w=1200)](https://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/setup_zoom.png)

Decomposing displacement components then, we have in some small time
period (assuming unit velocity, we’re only concerned in relative
displacements so the velocity doesn’t matter)

![\\Delta r =
-\\cos(\\pi/4)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+r+%3D+-%5Ccos%28%5Cpi%2F4%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "\Delta r = -\cos(\pi/4)")

![r\\Delta \\theta =
\\sin(\\pi/4)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%5CDelta+%5Ctheta+%3D+%5Csin%28%5Cpi%2F4%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "r\Delta \theta = \sin(\pi/4)")

![\\Rightarrow \\frac{\\Delta r}{\\Delta \\theta} =
-r\\frac{\\sin(\\pi/4)}{\\cos(\\pi/4)} =
-r](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CRightarrow+%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta+r%7D%7B%5CDelta+%5Ctheta%7D+%3D+-r%5Cfrac%7B%5Csin%28%5Cpi%2F4%29%7D%7B%5Ccos%28%5Cpi%2F4%29%7D+%3D+-r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "\Rightarrow \frac{\Delta r}{\Delta \theta} = -r\frac{\sin(\pi/4)}{\cos(\pi/4)} = -r").

If we then take the limits ![\\Delta r \\rightarrow
0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+r+%5Crightarrow+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\Delta r \rightarrow 0"),
![\\Delta \\theta \\rightarrow
0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+%5Ctheta+%5Crightarrow+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\Delta \theta \rightarrow 0")
we end up at the nice and simple differential equation

![\\frac{dr}{d\\theta} =
-r](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bdr%7D%7Bd%5Ctheta%7D+%3D+-r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "\frac{dr}{d\theta} = -r")

which I’m sure 9 of 10 people you meet in the street would be able to
solve. We’ve assumed a unit square, so the initial ant radius at
![\\theta =
0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta+%3D+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\theta = 0")
is
![1/\\sqrt{2}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "1/\sqrt{2}"),
and the solution is

![r =
\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}e\^{-\\theta}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7De%5E%7B-%5Ctheta%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}e^{-\theta}")

which is surprisingly simple, and much simpler than had we tried
cartesian coordinates. The setup of the problem is perhaps designed to
encourage a cartesian approach, where I’m sure the poor interviewee
would get quickly bogged down in an awful differential equation to
solve.

It is interesting to note that this is a logarithmic spiral which is
self-similar (another type of fractal?) and occurs throughout nature

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic\_spiral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_spiral)

We can animate the ants now, and its clear that, as we argued, they stay
on the vertices of a square as they spiral inwards.

[![Ants](http://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/ants.gif?w=1200)](https://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/ants.gif)

Finally, to solve the problem and get our job shepherding insects, we
have to work out the path length
![s](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "s").
This is simple now we have all the relevant information, we know we’re
going from ![\\theta =
0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta+%3D+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\theta = 0")
to ![\\theta \\rightarrow
\\infty](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta+%5Crightarrow+%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\theta \rightarrow \infty")
so we just have to perform the integral

![s = \\int\_0\^{\\infty} \\sqrt{r\^2d\\theta\^2 +
dr\^2}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%3D+%5Cint_0%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Csqrt%7Br%5E2d%5Ctheta%5E2+%2B+dr%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "s = \int_0^{\infty} \sqrt{r^2d\theta^2 + dr^2}")

![s = \\int\_0\^{\\infty} \\sqrt{r\^2 +
\\left(\\frac{dr}{d\\theta}\\right)\^2}d\\theta](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%3D+%5Cint_0%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Csqrt%7Br%5E2+%2B+%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bdr%7D%7Bd%5Ctheta%7D%5Cright%29%5E2%7Dd%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "s = \int_0^{\infty} \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2}d\theta")

![s = \\sqrt{2}\\int\_0\^{\\infty} r d\\theta = \\int\_0\^{\\infty}
e\^{-\\theta} d\\theta =
1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%5Cint_0%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+r+d%5Ctheta+%3D+%5Cint_0%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+e%5E%7B-%5Ctheta%7D+d%5Ctheta+%3D+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "s = \sqrt{2}\int_0^{\infty} r d\theta = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\theta} d\theta = 1").

So, after all that we end up, of course, at 1. There are only two
numbers in physics, 1 and
![\\pi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi"),
so in hindsight perhaps it would have been prudent to guess one of these
and bask in our adulation when we were correct. However, this might not
have made for a satisfactory interview and surely a follow-up question
would be inbound imminently. Well, lets prepare for just such an
occasion! We just dealt with the situation of 4 ants on a square, so
naturally we should try and generalise this result. What about regular
triangles, pentagons, circles etc?

Again we can exploit the symmetry of the problem and just focus on one
ant. The only thing that has changed now is the angle the displacement
vector makes with the
increasing-![\\theta](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\theta")
vector:

[![Setup\_zoom\_ngon](http://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/setup_zoom_ngon.png?w=1200)](https://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/setup_zoom_ngon.png)

We’ve assumed a regular N-sided polygon (an N-gon), which means the ants
are distributed round in steps of
![2\\pi/N](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Cpi%2FN&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "2\pi/N"),
i.e. for a square N=4 and the steps are
![\\pi/2](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%2F2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi/2")
as in the previous diagram. The new equations for changes in
![r](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "r") and
![\\theta](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\theta")
are then

![\\Delta r =
-\\cos(\\pi/N)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+r+%3D+-%5Ccos%28%5Cpi%2FN%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "\Delta r = -\cos(\pi/N)")

![r\\Delta \\theta =
\\sin(\\pi/N)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%5CDelta+%5Ctheta+%3D+%5Csin%28%5Cpi%2FN%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "r\Delta \theta = \sin(\pi/N)")

![\\Rightarrow \\frac{\\Delta r}{\\Delta \\theta} =
-r\\frac{\\sin(\\pi/N)}{\\cos(\\pi/N)} \\Rightarrow \\frac{dr}{d\\theta}
=
-r\\tan{\\pi/N}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CRightarrow+%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta+r%7D%7B%5CDelta+%5Ctheta%7D+%3D+-r%5Cfrac%7B%5Csin%28%5Cpi%2FN%29%7D%7B%5Ccos%28%5Cpi%2FN%29%7D+%5CRightarrow+%5Cfrac%7Bdr%7D%7Bd%5Ctheta%7D+%3D+-r%5Ctan%7B%5Cpi%2FN%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "\Rightarrow \frac{\Delta r}{\Delta \theta} = -r\frac{\sin(\pi/N)}{\cos(\pi/N)} \Rightarrow \frac{dr}{d\theta} = -r\tan{\pi/N}")

so

![r =
r\_0e\^{-\\tan(\\pi/N)\\theta}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+r_0e%5E%7B-%5Ctan%28%5Cpi%2FN%29%5Ctheta%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "r = r_0e^{-\tan(\pi/N)\theta}")

for some initial radius
![r\_0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "r_0").
How should we compare these N-gons? If we stick with 1 unit to a side
they will rapidly become much larger than our initial square and the
results won’t be comparable. We’ll stick with the requirement that the
area of the N-gon is 1 unit, which leads to the requirement for
![r\_0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "r_0")
that

![r\_0 =
\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N}\\frac{1}{\\sin(2\\pi/N)}}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_0+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7BN%7D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csin%282%5Cpi%2FN%29%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "r_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2}{N}\frac{1}{\sin(2\pi/N)}}")

so finally the expression for the paths the ants take for our unit area
N-gons becomes

![r =
\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N}\\frac{1}{\\sin(2\\pi/N)}}e\^{-\\tan(\\pi/N)\\theta}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7BN%7D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csin%282%5Cpi%2FN%29%7D%7De%5E%7B-%5Ctan%28%5Cpi%2FN%29%5Ctheta%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "r = \sqrt{\frac{2}{N}\frac{1}{\sin(2\pi/N)}}e^{-\tan(\pi/N)\theta}").

and of course if we set N=4 we recover the previous expression. We can
churn through the same algebra as before to find the path length too

![s\_N = \\int\_0\^{\\infty} \\sqrt{r\^2 +
\\left(\\frac{dr}{d\\theta}\\right)\^2}d\\theta](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_N+%3D+%5Cint_0%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Csqrt%7Br%5E2+%2B+%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bdr%7D%7Bd%5Ctheta%7D%5Cright%29%5E2%7Dd%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "s_N = \int_0^{\infty} \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2}d\theta")

![s\_N = \\int\_0\^{\\infty} r\\sqrt{1 +
\\tan\^2(\\pi/n)}d\\theta](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_N+%3D+%5Cint_0%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+r%5Csqrt%7B1+%2B+%5Ctan%5E2%28%5Cpi%2Fn%29%7Dd%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "s_N = \int_0^{\infty} r\sqrt{1 + \tan^2(\pi/n)}d\theta")

![s\_N = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N}\\frac{1}{\\sin(2\\pi/N)}}\\sqrt{1 +
\\tan\^2(\\pi/N)}\\int\_0\^{\\infty}
e\^{-\\tan(\\pi/N)\\theta}d\\theta](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_N+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7BN%7D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csin%282%5Cpi%2FN%29%7D%7D%5Csqrt%7B1+%2B+%5Ctan%5E2%28%5Cpi%2FN%29%7D%5Cint_0%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+e%5E%7B-%5Ctan%28%5Cpi%2FN%29%5Ctheta%7Dd%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "s_N = \sqrt{\frac{2}{N}\frac{1}{\sin(2\pi/N)}}\sqrt{1 + \tan^2(\pi/N)}\int_0^{\infty} e^{-\tan(\pi/N)\theta}d\theta")

![s\_N =
\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N}\\frac{1}{\\sin(2\\pi/N)}}\\frac{\\sec(\\pi/N)}{\\tan(\\pi/N)}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_N+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7BN%7D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csin%282%5Cpi%2FN%29%7D%7D%5Cfrac%7B%5Csec%28%5Cpi%2FN%29%7D%7B%5Ctan%28%5Cpi%2FN%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "s_N = \sqrt{\frac{2}{N}\frac{1}{\sin(2\pi/N)}}\frac{\sec(\pi/N)}{\tan(\pi/N)}")

![s\_N =
\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N\\sin\^3(\\pi/N)\\cos(\\pi/N)}}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_N+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%5Csin%5E3%28%5Cpi%2FN%29%5Ccos%28%5Cpi%2FN%29%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "s_N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N\sin^3(\pi/N)\cos(\pi/N)}}").

This is a nice and simple formula that, again, reduces to 1 if we select
N=4. We can plot this out to see how it varies, and if we were to allow
noninteger N (whatever that means…) there are actually 2 solutions for a
unit path length.

[![LengthPlot](http://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/lengthplot.png?w=1200)](https://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/lengthplot.png)

There is a minimum between a triangle and square, but it doesn’t occur
at 1 or
![\\pi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi")
so I have no idea how to work that out. Actually its the solution to an
algebraically unsolvable equation, so there’s not much to be learnt
there. As N increases ![s\_N \\rightarrow
N\\pi\^{-3/2}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_N+%5Crightarrow+N%5Cpi%5E%7B-3%2F2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "s_N \rightarrow N\pi^{-3/2}")
and the path length increases without limit. This makes sense, as the
shapes become more and more circular the spirals become more and more
shallow and eventually the poor ants are just wandering around in
circles. At this point in the interview, which I assume is for some kind
of bug exhibit at the zoo, you should of course decry this inhumanity of
the poor ants (inhumantity?) forever walking in circles and storm out.
Not before showing the following fancy animation to prove your newfound
anti-aliasing skills though.

    I think it’s actually more interesting to consider the side length
    to be 1, since that keeps the distance between the ants the same.
    The path length turns out to be 1/(2sin\^2 (π/N)), which does reduce
    to 1 for a square. The radius when the side length is 1 is
    1/(2sin(π/N)), so we also get the result that the path length is
    r/sin(π/N), itself a pretty interesting result. To get a path length
    of 1, you want the radius to be sin(π/N), which means that the area
    is N/2 sin\^2 (π/N) sin(2π/N) = N sin\^3 (π/N) cos (π/N).
    Interestingly, as N gets large, the area gets small as 1/N\^2, which
    means that the spirals get tighter and tighter.
