Mormon missionaries pray before the start of their Mandarin Chinese
class at the Missionary Training Center, in Provo, Utah.

On a sunny Wednesday in Provo, Utah, a long line of cars spits out about
300 new arrivals to the Missionary Training Center. The facility, known
as MTC, is the largest language training school for members of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Every year, about 36,000 students come to the center before they leave
on missions around the world to spread the Mormon faith.

There is a lot of excitement; last year, the church lowered the
missionary age to 18 for men and 19 for women. The mood is like the
move-in day at a college, only all of the students are dressed in dark
suits and modest skirts.

The training center is widely recognized as one of the best
language-instruction institutes in the world, [though that's not the
only thing that's taught](http://www.mtc.byu.edu/themtc.htm). In a
matter of weeks, these enthusiastic young students will be speaking
foreign languages fluently enough to spread the gospel.

**How Do They Do It?**

At 8 a.m., in a small downstairs classroom, 10 missionaries start their
day with a Mormon hymn — in Mandarin. Instructor Bracken Hodges is a
student at Brigham Young University, which is next door. Like most of
the instructors, he's a former missionary (he spent two years in
Taiwan).

"We're working on the grammar structure ... and we're teaching that
grammar structure in the context of teaching someone about Jesus Christ
and what he did when he was on the Earth," Hodges says.

The class recites phrases like, "What did Jesus Christ do when he was on
Earth?"

Once everyone has the pronunciation down, Hodges quizzes individual
students. After that, students pair off for role-playing exercises. One
student plays a missionary, and the other a local — a potential convert.

Megan Jackson, a 26-year-old from Wisconsin, has vocabulary flashcards
pinned to her skirt — a pretty common accessory here. When she arrived
five weeks ago, Jackson had never studied Mandarin.

"I was like a deer in the headlights on the first day, to be honest,"
Jackson says. "But now I can understand like 98 percent of what the
teachers are saying to me. I'm getting more and more excited as the time
goes."

Kirsten Weiss is one of the few students in this class with previous
experience in Mandarin. She studied the language in college but says the
training at the MTC is much more intense.

"The five weeks that I've been at the MTC, I've seen people go from
having zero experience with Mandarin — or even learning any language —
to going where I was maybe about my third year of studying at a
university," Weiss says. "It's very impressive."

Instructor Hodges says the secret is in the unofficial motto of the
training center: "Speak your language." Rather than memorizing a list of
words, students learn through trying to speak their assigned language in
various scenarios. When they stumble in saying a phrase, that's when
they find new words to learn, Hodges says.

**A Novel Approach**

A decade ago, many universities taught languages through rote
memorization and translation. The context-based teaching that the MTC
uses is relatively new in language instruction.

The approach has also gained traction in the U.S. military. In fact, the
ties between the U.S. military and the MTC run pretty deep. The Army's
Intelligence Brigade, made up of linguists, is based in Utah and draws
on former missionaries to fill its ranks.

The military trains soldiers in much the same way the church trains
missionaries; they're not conjugating verbs, they're acting out real
situations.

"I'm not going to give you multiple-choice questions. I'm not going to
give you fill-in-the-blanks," says Betty Lou Leaver, the provost at the
Defense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif. "Instead, we're going to
actually do something. So a task is something you might actually do in
your life."

But there's a difference between training soldiers and training
missionaries. To study Mandarin at the Defense Language Institute takes
64 weeks; missionaries leave the training center after just nine.

Many institutions want to know the secret to that efficiency, not just
the military. The MTC frequently hosts visitors from government,
academia and business.

But there's something that can be hard to replicate outside of the
church. It's the thing that has these young adults smiling and bright as
they spend every waking hour focused on their task.

"Everything we do is trying to learn by and with the Spirit, so that's
really the only way you can ... stand it here," says Benjamin Simpson.

Many other students said the same thing in one way or another — and
whether you share their faith or not, the results speak for themselves.
