[Reactive Programming in JavaScript](http://engineering.silk.co/post/80056130804/reactive-programming-in-javascript)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By: Sebastiaan Visser March 19th 2014

Writing large JavaScript projects is hard. The language lacks both a
type system and a canonical module system, it has a rather clunky syntax
and has a threading model that is, to say the least, interesting. No
wonder so many third party JavaScript frameworks exist. Luckily
JavaScript is a flexible language, which makes extending it easy.

As the Silk client keeps growing, keeping our JavaScript code base clean
has proven to be a bit of a challenge as well. One of the techniques we
use to keep the complexity manageable is **Functional Reactive
Programming** (FRP). Reactive programming allows us to declaratively set
up bindings between data in different parts of our product that keep in
sync automatically. Most dynamic parts of our user interface are
reactively connected to our underlying data model. FRP allows us to
abstract over information that changes over time with minimal effort.

Currently we solely use reactive programming within our client
application. Although not unthinkable (or even uncommon) we have no
reactive connection from the client to the server (yet).

At Silk we developed our own JavaScript library for reactive
programming. The interface is heavily inspired by functional programming
idioms from Haskell. Prototyping the library in a type safe manner in
Haskell gave us great confidence about the expressiveness of the
programming interface.

This post demonstrates how we use reactive programming as part of the
development process of Silk. If you think this stuff is interesting [you
might consider joining us!](http://jobs.silk.co/)

### Reactive Variables

At the basis of our library we can find **reactive variables**, mutable
reference cells containing a value that might change over time. Value
changes within a variable can easily be observed by other reactive
variables, or by listeners that can perform arbitrary side effects.

We illustrate the basic usage of reactive variables below. We create a
variable containing a number and inspect the current value by using the
snapshot method `get`. We can write a new value to the variable with
`set`, after which we can observe a new value. Pretty straightforward so
far.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
// Creating a variable with initial value:
var v = new Reactive(20);

// Snapshot the value using 'get':
console.log("v:", v.get()); // prints 20

// Update the value using 'set':
v.set(10);

console.log("v:", v.get()); // now prints 10
~~~~

Reactive variables can be observed by other reactive variables by
linking them using the `link` method. After linking two variables their
values will keep in sync. Links can be broken with the `unlink` method.
Once a value is linked, so it depends on another value, setting it
manually makes no sense anymore.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
// Create two variables and link one to another:
var a = new Reactive(20);
var b = new Reactive(10);
b.link(a); // b.get()  =>  20

// Setting variable 'a' will now update the value of 'b' as well:
a.set(4);  // b.get()  =>  4

// Unlinking cleans up the connection:
b.unlink();
a.set(3);  // b.get()  => still 4
~~~~

Linking variables one-to-one can be useful, but isn’t the most
interesting of use cases. In the section about composition we’ll see
some combinator functions that link variables in more interesting ways.

### Side Effects

To be able to perform actions when the value of a reactive variables
changes, we can attach listeners. We use the function `onchange` to
register a side effect.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
var myTitle = new Reactive("<untitled>");

// Install the side effect (using ECMAScript 6 lambdas!)
var eff = myTitle.onchange((t) => document.title = t);

// Setting the reactive value will now automatically
// update the document.title as well:
myTitle.set("MyDocument-1");

// ...after a while, when no longer needed:
eff.cleanup();
~~~~

Note that if you set the value of a reactive variable to the value it
already contains, no value propagation will happen and no side effects
will be fired. Side effects only fire when the value changes or during
initialization. The `onchange` method returns a handle that can be used
to cleanup the effect when no longer needed.

The `onchange` method is really only meant to connect a value (or
network of values) to some part of the outside world (like the document
title), not to update other variables. Updating other variables is
better done using `link` or one of the composition combinators described
below.

### Reactive jQuery

As part of our framework we’ve built a small plug-in for jQuery that
allows us to connect reactive variables to the DOM. We extend jQuery
with methods similar to existing jQuery methods, but prefixed with the
letter `r`, indicating their reactive counterparts.

For example, `rText` allows us to connect a reactive string to the text
contents of a DOM element.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
var header = new Reactive("initial string");
$("h1").first().rText(header);

// Setting the reactive value now automatically updates
// the text contents of our header element:
header.set("New Header Text!");
~~~~

Besides `rText`, we have `rHtml`, `rAttr`, `rAddClass`, `rToggle`, and
several variants. Instead of taking normal strings, HTML fragments, or
booleans as input, the reactive counterparts take reactive variables
containing strings, HTML fragments, or booleans as input. When the
values change the DOM will update automatically. Additionally (with the
use of mutation observers) we were even able to build a connection the
other way around: when the DOM updates the connected variables also
update.

Adding more functionality as jQuery plug-ins is easy and can be done
with the use of the `onchange` method. For example, to get the value of
an `<input>` element as a reactive value we could write:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
// Extend jQuery with reactive input field values:
$.fn.rVal =
  function (rv) // reactive variable as input
  {
    var el = this;

    // When the input text changes, update the variable:
    el.on("input", () => rv.set(el.val()));

    // When the variable changes, update the element:
    rv.onchange((v) => el.val(v));

    return el;
  };
~~~~

Now instead of jQuery’s `val` method we can use our own `rVal` method.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
var myValue = new Reactive("");
$("form input").rVal(myValue);

// We can use the variable to interface with the input value:
myValue.set("new value");
~~~~

Why would we want to use reactive variables instead of using jQuery
directly? Because we can easily observe changes and compose them with
other reactive variables!

### Composition Using Lift

Reactive values become interesting when you start composing them,
building up data flow networks that automatically propagate information.
The easiest way of composition in our framework is by lifting regular
JavaScript functions into reactive functions. Reactive functions are
functions that can be applied to reactive values and will return a
reactive variable.

Let’s say we have a JavaScript function to compute the length of the
diagonal of a rectangle, given the width and height. We can make a
reactive function out of this by using `Reactive.lift`.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
var diagonal = Reactive.lift((w, h) => Math.sqrt(w * w + h * h));
~~~~

Now we can apply it to reactive numbers instead of normal JavaScript
numbers and get back a reactive number again.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
// Create a rectangle with reactive properties:
var myRect =
  { width  : new Reactive(20)
  , height : new Reactive(4)
  };

// Put the diagonal on our rectangle as a reactive computation
// over the dimensions:
myRect.diagonal = diagonal(myRect.width, myRect.height);

// Link it to the text of some DOM element:
$("div.diagonal").rText(myRect.diagonal);

// The text on the page will now automatically update when
// changing the dimensions of our rectangle!
myRect.width.set(200);
myRect.height.set(2);
~~~~

The lifted functions will be re-run every time one of the input
variables update. Because it is unclear when the function will run and
even how many times it will run it must be kept **pure**. Side effects
in lifted functions can cause strange and undefined behavior.

In the simple case of lifting a single argument function, we can use the
method `map` available directly on reactive values.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
var numbers = new Reactive("1.0 30e3 20.07 50");

// Create a reactive view on the string as a list of actual
// numbers. Because we lift a one argument function we can
// just use 'map'.
var asList = numbers.map((s) => s.split(/\s+/).map(parseFloat));
~~~~

The `lift` function is probably the mostly used combinator in our
framework, because it allows us to create views on data that will
automatically update when needed. These views are reactive variables as
well, which makes attaching side effects and further composition easy.

Why is the `map` function called `map`?

The functions is called `map` because it corresponds directly to the
Haskell function `fmap`, part of the `Functor` type class. Similarly,
the function `lift` corresponds somewhat to a multi-argument version of
Haskell’s `liftA` (and `liftA2`, `liftA3`, etc) for the `Applicative`
type class. For those with a Haskell background we show the exact
correspondence below.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
// JavaScript:              --  Haskell:

lift(f)(a, b, c)            liftA3 f a b c
lift(f)(a, b, c)            f <$> a <*> b <*> c

// JavaScript:              --  Haskell:

lift(f)(a)                  f <$> a
lift(f)(a)                  fmap f a
a.map(f)                    fmap f a
~~~~

Note that a unary `lift` is equivalent to `map`.

### Nested Reactive Variables

What happens when a function lifted with `lift` itself returns a
reactive variable? The result of lifting will now be a reactive variable
containing as the value another reactive variable. This is most likely
not what you want.

To flatten a nested reactive variable we can use the `join` or `bind`
methods.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
// Say 'v.inner' is reactive, we need 'join' to flatten afterwards:
var flattened = outer.map((v) => v.inner).join();

// Bind is simply a shortcut for 'join' after 'map':
var flattened = outer.bind((v) => v.inner);
~~~~

To illustrate how this is useful we take a small example directly from
the Silk product. In our client we allow users to edit Silk pages, which
are internally called *documents*. Every document contains a list of
properties, like the title, the main article node and some more state
variables. Some of those properties (like the title) are reactive,
because we want an easy way to observe their changes.

The Silk client also has the concept of a *canvas*, an object that can
render Silk documents to the screen. The canvas contains a reactive
variable `activeDocument` which tracks the document currently being
rendered. Updating this property will render a new document.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
// Create a Silk document:
var myDoc = { title : new Reactive("[untitled]")
            , uri   : new Reactive("/page/untitled-document-31")
            , node  : $("<article />")
            , dirty : new Reactive(false)
            }

// Render the document on the canvas by
// setting the 'activeDocument':
Silk.canvas.activeDocument.set(myDoc);
~~~~

Part of the responsibility of the canvas is to keep the text of the
page’s first `<h1>` element in sync with active document’s title. We can
model this as a reactive connection that we set up when constructing the
canvas. The value will be kept in sync during the entire lifetime of the
element.

Because both the active document and the title property are reactive, we
need `bind` to project the title out.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
// The Canvas constructor:
function Canvas (initialDoc)
{
  this.activeDocument = new Reactive(initialDoc);
  this.node           = $("#canvas");

  // Find the header and reactively set the text to
  // the active document's title:
  var title = this.activeDocument.bind(d => d.title);
  $("h1").first().rText(title);
}
~~~~

The `bind` method proves to be very useful here. When we now change the
active document’s title, the header and canvas elements will stay up to
date automatically. Interestingly, when we set a new active document,
the elements will also change and now track the new document. We install
the data bindings only once, during canvas construction. Still, all
changes from now on will be reflected without any additional code!

So, why is `bind` called `bind`?

Again, the function name finds its origin in Haskell. Bind is one of the
primitive methods from Haskell’s `Monad` type class. Reactive variables
form a monad, which means we can flatten nested layers of reactivity
into one.

The correspondence between our JavaScript functions and the Haskell
counterparts is shown below. Note that `join` after `map` is equivalent
to `bind`.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
// JavaScript:              --  Haskell:

a.join()                    join a

a.bind(f)                   a >>= f
a.bind(f)                   do v <- a
                               g v
a.map(f).join()             join (fmap a f)
~~~~

We find `return` (and `pure`) as the constructor for reactive variables:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
// JavaScript:              --  Haskell:

new Reactive(a)             return a
~~~~

### Additional Reactive Combinators

Besides the basic composition operators (`lift`, `map`, `bind`, and
`join`), we have some other combinators that make working with reactive
values worthwhile. To give you an idea what kind of combinators are
possible with a reactive programming library like ours, we list some
interesting functions with an example or their usages.

-   `wait`: Wait for a condition on a reactive value to become true, run
    an action once and unlink immediately after.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
// Alert once when the user signs out:
user.map(authenticated)
    .wait( (isAuth) => !isAuth                    // predicate
         , () => alert("no longer logged in!")    // action
         );
~~~~

-   `sample`: A small combinator to sample changes over some period of
    time.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
// Send a new query string to the server if the string
// representation of our internal data model changes, but
// at most once every 5 seconds:
queryData.map(computeQueryString)
         .sample(5000)
         .onchange(performQueryXHR);
~~~~

-   `collapse`: A bit like `sample`, but runs once at the end of a
    JavaScript thread.

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
// Render the username as the text contents of a <div>,
// but render at most once per thread:
$("div.username").rText(user.bind((u) => u.name).collapse());
~~~~

-   `bimap`: A bit like `map`, but connects two values in both
    directions. We specify two functions, one for every direction. The
    invariant is that both functions need to form a proper isomorphism
    (or at least converge to one).

~~~~ {.sourceCode .javascript}
// Makes sure the 'halved' and 'doubled' variables
// always keep there invariant:
bimap( halved
     , doubled
     , (a) => a * 2
     , (a) => Math.round(a / 2)
     );
~~~~

Like you see here, those reactive combinators allow for a syntactically
lightweight form of asynchronous programming.

### Drawbacks

Even with a few very simple JavaScript types and combinators we are able
to build very powerful data abstractions. The Silk client uses this
reactive paradigm a lot and we can safely say this benefits the quality
of our code base a lot. Unfortunately there are also several drawbacks
to using FRP like this:

-   **Resource management can be tricky.** Every variable you link adds
    a node to the reactive graph, when the link isn’t need anymore you
    need to clean it up again. This requires some form of manual garbage
    collection. Cleaning up automatically is hard, because two linked
    values have a mutual references and JavaScript doesn’t have pointer
    finializers. We managed to build a system that can at least clean up
    intermediate unused parts of reactive networks, so minimal work of
    the library user is required. Also, it must be noted that cleaning
    up resources is equally hard in the case of normal event based
    systems, when using jQuery `on` and `off` for example.

-   **Occasionally care is needed to prevent value oscillation.** When
    two values depend on eachother (with either a direct, or indirect
    cycle) values must converge, otherwise the network will echo value
    changes continuously. Non-converging networks isn’t a widely
    occurring problem, but when it does happen debugging can be painful.

-   **Debugging can be surprising.** Reactive networks a very good at
    propagating data changes through every part of your application. In
    that sense they work a bit like events. Debugging problems with
    reactive values can be tricky because problems in one part of your
    application might be caused by seemingly unrelated pieces of code.
    This needs some getting used to. Like most problems in JavaScript, a
    static type system could greatly benefit us here. We’re are
    currently investigating using TypeScript for parts of our code base
    to improve reasoning about our connections between different parts
    of the product.

### Conclusion

Overall we’re very happy with our framework and would encourage other
client side programmers to the explore the realm of FRP as well.
Especially when building complicated user interfaces that need to keep
up to date with frequent changes in the underlying data model, reactive
data bindings can keep the amount of manual work down.
