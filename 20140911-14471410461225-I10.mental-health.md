Tech Has a Depression Problem
=============================

Start-up founders might seem like they've got it made, but long hours,
isolation, and stress put them at risk of mental illness.

In 2011, a few months into starting Wahooly—a crowdfunding platform in
which backers receive a share in the venture’s success—Dana Severson
started to have bouts of debilitating anxiety. The company had started
off well, but things had plateaued lately. “You see other people getting
press and doing things faster than you and it makes you second guess
every single skill that you have,” he says. But Severson didn’t tell
anybody about his feelings. He couldn’t, he felt, because he had to be a
good leader.

“Theres a lot of money at stake in this world—it's not only the
investors that you need the confidence of, it’s also your co founders
and employees,” he says. “I couldn’t allow them to have any sort of
doubt in my ability to perform.”

After opening up to a friend, Severson learned that he wasn’t alone in
his anxiety, or in his fear of admitting it. Seven months ago, he and
developer Nick Ciske co-founded [Startups
Anonymous](https://startupsanonymous.com/), a forum in which people in
the tech industry can post questions and concerns anonymously and
receive positive feedback.

So far, he says, about half of the submissions have been about anxiety
and depression.

In tech circles, depression is “more prevalent than anyone really talks
about,” Brad Feld, managing director of the venture capital firm Foundry
Group, and co founder of TechStars told me. Building a company involves
long hours, late nights and an enormous amount of stress. The
competitive nature of the startup industry—less than 10 percent of
ventures succeed—discourages people from talking about their problems
and feeds into the myth that successful founders are confident and in
charge at all times.

“The notion that you can be vulnerable, the notion that you can share a
weakness, those are antithetical to the great CEO archetype,” Feld says.

As a result, many founders believe they are struggling alone, and slowly
become isolated from social networks and resources that could
potentially help them recover. Fortunately, some influential players
have started to speak out, including Y Combinator President Sam Altman,
who [wrote an encouraging blog
post](http://blog.samaltman.com/founder-depression) addressed to
founders dealing with depression and anxiety this past June. "Most of
the founders I know have had seriously dark times, and usually felt like
there was no one they could turn to," Altman wrote. "For whatever it’s
worth, you’re not alone, and you shouldn’t be ashamed."

\* \* \*

Depression is hardly exclusive to tech. The disorder is the leading
cause of disability worldwide, according to the World Health
Organization, and costs employers billions of dollars a year in lost
revenue. Multiple people I talked to for this story pointed out that
entertainers are also known for melancholy. For writers and artists,
neuroses are practically required.

Yet certain elements of startup life and culture may make people
particularly susceptible to depression. Stress, uncertainty, youth and
isolation—the virtual cornerstones of today’s startup—have all been
shown to increase likelihood of developing the disorder. Irregular work
hours and constant high stress levels can lead to both social isolation
and sleep disturbances, which can aggravate depression and make people
even more volatile. It’s almost a perfect storm, says Maurice Ohayon, a
professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine. “Any
psychiatrist can tell you that this population is particularly exposed,”
he told me.

"For whatever it’s worth, you’re not alone, and you shouldn’t be
ashamed."

Most founders operate under a huge amount of pressure. They are
responsible for employees, shareholders, and maintaining company morale,
mostly before reaching the age of 30. And especially in the early stages
of running a startup, they shoulder that burden mostly alone.

Two years ago, Patrick Campbell, 27, founded Price Intelligently—a
Boston-based company that helps app developers figure out the optimal
price for their product—and was hit with anxiety early on. “For the
first six months it was literally me in an office trying to make things
happen,” he says. As the only full-time employee he made all the
decisions, and would often stay up late to get everything done. “It
started to eat away at my life.”

Worst of all, he says, there was no break. “It doesn't matter how last
quarter went. Nothing is ever good enough, because there's always
another lead and another target.”

This constant stress is punctuated by moments of sheer panic as founders
have to deal with continuous threats to their fledgling companies. A
woman we’ll call Evelyn, CEO of a startup headquartered in Amsterdam who
asked not to be identified by her real name, says she’s been through
long stretches of moderate depression and recently went through a period
of extreme burnout. After getting word that a sponsor had withdrawn
funding when cash reserves were already dangerously low, she burst into
tears at a conference. “It's very much a roller coaster,” she says.
Sometimes “everything seems to be going as it should, and then there can
be dark patches, and those are the hardest bits to climb out of.”

Ohayon says that this constant roller coaster ride makes founders
especially vulnerable. “They go from one state where they are totally
excited and then to the deepest depression. When you snap like that so
fast from one state to another, the risk of suicide is at a maximum."

\* \* \*

Yet while near failure and extreme lows are a natural part of launching
a startup, talking about these things openly is not. “There's an awful
lot of bluster in the startup world,” says Evelyn. If you ask anyone how
their company is doing, they’ll say “Its going really well, we’re
crushing it,” says Campbell, who has lost multiple friends to suicide.
Mental health problems are “taboo.”

Admitting to depression is “equated with the actual performance of the
company,” Campbell says. It’s stigmatized enough that Evelyn didn’t want
to use her real name, so as not to put her company’s funding at risk.

Entertainers are known for melancholy. For writers and artists, neuroses
are practically required. In tech it's taboo.

There's a building mythology that surrounds startup founders. After
languishing for decades, America has regained its reputation as an
economic force—and it's largely due to the tech industry and innovators
like Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey. Startup founders are, in a way,
our new American heroes—like astronauts and cowboys of yore. As Tom
Wolfe would put it, they're supposed to be made up of "the right
stuff"—an ineffable mix of courage, determination and grit.

In such an intensely competitive environment, where everyone is aspiring
to the top of the pyramid yet only a fraction get funded, “any little
thing” could be your downfall, Severson says.

It’s not necessarily having depression or anxiety themselves that are
unacceptable, Severson says. In fact, internal struggles are often seen
as a “badge of honor.” Even Steve Jobs went through a dark period when
he was kicked out of his own company—but he eventually returned and
brought Apple back from the brink of bankruptcy, revolutionizing
personal computing in the process. The key is that struggling is only
seen as noble if you ultimately come back from it, proving your mettle.

“You’re rewarded for hiding those feelings or overcoming those
feelings,” Campbell says. “Entrepreneurship is all about overcoming.
You’re overcoming the adversity of starting a business and creating
something from nothing. If you can’t overcome yourself it's like what
the hell are you doing?”

As a result, founders find themselves in a bubble where they can’t talk
to anyone about the issues they’re experiencing, says Severson, until
they’ve conquered those feelings. You end up feeling “very alone.”

\* \* \*

Part of being an entrepreneur is putting on a good face for investors,
and the high-pressure, highly competitive culture of startups isn’t
likely to change. But startup depression isn’t insurmountable—as long as
people have strong coping mechanisms in place. Ironically, the same
things that get lost in the whirlwind of running a startup—sleep,
exercise, breaks, social interaction—could be the key to tackling
depression.

“Many of the things that we tell ourselves that we have to do to launch
our business are counterproductive to mental health and wellbeing,” says
Jerry Colonna, a prominent Silicon Alley business coach and former
venture capitalist. “We become convinced that the only way to succeed is
to burn ourselves out to the point that all the things we would have
used to protect ourselves are wiped away.”

Founders are supposed to be made up of "the right stuff"—an ineffable
mix of courage, determination and grit.

Campbell battled with depression and anxiety himself, and says that in
addition to attending a handful of therapy sessions, he was able to
manage it by reprioritizing sleep, diet and exercise. He also benefited
from eventually discussing his problems with friends and business
partners. Campbell’s experience is borne out by the data: Social support
has been shown to be one of the biggest protective factors against
depression.

Startups Anonymous recently received its first suicide note. Severson
and Ciske chose not to put it on the site, but [published a short
excerpt](http://pando.com/2014/08/20/startups-anonymous-how-anonymity-can-save-a-founders-life/).

Severson immediately called the National Suicide Hotline, which
contacted crisis workers in the suicidal founder’s area. The founder
declined to talk to them, but had left his email (something that is
optional on the site) when filling out the post submission form.

Severson messaged him and he responded. After dozens of emails back and
forth it “became more of a discussion” and the situation stopped seeming
so dire, Severson says. “All the person needed was someone to
communicate with. What’s so important is just knowing you’re not alone
and knowing someone can relate to the exact same thing you’re going
through.”

Severson had blogged about having anxiety before, but always
anonymously. His post addressing the suicide note was the first time he
identified himself. “If I can’t put my name behind this then nobody else
is going to either,” he says.
