Diceware passwords now need *six* random words to thwart hackers
================================================================

Five isn't enough anymore because password cracking is frighteningly effective.

One of the best ways to create a random yet memorable password is to use
"[Diceware](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html)." This
involves literally rolling dice and matching the resulting numbers to a
[list](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc) containing
7,776 English words, each identified by a five-digit number. Five
Diceware words has long been thought to provide enough security for the
average user.

A five-word Dice password could be something like
"boseenricoglennlardheath" or "mastkeithhaagquirttulip."

[The secret to online safety: Lies, random characters, *and* a password manager](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/the-secret-to-online-safety-lies-random-characters-and-a-password-manager/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or, how to go from "123456" to "XBapfSDS3EJz4r42vDUt."

But five words is no longer enough, Diceware creator Arnold Reinhold
[wrote](http://diceware.blogspot.com/2014/03/time-to-add-word.html)
earlier this month. Since creating Diceware in 1995 Reinhold had
recommended at least six random words for people "with more stringent
requirements and where the passphrase was being used directly to form a
cryptographic key," but for average users he had said that five would
do.

Now, for average users he recommends "a passphrase with **six** Diceware
words, or five words with one extra character chosen and placed at
random."

"I had previously written that longer Diceware passphrases might be
vulnerable by about 2014," he wrote. "Well it's 2014. Today criminal
gangs probably have access to more computing power then the NSA did when
this page first appeared. So I am upping my passphrase length advice by
one word."

If you have a five-word password today, adding a random character "will
make your passphrase about a thousand time more difficult to crack.
Adding a sixth word makes it 7776 times harder."

Reinhold pointed to cracking capabilities demonstrated by password
expert Jeremi Gosney, whose work is [familiar to Ars
readers](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/).

Even a [GPU cluster from December
2012](http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/12/25-gpu-cluster-cracks-every-standard-windows-password-in-6-hours/)
could, depending on the cryptographic hashing algorithm used to protect
plain-text passwords, cycle through 350 billion guesses per second.
Referring to that project, Reinhold wrote, "They claim they can crack a
random 8-character password in under six hours. At that speed, attacking
a 5-word Diceware passphrase would take on average of 7,300 hours or 10
months to find the correct passphrase, assuming they knew you were using
Diceware and developed equally efficient software designed to try only
valid Diceware words."

Further, he noted that "Criminal gangs have built botnets from thousands
of computers infected with their malware. Marshaling large numbers of
these computers they control might allow them to crack a five word
passphrase in a reasonable amount of time." (Gosney's 25-GPU cluster
attacked the NTLM cryptographic algorithm that Microsoft has included in
every version of Windows since Server 2003. It's known to be much more
vulnerable to cracking than other algorithms. Gosney's machine wouldn't
perform as fast against PBKDF2, for instance.)

**UPDATE**: In a followup e-mail to Ars, Gosney noted that "The figures
are based on a brute-force attack that targets a single hash. Due to the
nature of GPU computing, attacks that combined multiple words are
potentially much slower." At the moment, "Since there are no tools that
currently combine three or more words, we don't really know for sure how
much slower it would be."

In Reinhold's [Diceware
FAQ](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarefaq.html#howlong), he writes
that "Six words may be breakable by an organization with a very large
budget, such as a large country's security agency. Seven words and
longer are unbreakable with any known technology, but may be within the
range of large organizations by around 2030. Eight words should be
completely secure through 2050."

Seven-word Diceware passwords should be considered today for some
high-value systems, such as Bitcoin wallets, he wrote. "I do not claim
to be an expert on Bitcoin, but some Internet searching suggests that
many Bitcoin wallets do very little [key
stretching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching). That and the
fact that wallets are often used to store large sums of money, make them
a very attractive target," he wrote.

Remembering long passwords is hard, especially if you're trying to
remember a lot of them. That's why security experts recommend using a
[password
manager](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/the-secret-to-online-safety-lies-random-characters-and-a-password-manager/),
which generates random passwords for websites you need to log into,
requiring you to only remember one password to unlock the password
management software. Diceware isn't the only method for creating a
strong master password, but if it's the method you prefer, a five-word
password is no longer recommended.
