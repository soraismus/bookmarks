Getting Started with Docker
===========================

-   Posted 2014/03/20

What is Docker?
---------------

Docker is a Container.

While a Virtual Machine is a whole other guest computer running on top
of your host computer (sitting on top of a layer of virtualization),
Docker is an isolated portion of the host computer, sharing the host
kernel (OS) and even its bin/libraries if appropriate.

To put it in an over-simplified way, if I run a CoreOS host server and
have a guest Docker Container based off of Ubuntu, the Docker Container
contains the parts that make Ubuntu different from CoreOS.

This is one of my favorite images which describes the difference:

This image is found on [these
slides](http://www.slideshare.net/dotCloud/docker-intro-november)
provided by Docker.

Getting Docker
--------------

Docker isn't compatible with Macintosh's kernel unless you install
[boot2docker](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/mac/#macosx).
I avoid that and use CoreOS in Vagrant, which comes with Docker
installed.

> I highly recommend [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) as a host machine for
> your play-time with Docker. They are building a lot of [awesome
> tooling](https://coreos.com/using-coreos/) around Docker.

My `Vagrantfile` for CoreOS is as follows:

    config.vm.box = "coreos"
    config.vm.box_url = "http://storage.core-os.net/coreos/amd64-generic/dev-channel/coreos_production_vagrant.box"
    config.vm.network "private_network",
            ip: "172.12.8.150"

If you like NFS, then perhaps use these settings, which share with
CoreOS's writable directory:

    # This will require sudo access when using "vagrant up"
    config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/home/core/share",
        id: "core",
        :nfs => true,
        :mount_options => ['nolock,vers=3,udp']

If you have VMWare instead of Virtualbox:

    config.vm.provider :vmware_fusion do |vb, override|
        override.vm.box_url = "http://storage.core-os.net/coreos/amd64-generic/dev-channel/coreos_production_vagrant_vmware_fusion.box"
    end

And finally, fixing a Vagrant plugin conflict:

    # plugin conflict
    if Vagrant.has_plugin?("vagrant-vbguest") then
        config.vbguest.auto_update = false
    end

If you're **not** using CoreOS, then check out [this
page](https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/) with install instructions
for other flavors of Linux. **Note:** Ubuntu is what Docker develops on,
so that's a safe bet.

> If you are using CoreOS, dont be dismayed when it tries to restart on
> you. It's a "feature", done during auto-updates. You may, however,
> need to run `vagrant reload` to restart the server so Vagrant set up
> file sync and networking again.

Your First Container
--------------------

This is the unfortunate baby-step which everyone needs to take to first
get their feet wet with Docker. This *won't* show what makes Docker
powerful, but it does illustrate some important points.

Docker has a concept of "base containers", which you use to build off
of. After you make changes to a base container, you can save those
change and commit them. You can even push your boxes up to
[index.docker.io](http://index.docker.io).

One of Docker's most basic images is just called "Ubuntu". Let's run an
operation on it.

> If the image is not already downloaded in your system, it will
> download it first from the "Ubuntu repository". Note the use of
> similar terminology to version control systems such as Git.

Run Bash:

    docker run ubuntu /bin/bash

Nothing happened! Well, actually it did. Run `docker ps` (similar to our
familiar Linux `ps`) - you'll see no containers listed, as none are
currently running. Run `docker ps -a`, however, and you'll see an entry!

    CONTAINER ID    IMAGE           COMMAND         CREATED              STATUS      PORTS       NAMES
    8ea31697f021    ubuntu:12.04    /bin/bash       About a minute ago   Exit 0                  loving_pare

So, we can see that docker did run `/bin/bash`, but there wasn't any
running process to keep it alive. **A Docker container only stays alive
as long as there is an active process being run in it**.

Keep that in mind for later. Let's see how we can run Bash and poke
around the Container. This time run:

    docker run -t -i ubuntu /bin/bash

You'll see you are now logged in as user "root" and can poke around the
container!

What's that command doing?

-   `docker run` - Run a container
-   `-t` - Allocate a (pseudo)
    [tty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal)
-   `-i` - Keep stdin open (so we can interact with it)
-   `ubuntu` - use the Ubuntu base image
-   `/bin/bash` - Run the bash shell

Tracking Changes
----------------

Exit out of that shell (`ctrl+d` or type `exit`) and run `docker ps -a`
again. You'll see some more output similar to before:

    CONTAINER ID    IMAGE           COMMAND         CREATED              STATUS      PORTS       NAMES
    30557c9017ec    ubuntu:12.04    /bin/bash       About a minute ago   Exit 127                elegant_pike
    8ea31697f021    ubuntu:12.04    /bin/bash       22 minutes ago       Exit 0                  loving_pare

Copy and paste the most recent Container ID (`30557c9017ec` in my case).
Use that ID and run `docker diff <container id>`. For me, I see:

    core@localhost ~ $ docker diff 30557c9017ec
    A /.bash_history
    C /dev
    A /dev/kmsg

We can see that just by logging into bash, we created a `.bash_history`
file, a `/dev` directory and a `/dev/kmsg` file. Minor changes, but
tracked changes never the less! Docker tracks any changes we make to a
container. In fact, Docker allows us make changes to an image, commit
those changes, and then push those changes out somehwere. **This is the
basis of how we can deploy with Docker.**

Let's install some base items into this Ubuntu install and save it as
our own base image.

    # Get into Bash
    docker run -t -i ubuntu /bin/bash

    # Install some stuff
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y git ack-grep vim curl wget tmux build-essential python-software-properties

Once that finishes running, exit and run `docker ps -a` again. Grab the
latest container ID and run another diff (`docker diff <Container ID>`):

    core@localhost ~ $ docker diff 5d4bdae290a4
    > A TON OF FILE LISTED HERE

There were, of course, lots of new files added. Let's save this version
of our base image so we can use it later. We'll commit these changes,
name this image and tag it in one go. We'll use:
`docker commit <Container ID> <Name>:<Tag>`

    core@localhost ~ $ docker commit 5d4bdae290a4 fideloper/docker-example:0.1
    c07e8dc7ab1b1fbdf2f58c7ff13007bc19aa1288add474ca358d0428bc19dba6  # You'll get a long hash as a Success message

Let's see this image we just created. Run `docker images`:

    core@localhost ~ $ docker images

    REPOSITORY                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE

You'll notice a ton of Ubuntu's here. Since I first used the Ubuntu base
image, it loaded knowledge of the variously tagged versions of Ubuntu
they have available on the [Docker
index](https://index.docker.io/_/ubuntu/).

More excitingly, however, is that we also have our own image
`fideloper/docker-example` and its tag `0.1`!

Building a Server with Dockerfile
---------------------------------

Let's move onto building a static web server with a Dockerfile. The
Dockerfile provides a set of instructions for Docker to run on a
container. This lets us automate installing items - we could have used a
Dockerfile to install git, curl, wget and everything else we installed
above.

Create a new directory and `cd` into it. Because we're installing Nginx,
let's create a default configuration file that we'll use for it.

Create a file called `default` and add:

    server {
        root /var/www;
        index index.html index.htm;

        # Make site accessible from http://localhost/
        server_name localhost;

        location / {
            # First attempt to serve request as file, then
            # as directory, then fall back to index.html
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
        }
    }

That's about as basic as it gets for Nginx.

Next, create a file named `Dockerfile` and add the following, changing
the FROM section as suitable for whatever you named your image:

    FROM fideloper/docker-example:0.1

    RUN echo "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main universe" > /etc/apt/sources.list
    RUN apt-get update
    RUN apt-get -y install nginx

    RUN echo "daemon off;" >> /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    RUN mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
    ADD default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

    EXPOSE 80

    CMD ["nginx"]

What's this doing?

-   `FROM` will tell Docker what image (and tag in this case) to base
    this off of
-   `RUN` will run the given command (as user "root") using
    `sh -c "your-given-command"`
-   `ADD` will copy a file from the host machine into the container
    -   This is handy for configuration files or scripts to run, such as
        a process watcher like supervisord, systemd, upstart, forever
        (etc)

-   `EXPOSE` will expose a port to the host machine. You can expose
    multiple ports like so: `EXPOSE 80 443 8888`
-   `CMD` will run a command (not using `sh -c`). This is usually your
    long-running process. In this case, we're simply starting Nginx.
    -   In production, we'd want something watching the nginx process in
        case it fails

Once that's saved, we can build a new image from this Dockerfile!

    docker build -t nginx-example .

If that works, you'll see `Successfully built 88ff0cf87aba` (your new
container ID will be different).

Check out what you have now, run `docker images`:

    core@localhost ~/webapp $ docker images
    REPOSITORY                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
    nginx-example              latest              88ff0cf87aba        35 seconds ago      468.5 MB
    fideloper/docker-example   0.1                 c07e8dc7ab1b        29 minutes ago      455.1 MB
    ...other Ubuntu images below ...

Also run `docker ps -a`:

    core@localhost ~/webapp $ docker ps -a
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND                CREATED              STATUS    PORTS    NAMES
    de48fa2b142b        8dc0de13d8be            /bin/sh -c #(nop) CM   About a minute ago   Exit 0             cranky_turing
    84c5b21feefc        2eb367d9069c            /bin/sh -c #(nop) EX   About a minute ago   Exit 0             boring_babbage
    3d3ed53987ec        77ca921f5eef            /bin/sh -c #(nop) AD   About a minute ago   Exit 0             sleepy_brattain
    b281b7bf017f        cccba2355de7            /bin/sh -c mkdir /et   About a minute ago   Exit 0             high_heisenberg
    56a84c7687e9        fideloper/docker-e...   /bin/sh -c #(nop) MA   4 minutes ago        Exit 0             backstabbing_turing
    ... other images ...

What you can see here is that **for each line in the Dockerfile, a new
container (and commit sha) is produced** if that line results in a
change to the image used. Similar(ish) to version control! (Also, how
funny is the name "backstabbing\_turing"?)

### Finally, run the web server

Let's run this web server! Use `docker run -p 80:80 -d nginx-example`
(assuming you also named yours "nginx-example" when building it).

> The `-p 80:80` binds the Container's port 80 to the guest machines, so
> if we `curl localhost` or go to the server's IP address in our
> browser, we'll see the results of Nginx processing requests on port 80
> in the container.

    core@localhost ~/webapp $ docker run -d nginx-example
    73750fc2a49f3b7aa7c16c0623703d00463aa67ba22d2108df6f2d37276214cc # Success!

    core@localhost ~/webapp $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND    CREATED          STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
    a085a33093f4        nginx-example:latest   nginx      2 seconds ago    Up 2 seconds   80/tcp    determined_bardeen

Note we ran `docker ps` instead of `docker ps -a` - We're seeing a
currently active and running Docker container. Let's `curl localhost`:

    core@localhost ~/webapp $ curl localhost/index.htmld
    <html>
    <head><title>500 Internal Server Error</title></head>
    <body bgcolor="white">
    <center><h1>500 Internal Server Error</h1></center>
    <hr><center>nginx/1.1.19</center>
    </body>
    </html>

Well, we're sorta there. Nginx is working (woot!) but we're getting a
500 error. That's likely because there's no default `index.html` file
for Nginx to fall back onto. Let's stop this docker instance via
`docker stop <container id>`:

    core@localhost ~/webapp $ docker stop a085a33093f4
    a085a33093f4

To fix this, let's share a directory in between the Container and our
host machine. First, create an `index.html` page from where we'll share
it.

    # I'm going to be sharing the /home/core/share directory on my CoreOS machine
    echo "Hello, Docker fans!" >> /home/core/share/index.html

Then we can start our Docker container again:

    docker run -v /home/core/share:/var/www:rw -p 80:80 -d nginx-example

-   `docker run` - Run a container
-   `-v /path/to/host/dir:/path/to/container/dir:rw` - The volumes to
    share. Note `rw` is read-write. We can also define `ro` for
    "read-only".
-   `-p 80:80` - Bind the host's port 80 to the containers.
-   `-d nginx-example` Run our image `nginx-example`, which has the
    "CMD" setup to run `nginx`

Now run `curl localhost`:

    core@localhost ~/webapp $ curl localhost
    Hello, Docker fans!

...or better yet, point your browser to your server's IP address!

![in browser](https://s3.amazonaws.com/serversforhackers/in-browser.png)

Note that the IP address I used is that of my CoreOS server. I set the
IP address in my `Vagrantfile`. I don't need to know the IP address
given to my Container in such a simple example, altho I can find it by
running `docker inspect <Container ID>`.

    core@localhost ~/webapp $ docker inspect a0b531aa00f4
    [{
        "ID": "a0b531aa00f475b0025d8edce09961077eedd82a190f2e2f862592375cad4dd5",
        "Created": "2014-03-20T22:38:22.452820503Z",
        ... a lot of JSON ...
            "NetworkSettings": {
            "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
            "IPPrefixLen": 16,
            "Gateway": "172.17.42.1",
            "Bridge": "docker0",
            "PortMapping": null,
            "Ports": {
                "80/tcp": [
                    {
                        "HostIp": "0.0.0.0",
                        "HostPort": "80"
                    }
                ]
            }
        },
        ... more JSON ...
    }]

### Linking Containers

Not fully covered here (for now) is the [ability to link two or more
containers](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/use/working_with_links_names/)
together. This is handy if containers need to communicate with
eachother. For example, if your application container needs to
communiate with a database container. Linking lets you have some
infrastrcture be separate from your application.

For example:

Start a container and name it something useful (in this case, `mysql`,
via the `-name` parameter):

    docker run -p 3306:3306 -name mysql -d some-mysql-image

Start your web application container and link it to that container via
`-d name:db` (where `db` is an arbitrary name used in the container's
environment variables):

    docker run -p 80:80 -link mysql:db -d some-application-image

In this example, the `some-application-image` will have environment
variables available such as `DB_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR=172.17.0.8` and
`DB_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT=3306` which you application can use to know the
database location.

> Here's an example of a [MySQL
> Dockerfile](https://github.com/fideloper/docker-mysql)

The Epic Conclusion
-------------------

So, we fairly easily can build servers, add in our application code, and
then ship our working applications off to a server. Everything in the
environment is under your control.

In this way, we can actually **ship the entire environment instead of
just code**.

### P.S. - Tips and Tricks

#### Cleaning Up

If you're like me and make tons of mistakes and don't want the record of
all your broken images and containers lying around, you can clean them
them:

-   To remove a container: `docker rm <Container ID>`
-   To remove all containers: `docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`
-   To remove images: `docker rmi <Container ID>`
-   To remove all images: `docker rmi $(docker ps -a -q)`

> Note: You must remove all containers using an image before deleting
> the image

#### Base Images

I always use [Phusian's Ubuntu base
image](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker). It installs/enables
a lot of items you may not think of, such as the CRON daemon, logrotate,
ssh-server (you want to be able to ssh into your server, right?) and
other important items. Read the Readme file of that project to learn
more.

> Especially note Phusion's use of an "insecure" SSH key to get you
> started with the ability to SSH into your container and play around,
> while it runs another process such as Nginx.

[Orchard](https://orchardup.com/), creators of
[Fig](http://orchardup.github.io/fig/), also have a ton of [great images
to use](https://github.com/orchardup) to learn from. Also, Fig looks
like a really nice way to handle Docker images for development
environments.
