I have a colleague who claims that `git pull` is harmful, and gets upset
whenever someone uses it.

The `git pull` command seems to be the canonical way to update your
local repository. Does using `git pull` create problems? What problems
does it create? Is there a better way to update a git repository?

Or you can just `git pull --rebase` and set this strategy as default for

knoopx has it right, adding `--rebase` flag to `git pull` synchronizes
local with remote then replays your local changes on top of updated
local. Then when you push all you are doing is appending your new
commits to the end of remote. Pretty simple. – [Heath

@RichardHansen, it just seems like a way to cheat the point system,
especially with your answer having such a drastic difference in tone and
such a short time gap. Using your model of Q&A, we could all just ask
questions and answer them ourselves using our previous knowledges. At
that point, you should just consider writing a blog post as that is many
times more appropriate. A Q&A specifically seeks other people's

Summary
-------

By default, `git pull` creates merge commits which add noise and
complexity to the code history. In addition, `pull` makes it easy to not
think about how your changes might be affected by incoming changes.

The `git pull` command is safe so long as it only performs fast-forward
merges. If `git pull` is configured to only do fast-forward merges and a
fast-forward merge isn't possible, then Git will exit with an error.
This will give you an opportunity to study the incoming commits, think
about how they might affect your local commits, and decide the best
course of action (merge, rebase, reset, etc.).

With Git 2.0 and newer, you can run:

        git config --global pull.ff only

to alter the default behavior to only fast-forward. With Git versions
between 1.6.6 and 1.9.x you'll have to get into the habit of typing:

        git pull --ff-only

However, with all versions of Git, I recommend configuring a `git up`
alias like this:

        git config --global alias.up '!git remote update -p; git merge --ff-only @{u}'

and using `git up` instead of `git pull`. I prefer this alias over
`git pull --ff-only` because:

-   it works with all (non-ancient) versions of Git,
-   it fetches all upstream branches (not just the branch you're
    currently working on), and
-   it cleans out old `origin/*` branches that no longer exist upstream.

Problems with `git pull`
------------------------

`git pull` isn't bad if it is used properly. Several recent changes to
Git have made it easier to use `git pull` properly, but unfortunately
the default behavior of a plain `git pull` has several problems:

-   it introduces unnecessary nonlinearities in the history
-   it makes it easy to accidentally reintroduce commits that were
    intentionally rebased out upstream
-   it modifies your working directory in unpredictable ways
-   pausing what you are doing to review someone else's work is annoying
    with `git pull`
-   it makes it hard to correctly rebase onto the remote branch
-   it doesn't clean up branches that were deleted in the remote repo

These problems are described in greater detail below.

### Nonlinear History

By default, the `git pull` command is equivalent to running `git fetch`
followed by `git merge @{u}`. If there are unpushed commits in the local
repository, the merge part of `git pull` creates a merge commit.

There is nothing inherently bad about merge commits, but they can be
dangerous and should be treated with respect:

-   Merge commits are inherently difficult to examine. To understand
    what a merge is doing, you have to understand the differences to all
    parents. A conventional diff doesn't convey this multi-dimensional
    information well. In contrast, a series of normal commits is easy to
    review.
-   Merge conflict resolution is tricky, and mistakes often go
    undetected for a long time because merge commits are difficult to
    review.
-   Merges can quietly supersede the effects of regular commits. The
    code is no longer the sum of incremental commits, leading to
    misunderstandings about what actually changed.
-   Merge commits may disrupt some continuous integration schemes (e.g.,
    auto-build only the first-parent path under the assumed convention
    that second parents point to incomplete works in progress).

Of course there is a time and a place for merges, but understanding when
merges should and should not be used can improve the usefulness of your
repository.

Note that the purpose of Git is to make it easy to share and consume the
evolution of a codebase, not to precisely record history exactly as it
unfolded. (If you disagree, consider the `rebase` command and why it was
created.) The merge commits created by `git pull` do not convey useful
semantics to others—they just say that someone else happened to push to
the repository before you were done with your changes. Why have those
merge commits if they aren't meaningful to others and could be
dangerous?

It is possible to configure `git pull` to rebase instead of merge, but
this also has problems (discussed later). Instead, `git pull` should be
configured to only do fast-forward merges.

### Reintroduction of Rebased-out Commits

Suppose someone rebases a branch and force pushes it. This generally
shouldn't happen, but it's sometimes necessary (e.g., to remove a 50GiB
log file that was accidentally comitted and pushed). The merge done by
`git pull` will merge the new version of the upstream branch into the
old version that still exists in your local repository. If you push the
result, pitch forks and torches will start coming your way.

Some may argue that the real problem is force updates. Yes, it's
generally advisable to avoid force pushes whenever possible, but they
are sometimes unavoidable. Developers must be prepared to deal with
force updates, because they will happen sometimes. This means not
blindly merging in the old commits via an ordinary `git pull`.

### Surprise Working Directory Modifications

There's no way to predict what the working directory or index will look
like until `git pull` is done. There might be merge conflicts that you
have to resolve before you can do anything else, it might introduce a
50GiB log file in your working directory because someone accidentally
pushed it, it might rename a directory you are working in, etc.

`git remote update -p` (or `git fetch --all -p`) allows you to look at
other people's commits before you decide to merge or rebase, allowing
you to form a plan before taking action.

### Difficulty Reviewing Other People's Commits

Suppose you are in the middle of making some changes and someone else
wants you to review some commits they just pushed. `git pull`'s merge
(or rebase) operation modifies the working directory and index, which
means your working directory and index must be clean.

You could use `git stash` and then `git pull`, but what do you do when
you're done reviewing? To get back to where you were you have to undo
the merge created by `git pull` and apply the stash.

`git remote update -p` (or `git fetch --all -p`) doesn't modify the
working directory or index, so it's safe to run at any time—even if you
have staged and/or unstaged changes. You can pause what you're doing and
review someone else's commit without worrying about stashing or
finishing up the commit you're working on. `git pull` doesn't give you
that flexibility.

### Rebasing onto a Remote Branch

A common Git usage pattern is to do a `git pull` to bring in the latest
changes followed by a `git rebase @{u}` to eliminate the merge commit
that `git pull` introduced. It's common enough that Git has some
configuration options to reduce these two steps to a single step by
telling `git pull` to perform a rebase instead of a merge (see the
`branch.<branch>.rebase`, `branch.autosetuprebase`, and `pull.rebase`
options).

Unfortunately, if you have an unpushed merge commit that you want to
preserve (e.g., a commit merging a pushed feature branch into `master`),
neither a rebase-pull (`git pull` with `branch.<branch>.rebase` set to
`true`) nor a merge-pull (the default `git pull` behavior) followed by a
rebase will work. This is because `git rebase` eliminates merges (it
linearizes the DAG) without the `--preserve-merges` option. The
rebase-pull operation can't be configured to preserve merges, and a
merge-pull followed by a `git rebase -p @{u}` won't eliminate the merge
caused by the merge-pull. **Update:** Git v1.8.5 added
`git pull --rebase=preserve` and `git config pull.rebase preserve`.
These cause `git pull` to do `git rebase --preserve-merges` after
fetching the upstream commits. (Thanks to
[funkaster](https://stackoverflow.com/users/985627/funkaster) for the
heads-up!)

### Cleaning Up Deleted Branches

`git pull` doesn't prune remote tracking branches corresponding to
branches that were deleted from the remote repository. For example, if
someone deletes branch `foo` from the remote repo, you'll still see
`origin/foo`.

This leads to users accidentally resurrecting killed branches because
they think they're still active.

A Better Alternative: Use `git up` instead of `git pull`
--------------------------------------------------------

Instead of `git pull`, I recommend creating and using the following
`git up` alias:

    git config --global alias.up '!git remote update -p; git merge --ff-only @{u}'

This alias downloads all of the latest commits from all upstream
branches (pruning the dead branches) and tries to fast-forward the local
branch to the latest commit on the upstream branch. If successful, then
there were no local commits, so there was no risk of merge conflict. The
fast-forward will fail if there are local (unpushed) commits, giving you
an opportunity to review the upstream commits before taking action.

This still modifies your working directory in unpredictable ways, but
only if you don't have any local changes. Unlike `git pull`, `git up`
will never drop you to a prompt expecting you to fix a merge conflict.

### Another Option: `git pull --ff-only --all -p`

The following is an alternative to the above `git up` alias:

    git config --global alias.up 'pull --ff-only --all -p'

This version of `git up` has the same behavior as the previous `git up`
alias, except:

-   the error message is a bit more cryptic if your local branch isn't
    configured with an upstream branch
-   it relies on an undocumented feature (the `-p` argument, which is
    passed to `fetch`) that may change in future versions of Git

### If you are running Git 2.0 or newer

With Git 2.0 and newer you can configure `git pull` to only do
fast-forward merges by default:

    git config --global pull.ff only

This causes `git pull` to act like `git pull --ff-only`, but it still
doesn't fetch all upstream commits or clean out old `origin/*` branches
so I still prefer `git up`.

@brianz: `git remote update -p` is equivalent to `git fetch --all -p`.
I'm in the habit of typing `git remote update -p` because once upon a
time `fetch` didn't have the `-p` option. Regarding the leading `!`, see
the description of `alias.*` in `git help config`. It says, "If the
alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation point, it will be
treated as a shell command." – [Richard

Some of the reasons sound like "pull can cause problems when others do
crazy stuff". No, it's crazy stuff like rebasing a commit out of an
upstream repo that causes problems. IMO rebase is only safe when you do
it locally on a commit that hasn't been pushed yet. Like, for example,
when you pull before you push, rebasing local commits helps keep your
history linear (though linear history isn't that big of a deal). Still,
`git up` sounds like an interesting alternative. –

Most of your points are because you are doing something wrong: you are
trying to review code **in your own working branch**. That's not a good
idea, just create a new branch, pull --rebase=preserve and then toss
that branch (or merge it if you want). –

@funkaster's point here makes a lot of sense, especially re: "Difficulty
Reviewing Other People's Commits". This is not the review flow most Git
users use, it's something I've never seen recommended anywhere and it is
the cause all of the unnecessary extra work described below the heading,
not `git pull`. – [Ben](/users/69697/ben "4752 reputation") Mar 12 at

My answer, pulled from the discussion that
[arose](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7385087) on HackerNews:

I feel tempted to just answer the question using the Betteridge Law of
Headlines: Why is `git pull` considered harmful? It isn't.

-   Nonlinearities aren't intrinsically bad. If they represent the
    actual history they are ok.
-   Accidental reintroduction of commits **rebased** upstream is the
    result of wrongly rewriting history upstream. You can't rewrite
    history when history is replicated along several repos.
-   Modifying the working directory is an expected result; of debatable
    usefulness, namely in the face of the behaviour of
    hg/monotone/darcs/other\_dvcs\_predating\_git, but again not
    intrinsically bad.
-   Pausing to review others' work is needed for a merge, and is again
    an expected behaviour on git pull. If you do not want to merge, you
    should use git fetch. Again, this is an idiosyncrasy of git in
    comparison with previous popular dvcs, but it is expected behaviour
    and not intrinsically bad.
-   Making it hard to rebase against a remote branch is good. Don't
    rewrite history unless you absolutely need to. I can't for the life
    of me understand this pursuit of a (fake) linear history
-   Not cleaning up branches is good. Each repo knows what it wants to
    hold. Git has no notion of master-slave relationships.

I agree. There's nothing inherently harmful about `git pull`. However,
it might conflict with some harmful practices, like wanting to rewrite
history more than is strictly necessary. But git is flexible, so if you
want to use it in a different way, by all means do so. But that's
because *you* (well, @Richard Hansen) want to do something unusual in
git, and not because `git pull` is harmful. –

My issue with `git pull` without the `--rebase` option is the direction
of merge it creates. When you look at the diff, all of the changes in
that merge now belong to the person who pulled, rather than the person
who made the changes. I like a workflow where merging is reserved for
two separate branches (A -\> B) so the merge commit is clear what was
introduced, and rebasing is reserved to getting up-to-date on the same
branch (remote A -\> local A) –

So, perhaps the real question is - how does one protect ones self from
bad practices? It would be awesome to have the default "get my repo in
sync with the other one" to list conflicts (history and source) and
provide straight-forward ways to resolve the same. –

It's not considered harmful if you are using Git correctly. I see how it
affects you negatively given your use case, but you can avoid problems
simply by not modifying shared history.

To elaborate on this: If everyone works on their own branch (which in my
opinion is the proper way to use git), `git pull` isn't any kind of
issue. Branching in git is cheap. –

The accepted answer claims

> The rebase-pull operation can't be configured to preserve merges

but as of [Git
1.8.5](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/1.8.5.txt),
which postdates that answer, you can do

    git pull --rebase=preserve

or

    git config --global pull.rebase preserve

or

    git config branch.<name>.rebase preserve

The [docs](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config.html) say

> When `preserve,` also pass `--preserve-merges` along to 'git rebase'
> so that locally committed merge commits will not be flattened by
> running 'git pull'.

This previous discussion has more detailed information and diagrams:
[git pull --rebase
--preserve-merges](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21364636/git-pull-rebase-preserve-merges).
It also explains why `git pull --rebase=preserve` is not the same as
`git pull --rebase --preserve-merges`, which doesn't do the right thing.

This other previous discussion explains what the preserve-merges variant
of rebase actually does, and how it is a lot more complex than a regular
rebase: [What exactly does git's "rebase --preserve-merges" do (and
why?)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15915430/what-exactly-does-gits-rebase-preserve-merges-do-and-why)
