Retooling vocational education

FOR decades vocational education has suffered from the twin curses of
low status and limited innovation. Politicians have equated higher
education with traditional universities of the sort that they themselves
attended. Parents have steered children away from “shop class”. And
vocational studies have been left to languish: the detritus of an
industrial era rather than the handmaiden of a new economy.

A recent report from a management consultancy, McKinsey, called
“Education to Employment: Getting Europe’s Youth into Work”, paints a
dismal picture of the state of vocational education. In four of the
seven countries surveyed, more than half of young people taking an
academic course said they would have preferred a vocational one. But
they had been put off by disorganisation and lack of prestige. Britain
has more than 20,000 vocational qualifications offered by 150 different
bodies. In America responsibility is scattered among government
departments.

The great exception to this has always been Germany, of course. But now
there are signs that other countries are trying to turn a back road into
an *A**utobahn*. Politicians are banging the drum for vocational
education. Australia, for example, has created a Workforce and
Productivity Agency. Educational innovators are flooding into the
vocational market.

There are good reasons why vocational education should be gaining
ground. The world is plagued by youth unemployment. In the EU about a
quarter of 15- to 25-year-olds are jobless. The figure is lower in
America (15%) but still remarkably high for a country that once prided
itself on having full employment and a flexible labour market. At the
same time firms complain bitterly about skills shortages: 27% of
European employers surveyed by McKinsey said they have left a vacancy
open in the past year because they cannot find anyone with the right
attributes; a third said that lack of skills is causing big problems for
their business.

The university bubble is also beginning to burst. Democratising
universities has proved an expensive and inefficient way of providing
mass higher education. Americans, who led the way, have taken on more
than $1 trillion in student debt. But a growing number think that they
got poor value for money—taught by PhD students not professors, forced
to subsidise expensive research programmes and administrative cadres,
and provided, at the end of it all, with a college diploma that no
longer automatically brings a desirable job.

Frustration with the status quo is at last leading to a burst of
innovation. The internet is well suited to vocational education: it
helps reduce costs while making it easier to earn a living while doing
some vocational training. Just as important is the birth of a new
concept of what is being delivered.

“Competency-based education” sounds tedious but reverses most of the
basic tenets of academic teaching. It tries to transmit mastery of
work-related skills (or “competences”) rather than command of a
particular academic discipline. It is designed for a world of lifelong
learning rather than the “three or four years and you’re done”
university system. Knowledge is broken up into bite-sized “modules”.
Students take these modules at their own convenience—over months or
years, in the evenings or by attending full-time courses—and combine
them in whatever way makes the most sense for their careers. Evaluation
is continuous as students master different skills, rather than embodied
in a single degree certificate: your CV provides a constantly updated
summary of the skills that you have acquired.

This mixture of new technology and different methods of teaching is
attracting a host of entrants, from universities looking for customers
to innovators hoping to create new businesses. Southern New Hampshire
University College of America paved the way by offering competency-based
degrees for $2,500 a year. Other early adopters include the University
of Wisconsin’s UW Flex and Capella University’s FlexPath. Udacity, an
online-education firm, has teamed up with companies such as AT&T to
provide “nano-degrees”: job-related qualifications that can be completed
in six to 12 months for $200 a month. Dev Bootcamp offers a nine-week
course for code developers paid for partly by a success fee. The firm
charges employers for each graduate hired, after they complete 100 days
on the job, and at the same time reimburses students a significant
portion of their tuition fees.

Vocation, vocation, vocation

In a new e-book Clayton Christensen, of Harvard Business School, and
Michelle Weise, of the Christensen Institute, argue that this presages a
revolution: students will be able to take courses that provide them with
essential skills quickly and cheaply. The great disrupter of higher
education will not be MOOCs (massive online open courses), they insist:
these mostly focus on delivering standard academic education over the
internet and suffer from drop-out rates of up to 95%. Rather, it will be
a new approach to learning which makes plenty of use of the internet but
ties education more closely to work. The emphasis on competences rather
than subjects will make vocational education better suited to
post-industrial economies. It will also challenge the dominance of
universities as students realise that they no longer have to amass huge
debts in order to acquire marketable skills.

Mr Christensen and Ms Weise may be going too far when they claim that
disruption will spread throughout the university system. There will
still be a place for academic study and small classes. But vocational
innovation will certainly produce a more dynamic educational
marketplace—and one, moreover, that provides an honoured position for
vocational colleges, rather than treating them as an embarrassing
sideshow.
