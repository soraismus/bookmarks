Testing Asynchronous JavaScript
===============================

*There seems to be a common misconception in the JavaScript community
that testing asynchronous code requires a different approach than
testing ‘regular’ synchronous code. In this post I’ll explain why that’s
not generally the case. I’ll highlight the difference between testing a
unit of code which supports async behavior, as opposed code which is
inherently asynchronous. I’ll also show how promise-based async code
lends itself to clean and succinct unit tests which can be tested in a
clear, readable way while still validating async behaviour.*

Async-compatible code vs. Intrinsically async code
--------------------------------------------------

Most ‘asynchronous’ code which we write as JavaScript developers is not
intrinsically asynchronous. For example, let’s look at a simple ajax
operation implemented using JQuery:

~~~~ {.code .js}
var callback = function(){
  alert('I was called back asynchronously');
};

$.ajax({ 
  type: 'GET', 
  url: 'http://example.com', 
  done: callback 
});
~~~~

You might look at that and say "that's asynchronous code". It has a
callback, right? Actually it's not inherently asynchronous, it just
supports the *potential* to be used in an async context. Because
`$.ajax` provides the result of the AJAX call to its caller via
callbacks rather than by using a return value (or exception) it is able
to implement its operations asynchronously, but in fact it could choose
not to. Imagine this fake version of `$.ajax`:

~~~~ {.code .js}
function ajax( opts ){
  opts.done( "fake result" );
}
~~~~

This is obviously not a complete XHR implementation ;) but more
importantly it is also *not an asynchronous implementation*. By calling
the `done` callback directly from within the method implementation
itself we're flattening a potentially asynchronous operation into a
fully synchronous operation. What effect would that have on clients of
`ajax`? If we called our fake ajax method like this:

~~~~ {.code .js}
console.log( 'calling ajax...' );
ajax({ 
  done: function(){ console.log( 'callback called' ); } 
});
console.log( '...called ajax' );
~~~~

What we'd see would be output along the lines of:

~~~~ {.code .js}
calling ajax...
callback called
...called ajax
~~~~

As you can see, our log entries are written in the order they were
defined, because the fake `ajax` function we're using is a synchronous
implementation of a *potentially* async API. All of this code will be
executed by the runtime synchronously, in a single turn through the
event loop [[1]](#footnote-be-async).

Another way to think about this is that method calls which operate
synchronously are a special case of the more general asynchronous case.
Synchronous code is just async code where the result is returned within
the context of the originating call.

* * * * *

Testing async-supporting code
-----------------------------

Hopefully I have succeeded in demonstrating that most of the JavaScript
code we write isn't inherently async, it just supports async behaviour
because it calls async-capable APIs - those that use callbacks (or
promises). But why should we care about this? The code we write will
always be used in an async context, right? Well, no, not when we want to
write unit tests for our async-supporting code.

Let's continue with an example using `$.ajax`. Imagine we're writing a
function that fetches a JSON description of the current user from a URL
and creates a local User object based on that JSON. Our implementation
might look something like this:

~~~~ {.code .js}
function parseUserJson(userJson) {
  return {
    loggedIn: true,
    fullName: userJson.firstName + " " + userJson.lastName
  };
};

function fetchCurrentUser(callback) {
  function ajaxDone(userJson) {
    var user = parseUserJson(userJson);
    callback(user);
  };

  return $.ajax({
    type: 'GET',
    url: "http://example.com/currentUser",
    done: ajaxDone
  });
};
~~~~

In `fetchCurrentUser` we initiate a GET request to a url, supplying an
`ajaxDone` callback which will be executed asynchronously once the
request comes back with a response. In that callback we take the JSON we
got back from the response, parse it using the `parseUserJson` function
to create a (rather anemic) User domain object. Finally, we call the
callback that was initially passed in to `fetchCurrentUser`, passing the
user object as a parameter.

Let's look at how we would we write a unit test for this code (there is
a list of the tools and libraries used during testing at the bottom of
this post). For example, how would we test that `fetchCurrentUser`
parses JSON into the appropriate User object? Before realizing the
distinction between intrinsically async code and async-supporting code
we might think that we need some sort of asynchronous unit test to test
this asynchronous code. But now we understand that the code we're
testing isn't inherently async. We can flatten its execution into a
synchronous flow for testing purposes. Let's see what that might look
like:

~~~~ {.code .js}
describe('fetchCurrentUser', function() {
    var simulatedAjaxResponse = {
      firstName: "Tomas",
      lastName: "Jakobsen"
    };

    $.ajax = function(ajaxOpts) {
      var doneCallback = ajaxOpts.done;
      doneCallback(simulatedAjaxResponse);
    };

    function fetchCallback(user) {
      expect(user.fullName).to.equal("Tomas Jakobsen");
    };

    fetchCurrentUser(fetchCallback);
  });
});
~~~~

The first thing we do is to replace `$.ajax` with a stub function which
allows us to simulate an ajax response coming back (messing with
`$.ajax` directly is pretty gross, but I don't want to get into
dependency management in this particular post so we'll hold our nose).
We then invoke the `fetchCurrentUser` function which is the subject of
our test. Because `fetchCurrentUser` needs to support async fetching it
takes a callback. Our goal in this test is to inspect the eventual
result of calling `fetchCurrentUser`, which means we need to provide a
callback to it which will receive the user object which is eventually
created. That callback uses [Chai's expect-style
assertions](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/) to verify that the user's
`fullName` property has been initialized correctly.

It's important to note that this test will execute in a totally
synchronous fashion. Just as with our previous example it will complete
within a single turn of the event loop.

* * * * *

The catch
---------

There is a catch with this testing approach. What happens if we
accidentally comment out an important line in our production code like
so:

~~~~ {.code .js}
function fetchCurrentUser(callback) {
  function ajaxDone(userJson) {
    var user = parseUserJson(userJson);
    //callback(user);
  };

  return $.ajax({
    type: 'GET',
    url: "http://example.com/currentUser",
    done: ajaxDone
  });
};
~~~~

This function as it stands won't work correctly. It'll never call the
callback passed in to `fetchCurrentUser`, meaning no user object will
ever be returned. You'd expect that our test would verify this, since
it's explicitly checking the value of the user's `fullName` property.

However, that's not the case. The test will continue to pass. Why is
that? Well, we put our assertions inside the callback which is *never
executed*! The bug means that parts of our test are never called and
thus never exercised.

A naive approach to solving this might look something like:

~~~~ {.code .js}
describe('fetchCurrentUser', function() {
  it('creates a parsed user', function() {
    var simulatedAjaxResponse = {
      firstName: "Tomas",
      lastName: "Jakobsen"
    };

    $.ajax = function(ajaxOpts) {
      var doneCallback = ajaxOpts.done;
      doneCallback(simulatedAjaxResponse);
    };

    function fetchCallback(user) {
      expect(user.fullName).to.equal("Tomas Jakobsen");
      callbackCalled = true;
    };

    var callbackCalled = false;

    fetchCurrentUser(fetchCallback);

    expect(callbackCalled).to.be.true;
  });
});
~~~~

This is the same test as before, except now we're also tracking whether
the callback was ever called. This test will now correctly detect that
our callback is not being exercised and will fail, but it's a bit
clunky. If we're using [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) as
our test runner (as opposed to
[Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) for example) then we have a
slightly better option:

~~~~ {.code .js}
describe('fetchCurrentUser', function() {
  it('creates a parsed user', function(done) {
    var simulatedAjaxResponse = {
      firstName: "Tomas",
      lastName: "Jakobsen"
    };

    $.ajax = function(ajaxOpts) {
      var doneCallback = ajaxOpts.done;
      doneCallback(simulatedAjaxResponse);
    };

    function fetchCallback(user) {
      expect(user.fullName).to.equal("Tomas Jakobsen");
      done();
    };

    fetchCurrentUser(fetchCallback);
  });
});
~~~~

Note that our `it` block now takes a `done` parameter. If Mocha sees
that your `it` block expects a parameter then it will treat the test as
an async test. It will provide a `done` function to your test, and in
return your test is *required* to call `done()` to tell Mocha that the
test is complete. The call to `done()` is our test marking the end of
its control flow. This means that Mocha is able to detect whether a test
reached the end of its control flow, and fail the test if that doesn't
happen. Note this also means your tests can be truly asynchronous if
required and execute through multiple turns of the run loop.

This simple way of explicitly indicating when callback-centric test code
has concluded is one reason why some people to prefer Mocha over
Jasmine. Jasmine does support async tests too, but the mechanism is
considerably clunkier than the `done()` function.

* * * * *

Good, but not great
-------------------

OK, so we've seen that it's very possible to write unit tests for
callback-oriented async-supporting code. However I'll be the first to
admit that the tests aren't very easy to read. It feels like there's a
lot of plumbing code, and the callback-centric nature of the code leaks
into our tests. I consider this a classic case of our tests helping
inform us of a 'code smell'. If the tests look bad or are hard to write
then there's probably something wrong with the way the code under test
was designed.

Next up I'll argue that switching from callbacks to Promises will help
us reduce this code smell, leading to cleaner code with correspondingly
pleasant tests.

* * * * *

A whirlwind introduction to Promises
------------------------------------

I'm going to switch from callback-oriented async code to
promise-oriented for the rest of this article. I find that Promises lead
to an implementation which models the control flow of async-supporting
code in a declarative way. Likewise I think Promises make it easier to
reason about unit tests for async-supporting code. I'll give a very
brief overview of Promises here. If you haven't used them before then I
strongly recommend learning more about them as a first step towards
using them to improve your own async code.

I like to think of Promises as an object-oriented version of callbacks,
with some bonus features tacked on. With traditional callback-oriented
code when you call an async function you pass in a callback which will
be invoked once the async operation completes. In that one function call
you are both asking for some async work to be performed and also
specifying what's next to do once the work is complete. With Promises
the request for an async operation is broken apart from what to do
afterwards. You invoke the async operation as before, but the caller
does not provide a callback as an argument to the async function.
Instead, the async function *returns* a Promise object to the caller.
The caller then registers a callback onto that Promise. You call the
function to invoke the async operation, and then you separately say what
you want to do after the operation completes by interacting with the
Promise which the function returns.

So instead of this callback-oriented code:

~~~~ {.code .js}
var callback = function(){
  alert('I was called back asynchronously');
};

someAsyncFunction( "some", "args", callback );
~~~~

you would do this with promise-oriented code:

~~~~ {.code .js}
var callback = function(){
  alert('I was called back asynchronously');
};

var promise = someAsyncFunction( "some", "args" );
promise.done( callback );
~~~~

In most cases you would use jQuery-style method chaining and anonymous
functions, resulting in something like:

~~~~ {.code .js}
someAsyncFunction( "some", "args" ).done( function(){
    alert('I was called back asynchronously');
  });
~~~~

That's just the very basic functionality that a Promise library provides
- there's a lot more to take advantage of. I covered Promises in a bit
more detail in a [previous blog
post](http://blog.thepete.net/blog/2011/07/02/javascript-promises/). I'd
encourage you to read that for more information. That post also includes
a more complex example which shows how some of the more advanced
features of a Promise library can help remove some of the tedious async
plumbing from your code, helping keep the focus on the actual problem
being solved.

Dominic Denicola also does a great job of explaining why Promises are so
useful in [this
post](http://domenic.me/2012/10/14/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/).
Highly recommended reading.

* * * * *

Porting our async code to promises
----------------------------------

In our previous example we had the following callback-oriented
implementation:

~~~~ {.code .js}
function parseUserJson(userJson) {
  return {
    loggedIn: true,
    fullName: userJson.firstName + " " + userJson.lastName
  };
};

function fetchCurrentUser(callback) {
  function ajaxDone(userJson) {
    var user = parseUserJson(userJson);
    callback(user);
  };

  return $.ajax({
    type: 'GET',
    url: "http://example.com/currentUser",
    done: ajaxDone
  });
};
~~~~

Here's what a promise-oriented implementation would look like:

~~~~ {.code .js}
function parseUserJson(userJson) {
  return {
    loggedIn: true,
    fullName: userJson.firstName + " " + userJson.lastName
  };
};

function fetchCurrentUser() {
  return Q.when($.ajax({
    type: 'GET',
    url: "http://example.com/currentUser"
  })).then(parseUserJson);
};
~~~~

As before `fetchCurrentUser` initiates a GET request to a url, but
rather than passing a callback directly to the `$.ajax` function we
instead take the promise returned from that function and chain the
`parseUserJson` function onto it. In this way we arrange for the JSON
response coming from the `$.ajax` call to flow through to our parser
function - where it is transformed into a parsed User object - and then
continue to flow through to whatever further promise pipeline had been
set up by the caller to `fetchCurrentUser`.

Note that I'm using the excellent [Q
library](http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/) to enhance the
less-than-perfect `$.Deferred` promise implementation that JQuery will
return from the `$.ajax(...)` call. The [post from
Dominic](http://domenic.me/2012/10/14/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/)
which I referenced earlier also discusses what's missing from
`$.Deferred` in more detail.

I find this promise-oriented implementation easier to read than the
callback-oriented code, and by replacing the primitive callbacks with a
promise object the options for extending how it works are much greater.
We can take the promise returned from something like `$.ajax` and then
build upon it to construct a pipeline of operations which operate on a
value, transforming it as it moves through the pipeline.

The tests for this promise-oriented implementation should also
illustrate that it leads to more readable code:

~~~~ {.code .js}
describe('fetchCurrentUser', function() {
  it('creates a parsed user', function(done) {
    var simulatedAjaxResponse = {
      firstName: "Tomas",
      lastName: "Jakobsen"
    };
    $.ajax = function(){ return Q(simulatedAjaxResponse); }

    var userPromise = fetchCurrentUser();

    userPromise.then(function(user) {
      expect(user.fullName).to.equal("Tomas Jakobsen");
      done();
    });
  });
});
~~~~

This test is conceptually identical to the callback-oriented test we had
before. We replace `$.ajax` with a fake implementation that just returns
a hardcoded simulated response, wrapped in a pre-resolved Q promise.
Then we call the `fetchCurrentUser` function. Finally we verify that
what comes out the other end of our promise pipeline has the appropriate
`.fullName` property.

I'd argue that this promise-oriented form is easier to read, and easier
to refactor. There's more though! Because promises act as an
encapsulation of an async operation we can also enhance our test runner
with nice libraries like
[chai-as-promised](https://github.com/domenic/chai-as-promised/) which
will let us refactor our test code into:

~~~~ {.code .js}
describe('fetchCurrentUser', function() {
  it('creates a parsed user', function(done) {
    var simulatedAjaxResponse = {
      firstName: "Tomas",
      lastName: "Jakobsen"
    };
    $.ajax = function(){ return Q(simulatedAjaxResponse); }

    var fetchResult = fetchCurrentUser();

    return expect( fetchResult ).to.eventually
      .have.property('fullName','Tomas Jakobsen')
      .notify(done);
  });
});
~~~~

We can take this further. With the addition of
[mocha-as-promised](https://github.com/domenic/mocha-as-promised) we no
longer need to explicitly tell Mocha when our test's control flow has
concluded:

~~~~ {.code .js}
describe('fetchCurrentUser', function() {
  it('creates a parsed user', function() {
    var simulatedAjaxResponse = {
      firstName: "Tomas",
      lastName: "Jakobsen"
    };
    $.ajax = function(){ return Q(simulatedAjaxResponse); }

    var fetchResult = fetchCurrentUser();

    return expect( fetchResult ).to.eventually
      .have.property('fullName','Tomas Jakobse');
  });
});
~~~~

Here we've gotten rid of the `done` function trick. Instead we pass the
promise chain that represents the asynchronous control flow of our test
*back to the Mocha test runner*, where the mocha-as-promised extensions
are able to do the background plumbing of making sure that the promise
chain concludes before moving on to the next test. This is such a smart
feature that it comes built in to other test runners such as Buster.

This is a good example of why promises are so powerful. By reifying the
concept of async control flow we can actually pass the control flow back
to the test runner where it can then operate on that control flow
directly. Crucially, our tests don't really need to know what the
framework is doing. They just pass the control flow back to the caller
and let it take over.

Essentially promises allow us to separate the concern of invoking an
operation from the concern of handling the result of that operation.
That means we can have our test code simulate one half and test how our
production code handles the other half.

* * * * *

Testing inherently async code
-----------------------------

I've illustrated that we can test async-supporting code in an
essentially synchronous way, but what if you want to test code that
really is inherently async?

Mocha's support for async testing means that it *is* very possible to
test truly asynchronous code using the same techniques I've been showing
for testing async-supporting code in a synchronous way. However, it's
actually rare for 'normal' JavaScript code to be inherently async.
Inherently async means code which explicitly abandons its turn around
the event loop - for example by calling `setTimeout` - or code which
calls a native non-blocking API such as `XMLHttpRequest`. How often do
we write code that does that directly? Not often I'd
say[[2]](#footnote-promises-plus-spec). We *integrate* with code that
does that in the form of libraries like JQuery, but as I've demonstrated
in this post we can still test that integration in a synchronous way
since that integration code is not inherently async.

Aggressively limit the number of truly asynchronous tests you write and
maintain

I would assert that there are few cases where you need to unit test
inherently async code, unless you are writing a low-level library. You
may need to test code that rubs up against libraries that are inherently
async, but you won't often be creating that sort of code yourself, and
thus won't often find a need to write tests for that sort of code. In
fact, my advice is to aggressively limit the number of truly
asynchronous tests you write and maintain. Martin Fowler's [excellent
article on non-deterministic
tests](http://martinfowler.com/articles/nonDeterminism.html) does a
thorough job of explaining why these types of tests tend to be
detrimental to the overall health of your test suite.

If you *do* find yourself writing significant portions of inherently
async code then it's likely you need to take a step back and identify a
small, containable area of your code which handles all that icky async
stuff. It's code that's hard to write and hard to test. Isolate it, and
test the snot out of it with a different type of test (i.e. an
integration test). Gerald Meszaros's documentation of the [Humble Object
pattern](http://xunitpatterns.com/Humble%20Object.html) provides a nice
explanation of some ways to isolate your truely async code in a clean
way. Another wonderful source of advice on testing and containing this
sort of tricky code is [the GOOS
book](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/), which talks
about testing of asynchronous code at various levels in some detail.

At the end of the day I'd guess that most JavaScript 'unit tests' which
*need* async functionality are in fact higher-level integration tests
which are calling out to databases, the DOM, web APIs, etc. Those sort
of tests are good and valuable, but it's important to understand that
they're a different type of test and that you'll almost certainly get
better value from a larger suite of more isolated unit tests. But that's
a post for another day.

Colophon: tools and libraries used
----------------------------------

In my code examples I used the [Q
promises](http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/) implementation. For
testing I used the [Mocha test
runner](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) paired with the [Chai test
assertion library](http://chaijs.com/). I enhanced this testing setup
with the
[mocha-as-promised](https://github.com/domenic/mocha-as-promised) and
[chai-as-promised](https://github.com/domenic/chai-as-promised/)
libraries. I ran the tests on [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), using
[npm](https://npmjs.org/) to declare and install the tools and libraries
mentioned above.

All test code was isolated from any need for a DOM to be present and
also didn't require JQuery (since we always replaced `$.ajax` with a
test double).

Footnotes
---------

### 1: be consistently async

There is a strong argument that even if you *can* resolve an async
operation inline you should still preserve a consistent call sequence by
deferring your response to a subsequent turn around the event loop (see
the next footnote for more on that!) Deferring execution of a callback
is usually achieved using
[`setImmediate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.setImmediate)
or similar.

### 2: Promises/A+ spec compliance

I'm sneakily glossing over the fact that a promises implementation that
complies with
[Promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/) - such as
Q - is
[required](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/#point-39) to
NOT resolve within [a single turn of the event
loop](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/#point-61).

If you don't know what that means, don't worry about it too much. If you
do, then forgive me for not going down that rat hole. I'd argue that
conceptually promised-oriented code is still flattened out to a
synchronous order even if it completes in two turns rather than one.
