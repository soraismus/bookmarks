    Comments](#comments "Comment on Writing A Better JavaScript Library For The DOM")

Advertisement

At present, jQuery is the *de facto* library for working with the
document object model (DOM). It can be used with popular client-side
MV\* frameworks (such as Backbone), and it has a ton of plugins and a
very large community. As developers’ interest in JavaScript increases by
the minute, a lot of people are becoming curious about **how native APIs
really work** and about when we can just use them instead of including
an extra library.

Lately, I have started to see more and more problems with jQuery, at
least my use of it. Most of the problems are with jQuery’s core and
can’t be fixed without breaking backwards compatibility — which is very
important. I, like many others, continued using the library for a while,
navigating all of the pesky quirks every day.

Then, [Daniel Buchner](https://twitter.com/csuwildcat "Daniel Buchner")
created
[SelectorListener](https://github.com/csuwildcat/SelectorListener "SelectorListener"),
and **the idea of “live extensions”** manifested. I started to think
about creating a set of functions that would enable us to build
unobtrusive DOM components using a better approach than what we have
used so far. The objective was to review existing APIs and solutions and
to build a clearer, testable and lightweight library.

### Adding Useful Features To The Library

The idea of live extensions encouraged me to develop the [better-dom
project](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom "the better-dom project"),
although other interesting features make the library unique. Let’s
review them quickly:

-   live extensions
-   native animations
-   embedded microtemplating
-   internationalization support

#### Live Extensions

jQuery has a concept called “live events.” Drawing on the idea of event
delegation, it enables developers to handle existing and future
elements. But more flexibility is required in a lot of cases. For
example, delegated events fall short when the DOM needs to be mutated in
order to initialize a widget. Hence, live extensions.

**The goal is to define an extension once** and have any future elements
run through the initialization function, regardless of the widget’s
complexity. This is important because it enables us to write Web pages
declaratively; so, it works great with AJAX applications.

[![Live extensions make is easier to handle any future
elements.](http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/new-feature-with-jquery.jpg)]()\
*Live extensions enable you to handle any future elements without the
need to invoke the initialization function. ([Image

Let’s look at a simple example. Let’s say **our task is to implement a
fully customizable tooltip.** The `:hover` pseudo-selector won’t help us
here because the position of the tooltip changes with the mouse cursor.
Event delegation doesn’t fit well either; listening to `mouseover` and
`mouseleave` for all elements in the document tree is very expensive.
Live extensions to the rescue!

    DOM.extend("[title]", {
      constructor: function() {
        var tooltip = DOM.create("span.custom-title");

        // set the title's textContent and hide it initially
        tooltip.set("textContent", this.get("title")).hide();

        this
          // remove legacy title
          .set("title", null)
          // store reference for quicker access
          .data("tooltip", tooltip)
          // register event handlers
          .on("mouseenter", this.onMouseEnter, ["clientX", "clientY"])
          .on("mouseleave", this.onMouseLeave)
          // insert the title element into DOM
          .append(tooltip);
      },
      onMouseEnter: function(x, y) {
        this.data("tooltip").style({left: x, top: y}).show();
      },
      onMouseLeave: function() {
        this.data("tooltip").hide();
      }
    });

We can style the `.custom-title` element in CSS:

    .custom-title {
      position: fixed; /* required */
      border: 1px solid #faebcc;
      background: #faf8f0;
    }

The most interesting part happens when you insert a new element with a
`title` attribute in the page. The custom tooltip will work **without
any initialization** call.

Live extensions are self-contained; thus, they don’t require you to
invoke an initialization function in order to work with future content.
So, they can be combined with any DOM library and will simplify your
application logic by separating the UI code into many small independent
pieces.

Last but not least, a few words on [Web
components](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/ "Web Components"). A
section of the specification,
“[Decorators](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/#decorator-section "Decorators"),”
aims to solve a similar problem. Currently, it uses a markup-based
implementation with a special syntax for attaching event listeners to
child elements. But it’s still an early draft:

> “Decorators, unlike other parts of Web Components, do not have a
> specification yet.”

#### Native Animations

[Thanks to
Apple](http://www.apple.com/html5/showcase/transitions/ "Thanks to Apple"),
CSS has [good animation
support](http://caniuse.com/#search=animation "good animation support in CSS")
now. In the past, animations were usually implemented in JavaScript via
`setInterval` and `setTimeout`. It was a cool feature — but now it’s
more like a bad practice. Native animations will always be smoother:
They are usually faster, take less energy and degrade well if not
supported by the browser.

In better-dom, there is no `animate` method: just `show`, `hide` and
`toggle`. To capture a hidden element state in CSS, the library uses the
standards-based `aria-hidden` attribute.

To illustrate how it works, **let’s add a simple animation effect** to
the custom tooltip that we introduced earlier:

    .custom-title {
      position: fixed; /* required */
      border: 1px solid #faebcc;
      background: #faf8f0;
      /* animation code */
      opacity: 1;
      -webkit-transition: opacity 0.5s;
      transition: opacity 0.5s;
    }

    .custom-title[aria-hidden=true] {
      opacity: 0;
    }

Internally, `show()` and `hide()` set the `aria-hidden` attribute value
to be `false` and `true`. It enables the CSS to handle the animations
and transitions.

You can see a demo with [more animation examples that use
better-dom](http://jsfiddle.net/C3WeM/5/ "more animation examples using better-dom").

#### Embedded Microtemplating

HTML strings are annoyingly verbose. Looking for a replacement, I found
the excellent
[Emmet](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/26/goodbye-zen-coding-hello-emmet/ "emmet project").
Today, Emmet is quite a popular plugin for text editors, and it has a
nice and compact syntax. Take this HTML:

    body.append("<ul><li class='list-item'></li><li class='list-item'></li><li class='list-item'></li></ul>");

And compare it to the equivalent microtemplate:

    body.append("ul>li.list-item*3");

In better-dom, any method that accepts HTML may use Emmet expressions as
well. The [abbreviation parser is
fast](http://jsperf.com/dom-create-vs-jquery/18 "The abbreviation parser is fast"),
so no need to worry about a performance penalty. A template
[precompilation
function](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom/wiki/Microtemplating#where-to-use "precompilation function")
also exists to be used on demand.

#### Internationalization Support

Developing a UI widget often requires localization — not an easy task.
Over the years, many have tackled this in different ways. With
better-dom, I believe that **changing the state of a CSS selector is
like switching languages**.

Conceptually speaking, switching a language is like changing the
“representation” of content. In CSS2, several pseudo-selectors help to
describe such a model: `:lang` and `:before`. Take the code below:

    [data-i18n="hello"]:before {
      content: "Hello Maksim!";
    }

    [data-i18n="hello"]:lang(ru):before {
      content: "Привет Максим!";
    }

The trick is simple: The value of the `content` property changes
according to the current language, which is determined by the `lang`
attribute of the `html` element. By using data attributes such as
`data-i18n`, we can maintain the textual content in HTML:

    [data-i18n]:before {
      content: attr(data-i18n);
    }

    [data-i18n="Hello Maksim!"]:lang(ru):before {
      content: "Привет Максим!";
    }

Of course, such CSS isn’t exactly attractive, so better-dom has two
helpers: `i18n` and `DOM.importStrings`. The first is used to update the
`data-i18n` attribute with the appropriate value, and the second
localizes strings for a particular language.

    label.i18n("Hello Maksim!");
    // the label displays "Hello Maksim!"
    DOM.importStrings("ru",  "Hello Maksim!", "Привет Максим!");
    // now if the page is set to ru language,
    // the label will display "Привет Максим!"
    label.set("lang", "ru");
    // now the label will display "Привет Максим!"
    // despite the web page's language

Parameterized strings can be used as well. Just add `${param}` variables
to a key string:

    label.i18n("Hello ${user}!", {user: "Maksim"});
    // the label will display "Hello Maksim!"

### Making Native APIs More Elegant

Generally, we want to stick to standards. But sometimes the standards
aren’t exactly user-friendly. **The DOM is a total mess**, and to make
it bearable, we have to wrap it in a convenient API. Despite all of the
improvements made by open-source libraries, some parts could still be
done better:

-   getter and setter,
-   event handling,
-   functional methods support.

#### Getter and Setter

The native DOM has the **concept of attributes and properties of
elements** that could behave differently. Assume we have the markup
below on a Web page:

    <a href="/chemerisuk/better-dom" id="foo" data-test="test">better-dom</a>

To explain why “the DOM is a total mess,” let’s look at this:

    var link = document.getElementById("foo");

    link.href; // => "https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom"
    link.getAttribute("href"); // => "/chemerisuk/better-dom"
    link["data-test"]; // => undefined
    link.getAttribute("data-test"); // => "test"

    link.href = "abc";
    link.href; // => "https://github.com/abc"
    link.getAttribute("href"); // => "abc"

An attribute value is equal to the appropriate string in HTML, while the
element property with the same name could have some special behavior,
such as generating the fully qualified URL in the listing above. These
differences can be confusing.

In practice, it’s hard to imagine a practical situation in which such a
distinction would be useful. Moreover, the developer should always keep
in mind which value (attribute or property) is being used that
introduces unnecessary complexity.

In better-dom, things are clearer. **Every element has only smart
getters and setters.**

    var link = DOM.find("#foo");

    link.get("href"); // => "https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom"
    link.set("href", "abc");
    link.get("href"); // => "https://github.com/abc"
    link.get("data-attr"); // => "test"

In the first step, it does a property lookup, and if it’s defined, then
it’s used for manipulation. Otherwise, getter and setter work with the
appropriate attribute of the element. For booleans (checked, selected,
etc.), you could just use `true` or `false` to update the value:
Changing such a property on an element would trigger the appropriate
attribute (native behavior) to be updated.

#### Improved Event Handling

Event handling is a big part of the DOM, however, I’ve discovered one
fundamental problem: Having an event object in element listeners forces
a developer who cares about testability to mock the first argument, or
to create an extra function that passes only event properties used in
the handler.

    var button = document.getElementById("foo");

    button.addEventListener("click", function(e) {
      handleButtonClick(e.button);
    }, false);

This is really annoying. What if we extracted the changing part as an
argument? This would allow us to get rid of the extra function:

    var button = DOM.find("#foo");

    button.on("click", handleButtonClick, ["button"]);

By default, the event handler passes the
`["target", "defaultPrevented"]` array, so no need to add the last
argument to get access to these properties:

    button.on("click", function(target, canceled) {
      // handle button click here
    });

**Late binding is supported as well** (I’d recommend reading [Peter
Michaux’s review of the
topic](http://michaux.ca/articles/our-backwards-dom-event-libraries "an article on the topic")).
It’s a more flexible alternative to the regular event handlers that
[exist in the W3C’s
standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-EventListener-handleEvent "exists in the W3C standard").
It could be useful when you need frequent `on` and `off` method calls.

    button._handleButtonClick = function() { alert("click!"); };

    button.on("click", "_handleButtonClick");
    button.fire("click"); // shows "clicked" message
    button._handleButtonClick = null;
    button.fire("click"); // shows nothing

Last but not least, better-dom has none of the shortcuts that exist in
legacy APIs and that behave inconsistently across browsers, like
`click()`, `focus()` and `submit()`. The only way to call them is to use
the `fire` method, which executes the default action when no listener
has returned `false`:

    link.fire("click"); // clicks on the link
    link.on("click", function() { return false; });
    link.fire("click"); // triggers the handler above but doesn't do a click

#### Functional Methods Support

ES5 standardized a couple of useful methods for arrays, including `map`,
`filter` and `some`. They allow us to use common collection operations
in a standards-based way. As a result, today we have projects like
[Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/ "underscore") and
[Lo-Dash](http://lodash.com/ "lodash"), which polyfill these methods for
old browsers.

Each element (or collection) in better-dom has the methods below built
in:

-   `each` (which differs from `forEach` by returning `this` instead of
    `undefined`)
-   `some`
-   `every`
-   `map`
-   `filter`
-   `reduce[Right]`

<!-- -->

    var urls, activeLi, linkText; 

    urls = menu.findAll("a").map(function(el) {
      return el.get("href");
    });
    activeLi = menu.children().filter(function(el) {
      return el.hasClass("active");
    });
    linkText = menu.children().reduce(function(memo, el) {
      return memo || el.hasClass("active") && el.find("a").get()
    }, false);

### Avoiding jQuery Problems

Most of the following issues can’t be fixed in jQuery without breaking
backwards compatibility. That’s why creating a new library seemed like
the logical way out.

-   the “magical” `$` function
-   the value of the `[]` operator
-   issues with `return false`
-   `find` and `findAll`

#### The “Magical” $ Function

Everyone has heard at some point that the `$` (dollar) function is kind
of like magic. A single-character name is not very descriptive, so it
looks like a built-in language operator. That’s why inexperienced
developers call it inline everywhere.

Behind the scenes, **the dollar is quite a complex function**. Executing
it too often, especially in frequent events such as `mousemove` and
`scroll`, could cause poor UI performance.

Despite so many articles recommending jQuery objects to be cached,
developers continue to insert the dollar function inline, because the
library’s syntax encourages them to use this coding style.

Another issue with the dollar function is that it allows us to do two
completely different things. People have gotten used to such a syntax,
but it’s a bad practice of a function design in general:

    $("a"); // => searches all elements that match “a” selector
    $("<a>"); // => creates a <a> element with jQuery wrapper

**In better-dom, several methods cover the responsibilities of the
dollar function** in jQuery: `find[All]` and `DOM.create`. `find[All]`
is used to search element(s) according to the CSS selector. `DOM.create`
makes a new elements tree in memory. Their names make it very clear what
they are responsible for.

#### Value of the [] Operator

Another reason for the problem of frequent dollar function calls is the
brackets operator. When a new jQuery object is created, all associated
nodes are stored in numeric properties. But note that the value of such
a property contains a native element instance (not a jQuery wrapper):

    var links = $("a");

    links[0].on("click", function() { ... }); // throws an error
    $(links[0]).on("click", function() { ... }); // works fine

Because of such a feature, every functional method in jQuery or another
library (like Underscore) requires the current element to be wrapped
with `$()` inside of a callback function. Therefore, developers must
always keep in mind the type of object they are working with — a native
element or a wrapper — despite the fact that they are using a library to
work with the DOM.

In better-dom, the brackets operator returns a library’s object, so
developers can forget about native elements. There is only one
acceptable way to access them: by using a special `legacy` method.

    var foo = DOM.find("#foo");

    foo.legacy(function(node) {
      // use Hammer library to bind a swipe listener
      Hammer(node).on("swipe", function(e) {
        // handle swipe gesture here
      }); 
    });

In reality, this method is required in very rare cases, such as to be
compatible with a native function or with another DOM library (like
[Hammer](http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/ "Hammer") in the example
above).

#### Issues With return false

One thing that really blows my mind is the strange `return false`
interception in jQuery’s event handlers. According to the W3C’s
standards, it should [in most
cases](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-dt-cancelable-event "in most cases")
cancel the default behavior. In jQuery, `return false` also [stops event
delegation](http://api.jquery.com/on/#event-handler "stops event delegation").

Such interception creates problems:

1.  Invoking `stopPropagation()` by itself could lead to compatibility
    problems, because it prevents listeners that are related to some
    other task from doing their work.
2.  Most developers (even experienced ones) are not aware of such
    behavior.

It’s unclear why the jQuery community decided to go cross-standards. But
better-dom is not going to repeat the same mistake. Thus, `return false`
in an event handler *only* prevents the browser’s default action,
without messing with event propagation, as everyone would expect.

#### find and findAll

Element search is **one of the most expensive operations** in the
browser. Two native methods could be used to implement it:
`querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`. The difference is that the first
one stops searching on the first match.

This feature enables us to decrease the iterations count dramatically in
certain cases. In my tests, the [speed was up to 20 times
faster](http://jsperf.com/dom-find-all-vs-jquery-find/3 "speed improvement could be up to 20x")!
Also, you can expect that the improvement will grow according to the
size of the document tree.

jQuery has a `find` method that uses `querySelectorAll` for general
cases. Currently, no function uses `querySelector` to fetch only the
first matched element.

The better-dom library has two separate methods: `find` and `findAll`.
They allow us to use `querySelector` optimization. To estimate the
potential improvement in performance, I searched for the usage of these
methods in all of the source code of my last commercial project:

-   `find`\
     103 matches across 11 files
-   `findAll`\
     14 matches across 4 files

The `find` method is definitely much more popular. It means that
`querySelector` optimization makes sense in most use cases and could
give a major performance boost.

### Conclusion

Live extensions really make solving front-end problems much easier.
Splitting the UI in many small pieces leads to more independent and
maintainable solutions. But as we’ve shown, a framework is not only
about them (although it is the main goal).

One thing I’ve learned in the development process is that if you don’t
like a standard or you have a different opinion of how things should
work, then **just implement it and prove that your approach works**.
It’s really fun, too!

    I think there are a lot of good ideas and fixes in your library.
    Some problems you mentioned with jQuery like the $ function and the
    [] operator are for the most part only problems if you don’t know
    how to use them. I’m not saying it’s good, but I won’t call it a
    problem either as developing code shouldn’t be for dummies anyway.

    The biggest advantage I see in your library is “find” vs “findAll”
    and internationalization support.\
     Currently I have only big projects I’m working on but as soon as a
    smaller one comes up, I’ll give your library a try.

    Thanks for the nice write-up.

        Hardly jQuery would be abandoned in the near future, hence it’s
        viable to suggest findOne method for them.

    I do not understand why do you overwrite the default behaviour of
    aria-hidden=true and set it to display block. Why do you not toggle
    the other way round and set the css transform property on
    aria-hidden=false?

        The problem is that CSS3 animations do not work if an element
        changes the “display” property from “none” to something else. In
        better-dom before 1.6.6, that was published recently, I added
        display:none by default for each element with
        [aria-hidden=true], so I had to overwrite it manually. But good
        news is that starting from 1.6.6 the library uses visibility
        property with a completely different approach (compare
        [http://jsfiddle.net/C3WeM/4/](http://jsfiddle.net/C3WeM/4/) and
        [http://jsfiddle.net/C3WeM/5/](http://jsfiddle.net/C3WeM/5/)),
        so no need to define the extra display property.

        Using aria-hidden=false is also an interesting idea. The only
        downsides I see is that it adds an extra aria-hidden=false rule
        and in theory by spec an element with aria-hidden=false and
        without aria-hidden attribute should have equal meaning… Anyway
        please submit an issue at github and let’s discuss your idea
        there.

    So I like the article a lot. The only thing that nags at me is
    calling it the “native” DOM. So the inference is using JQuery is not
    the “native” DOM but at the end of the day JQuery is using the
    native DOM. It’s just a lib on top of the same exact language.
    Everyone these days is saying “native” to define whatever they want.
    They aren’t native API’s. They’re the JavaScript API’s. Native API’s
    would be the stuff that the JS runtime is calling from C.

        Hey Rick, I’m not calling jQuery “native” :) By “native” I mean
        APIs that available in browser without any library. The last
        part of the article is focused on jQuery only because it’s the
        most popular solution for working with the DOM.

        Do you care to enlighten us all on just what’s so ridiculously
        funny to you? The statement you quoted of his could’ve come from
        the mouth of myself or countless other web devs out there… Are
        you saying jQuery is flawless and to question it’s
        uber-DOM-manipulations is folly, borderline blasphemy??

        … the guy is trying to spark a conversation on OTHER solutions
        than the almighty jQuery because, in fact, jQuery is not perfect
        and there are many out there who’d absolutely welcome the
        addition of any viable options.

            Yes, jQuery IS as close to flawless as it can get. if you
            encounter issues I would say you ate doing things wrong.
            Extremely capable people are working hard on the lib. Just a
            random guy from the internet can’t possibly do any better,
            it’s ridiculous. Please. You could use presto. And what’s
            the deals with saying CSS animations are better than js??
            That is an outright lie. JS can render crazy things CSS
            isn’t close to handle. So please stop hating jQuery just
            cause you’re a web hipster who wants to do things
            differently.

                While i agree with you for the most part, CSS animations
                are better than JS. Everything you can do with CSS, you
                should do with CSS. Animations you can’t do in CSS – you
                use JS. Why? Performance. Especially on mobile.

                Nobody said CSS can replace JS for animations. But CSS
                animations (the ones you can do with CSS) ARE better
                than the same animations in JS.

                    \@Sumit. I would say CSS are good , but are not a
                    panacea and I would do a bit more research JS
                    animation can in fact be more performant and
                    significantly more flexible than CSS. Have a look at
                    [http://css-tricks.com/myth-busting-css-animations-vs-javascript/](http://css-tricks.com/myth-busting-css-animations-vs-javascript/).
                    This is written by one of the developers of GSAP but
                    he does do a very good analysis and very
                    informative.

                    Just as jQuery has been a boon to interactive web,
                    doesn’t mean jQuery does things perfectly. it was
                    quite some time before jQuery has easing that
                    matched Moo tools.

                    Everyone has different requirements so blanket
                    assertions by any developer are not always valid. In
                    the case of Maksim’s work I could see this being
                    useful in many Web applications where the front-end
                    js goes into the thousands of lines. It I can get
                    the functionality I need by reducing the written
                    code great. Isn’t that just one aspect a developer
                    wants.

                    @Kevin, thanks for the interesting link. But that
                    article is focused on performance, although you
                    should also keep in mind other things:

                    \1) power consumption.\
                     Having all animation logic in CSS is much simpler
                    to optimize on hardware-level, because it’s easier
                    to predict a next frame. I believe CSS animations
                    will always win in this field.

                    \2) separation of concerns.\
                     I remember the times when people used mouseenter
                    and mouseleave to change color of links. Then :hover
                    pseudoselector was included into CSS and currently I
                    do not know a lot of developers who still uses JS
                    for such simple effects.

                    When CSS3 animations spec was proposed I think the
                    world started to move animations (at least simple
                    ones) into CSS. So accepting this point of view
                    earlier is future-proof as well.

                    \3) file size.\
                     Implementing animations in JavaScript will
                    definitely require more code.

            Relax Brandon. When you use jQuery you vanquish every foe
            with a couple of seconds thought and a couple of lines of
            code. It can be hard switching out of that mode when
            entering back into the real world.

    We’ve been accustomed to think in jQuery. (IE 11′s spell checking
    dictionary has even adopted this word.) And the SelectorListener you
    gave us pollutes the document and DOM objects, so I don’t think it a
    good choice.

    And to Smashing Magazine, when I wanted to submit my reply, I tabbed
    from the “Your message\*” (let me call it so) textarea and I
    expected a submit button to hold the focus. But what was really
    focused is the logo link on the header. I felt confused.

        Unlike SelectorListener the better-dom library does not modify
        any native prototypes with additional methods (the exception is
        legacy IEs that get standards-based goodies from es5shim and
        html5shiv).

    I enjoyed this article and would like to read more about this
    library. Wrapping all the elements returned by findAll in the
    equivalent of $() would save me a lot of grief. A new approach to
    attaching event handlers would be nice too. I basically never want
    to attach an event handler to a specific element, I almost always
    want it attached “live” to a selector rooted at the document.
    Anyway, I’m not dropping jQuery just quite yet ;) But thanks for
    explaining where you’re coming from and talking through the issues
    you have. \*Something\* will eventually replace jQuery, we might as
    well be thinking about it.

    Interesting work, Maksim.

    It reminds me a little of Dean Edwards’ “Javascript Behaviors”:\

    [http://dean.edwards.name/jsb/behavior.html](http://dean.edwards.name/jsb/behavior.html)\
     Especially the “live extensions” feature.

    I also have similar goals with my “DOM Sprockets” project:\

    [https://github.com/meekostuff/DOMSprockets](https://github.com/meekostuff/DOMSprockets)\
     Its alpha quality, but you can see some demos at:\

    [http://devel.meekostuff.net/DOMSprockets/0.2-devel/demos/](http://devel.meekostuff.net/DOMSprockets/0.2-devel/demos/)\
     I’m always keen for feedback.

    One thing I liked in JSB is that “behaviors” encourage inheritance.
    Can I do that with “live extensions”?

    I didn’t like that JSB passed the proxied element as the first
    argument of all method calls – I’m glad to see better-dom \*does
    not\*.

    I \*do\* think better-dom should provide lower-level access to
    objects. For instance:\
     - in the constructor or event handler \`this\` will be a proxy for
    an element, but can I get the proxied element? (I’m guessing
    \`this.\_node\` does this?)\
     - DOM.find() will return a default proxy for an element. Can I get
    the proxy for any “live extensions” that have been applied to the
    element.

    How do you handle the situation where two “live extension”
    registrations might target the same element? I only permit one per
    element which \*should be\* based on selector specificity (but is
    currently the last one registered). I suspect this is the least
    surprise for a page-author since it matches CSS properties. But it
    does create more work for my library.

    Is there a use-case for late-binding of event handlers that can’t be
    achieved by changing the state of the proxy object or proxied
    element and having the handler respond to that state? e.g.

    button.\_handleClick = function() { if (!this.\_disabled)
    alert(“click!”); };\
     button.on(“click”, “\_handleClick”);\
     button.fire(“click”); // shows “clicked” message\
     button.\_disabled = null;\
     button.fire(“click”); // shows nothing

        \1. You can always access native elements via the \`legacy\`
        method (take a look at the end of the VALUE OF THE [] OPERATOR
        section)

        \2. I was thinking about inheritance in the beginning as well,
        but ended with multiple extensions applied to the same element.
        I didn’t have any real life use cases when need to inherit and
        modify an extension declaration itself.

        \3. DOM.find() will usually return an element wrapper with ALL
        extensions applied. There is no possibility to apply an
        extension manually, frankly I do not see any value for doing
        this.

        \4. Of course it’s possible to cover all late binding use cases
        via simple event listeners (you got the idea how according to
        your example). It’s just a syntax sugar for a specific type of
        event handlers.

            Hi Maksim,

            Thanks for the reply. I completely missed the \`legacy()\`
            method.\
             I’m surprised that you have no real life use cases for
            inheritance with “live extensions” – I’m using it all the
            time. Can you link to some examples for “live extensions”?

                Hey Sean, you can find some examples of live extensions
                here:
                [https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom\#projects-that-use-better-dom](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom#projects-that-use-better-dom).

                As for inheritance I probably should clarify why. The
                reason is that \`DOM.extend\` from better-dom is close
                by goals to “Decorators” from Web Components or HTC
                behaviors from Microsoft. Originally I wanted to make a
                “library for creating polyfills”.

                UI widget hierarchies look cool but they are usually too
                dependent. It’s hard just to grab a single component and
                use it in your particular project, you had to add tons
                of extra stuff. Therefore I like to develop small
                independent widgets or polyfills that do not rely on
                each other.

                \`DOM.extend\` respects declaration order, so it’s
                possible to override public methods and event handlers
                (late binding could help here) by defining a new live
                extension that matches the same selector after a parent.
                But as I noted above I’d not recommend to develop
                widgets that rely on each other. It’s not a bugs-free
                strategy as well.

                Sean,

                Maybe you should pass some examples to Maksim. Even
                better maybe you should both talk more, maybe there is
                ways to integrate or tie the projects together (Sean,
                haven’t looked at your work yet.)

                One thing I find is that some many people create
                “different” wheels that at some point there are too
                many. I think that is why jQuery became so popular.

    Thanks Maksim -Nice article, but why is it thanks to Apple that css
    has good support for animation now?

    Safari, Firefox and Chrome are all fine browsers and have good
    support for animations and transitions. Safari and Chrome both
    introduced these features early and relied on Webkit to do so.

    If anything the market share of Chrome has done more than Safari to
    make using css animations and transitions practical. Although no web
    browser, layout engine or company deserves full credit for this.

    “how native APIs really work and [how] we can just use them instead
    of including an extra library.”

    I assume by “native APIs” you are referring to vanilla JS, not
    requiring additional libraries to function.

    Using your better-dom would ironically mean to depend on an extra
    library rather than the “native API”. What was the point again? –
    Using native APIs instead of extra libraries?

        Yes, we still need a library for working with the DOM. The point
        of the introduction is that by learning native APIs we could
        better understand what features browsers have at present. Having
        these knowledge in mind we could discover new cool ides and make
        our libraries lighter when possible (for instance by dropping
        JavaScript animations and using CSS3 capabilities instead).

    Wouldn’t this make more sense:

    or is there another way to gain access to the event object?

    Allowing access to the original event object means that the user can

        I want to drop the event object from arguments to improve code
        testability. You can still access all properties by providing an
        extra array argument with property names that you want to use in
        your event handler:

        var handleKeyDown = function(which, shiftKey) {\
         // use which to determine key code, or shiftKey to check if
        shift was pressed\
         };

        input.on(“keydown”, handleKeyDown, ["which", "shiftKey"]);

        Such approach could take some time to adopt but you’ll
        understand the advantage when start to write tests for your
        widget/component.

        I’d like to make an important note here: the i18n solution
        doesn’t aim to solve the multilanguage problem for a whole web
        page. It should be used in small independent widgets or
        components. For example, common validity messages for a form
        validation polyfill, date picker labels etc.

    It sounds like you have some misconceptions about properties and
    attributes. It seems pretty clear to me why it would be useful to
    represent characteristics of DOM elements as objects other than
    strings (which is all you get with attributes). For example:

    - “checked” and other Boolean attributes. The property could not be
    more simple: it is true or false. There exists much confusion about
    the correct attribute equivalent for a true value: is it “true”
    (no), “” (no), “checked” (yes, but not in old IE). Also, the
    “checked” property and “checked” attribute are not equivalent: the
    property that corresponds to the “checked” attribute is
    “defaultChecked”. Same for “value” and “defaultValue”, and
    “selected” and “defaultSelected”.

    - “style”. An element’s style property is an object with individual
    properties corresponding to CSS style properties. This allows direct
    querying and setting of an individual style property without having
    to parse or assemble a string containing all the element’s style
    properties, which is clearly superior.

    - Numeric properties such as size, width, height. It’s convenient to
    deal with these as numbers rather than strings.

    The distinction between properties and attributes is really
    important. I touched on reasons why above in the paragraph on
    Boolean attributes. jQuery used to think as you do and had a single
    attr() method that provided an unholy mixture of property and
    attribute access, but eventually in 1.6 introduced prop() that went
    some way towards acknowledging their initial mistake.

        I think you misunderstood the idea of getter and setter: they
        use \*properties\* at first and then fallback to attributes.
        Therefore:

        var input = DOM.create(“input[type=checkbox]“);

        typeof input.get(“checked”); // =\> “boolean”\
         typeof input.get(“style”); // =\> “object”\
         typeof input.get(“tabIndex”); // =\> “number”

        The mistake of jQuery was that they chosen a confusing method
        name (attr). I do believe that in typical situations you need
        properties, not attributes (they are faster too).

        Anyway you can always access attributes via
        input.get(“attributes”) which returns a native array of Attr
        objects.

        Yeah, I’m aware of the eq method. The problem of jQuery’s
        approach that the value of the [] operator forces you to call
        $() when you use a functional method. Compare:\
         jqLinks.each(function(i, el) { console.log( $(el).html() ) });\
         domLinks.each(function(el) { console.log( el.get() ) });

        This is also annoying when you use a 3d party library:\
         \_.find(jqLinks, function(el) { return $(el).prop(“title”) ===
        “stop” });\
         \_.find(domLinks, function(el) { return el.get(“title”) ===
        “stop” });

        Notice that in case of better-dom I’m just using the \*el\*
        variable without wrapping it.

    This library looks like a fantastic alternative to jQuery. I’ll try
    it on my next project. There are plenty of good ideas, but two of
    them seemed wrong in my opinion :

    - This legacy method is even uglier than jQuery.get. Why pass a
    function as an argument ? I know that extending native DOM Objects
    is a bad idea and the biggest mistake Prototype.js has done. But
    what about checking native Element properties and methods when these
    do not match anything in your better-dom-object ? This does not fix
    the Hammer issue though. I hope you’l find a safe way to reduce this
    abstraction gap between native and better DOM objects. This is what
    gave me many troubles with jQuery too.

    - I don’t see the point of your internationalization helpers. Why
    would anyone want to change the language of a small portion of a
    document, or even a single element? That does not make any sense.
    Also, I can not imagine declaring all the labels in all the
    languages supported on the client side. Without JS templating the
    whole document and outsourcing language files, it seems to me
    inconceivable to put internationalization on the client. And :before
    pseudo-elements everywhere, really ? Doubling number of nodes ? What
    if I already use :before on my label ? I suggest you separate these
    helpers from the rest of the project, since they solve too few
    cases.

        Hey Sylvain!

        \1. the legacy method accepts a function because of safety: you
        may call it on a single element, collection and an empty node.
        No need to do a null or length checks. In better-dom you should
        use native elements in a very rare cases, like described in the
        article. Why? They are unsafe and buggy.

        \2. Changing language of a part on page could be useful, for
        instance to see a preview of something in a different language.\
         Also I agree that i18n should not be used for a whole page,
        take a look at my comment:

            \1. I though separating find and findAll would have
            prevented the developer to ask if it is an element or a
            collection. If I want to work with potentially multiple or
            non-existent native elements, my first instinct would be to
            use findAll and .each so that we retrieve the function
            wrapper safety ; without imposing another closure for single
            elements \*that we know they’re here\*.

            \2. Do you plan to make a custom build script so that we can
            select which modules we want to include ?

                \1. Correct, just use \`legacy\` instead of \`each\` if
                you need to access native elements. \`legacy\` is the
                same as \`each\` except it has one extra argument:\
                 DOM.findAll(“a”).legacy(function(native, el, index,
                collection) { … });

                \2. With browserify it’s very easy to compile a custom
                build. I just need to investigate what kind of
                requirements do people have and verify dependencies.

                A live extension encapsulates a widget or component on
                your web page. It’s not a MV\* framework, although
                better-dom APIs could be used to create it. I’m big fan
                of rendering HTML on server-side, so created
                better-ajaxify
                ([https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-ajaxify](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-ajaxify))
                which is just a simple PAJAX solution (again, not a MV\*
                framework).

                The biggest advantage of live extensions is that they
                could be combined with any existing framework in market
                – plain jQuery, Backbone, Angular, Ember etc.
