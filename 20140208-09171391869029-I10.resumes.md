Finding a job is easy. As a job seeker, having your résumé in `.pdf`
format is all you’ll ever need. Creating a clean résumé in HTML5/CSS3
which scales well to different viewport sizes is a futile exercise.

All lies! Here are four reasons why it’s a great idea to author your
résumé in HTML:

1.  Static résumés become quickly outdated. A single, unified URL
    assures a recruiter or agency that your résumé is always up to date.
2.  A potential employer may view your résumé on a smartphone. Tethering
    our résumés to `.pdf` format is outmoded. Do you really want to
    trust a stiff, unresponsive `.pdf` to represent you?
3.  Editing `.pdf` files can be a painful experience.
4.  A DIY HTML résumé shows potential employers how much you love what
    you do, which can never hurt your chances.

Let’s look at the requirements for our [responsive
résumé](http://d.alistapart.com/a-case-for-responsive-resumes/demo.html).

-   It must be easy to maintain.
-   It must look spiffy.
-   It must scale well to smaller devices.

It must be easy to maintain
---------------------------

Evaluating document maintainability comes down to this: *how efficiently
can we locate and update various parts of the document?* The easiest way
to achieve maintainability is to create minimal, clear markup. So that’s
exactly what we’re going to do.

Examining the source, you’ll notice nothing shocking. After a simple
`header`, we’ve established two columns, and each column houses various
`article` elements. In just a few lines of HTML, our markup is complete.

It must look spiffy
-------------------

Your résumé needs to look as awesome as you are, so we’ll call the `CSS`
cavalry for assistance. Using the mobile-first approach, we define
responsive rules for smaller viewports (less than 520px wide). Why did I
choose 520 pixels as the media query *breaking point*? This particular
design looks a bit too condensed at sizes smaller than 520px. The number
is completely arbitrary and specific to your own design.

A little flair isn’t a bad thing, so I added a simple `CSS` transition
toward the bottom of our media query which adds a nice touch in
supporting browsers. Browsers that don’t support transitions will ignore
it. Enlarge your webkit browser from small (less than 520px) to large to
view the transition.

    .date-ranges {
        width: 15.4639%;
        transition:all .3s ease;
        -o-transition:all .3s ease; 
        -moz-transition:all .3s ease;
        -webkit-transition:all .3s ease;    
    }

It must scale well to smaller devices
-------------------------------------

Resize the
[demo](http://d.alistapart.com/a-case-for-responsive-resumes/demo.html)
and test liberally. Our design is mobile-friendly and still retains its
good looks.

Where can I use this?

[Building Books with CSS3](/article/building-books-with-css3)
-------------------------------------------------------------

by Nellie McKesson

If you have space on a server, you can store your résumé there, so that
you can point a recruiter or agency to your always-current URL.
[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) users know that, at the time of
this writing, no field exists in a user profile to add a résumé or CV
URL. For now, we’re stuck with the old meat and potatoes document
upload. Sadly, this is the case on many other popular job-hunting sites
as well. And that’s exactly why I’ve written this article, to freshen
the stale air we’re breathing.

As many grizzled job veterans know, a sharp résumé and near-flawless
interview may *still* leave you short of your dream job. Competition is
fierce and never wanes. But finding new ways to distinguish ourselves in
today’s unforgiving economy is vital to a developer’s survival.

What’s holding you back from finishing that side project? It’s valuable,
but how will you ever find time for it? The secret is…drumroll…real
goals and deadlines, and a realistic plan on how to fit it into the open
spaces in your schedule. Time to get it on your to-do list and feel the
motivation kick in.

Workflow consolidation is the key to alleviating suck, ennui, and (some
of) the dangers of human error. If only it weren't so arcane and
sysadmin-y. Don't be put off by past trauma or bad first
impressions—task runners and build tools are here to help you take
control of your own destiny.
