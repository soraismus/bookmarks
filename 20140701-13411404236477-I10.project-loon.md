Earlier this month, Mike Cassidy, a project director at Google’s
high-risk research division X, woke before dawn in the Northwest
Brazilian state of Piauí. It was already warm and humid. He drove for an
hour to a clearing in a rural area and helped his team launch several
high-altitude balloons with a payload of Internet connectivity
technology—the nub of the project he directs called Loon. Then he jumped
into another car to race against the balloons’ flight path, speeding
along an unpaved road, dodging chickens and pigs, and finally arriving
at Agua Fria, a tiny community on the outskirts of the town Campo Maior.

Cassidy pulled up to a rural schoolhouse that had never been able to
receive high-quality Internet signals. (Locals sometimes climb trees to
try to get a signal for their mobile phones.) The principal, who doubles
as the lunchroom cook, ushered him into a classroom filled with
middle-school-age kids. Within minutes, one of the balloons he’d
launched that morning was overhead, enabling a teacher to get a
high-speed connection on his computer. The instructor was able to
supplement that day’s lesson about Portugal with Google maps and
Wikipedia. Students asked off-the-wall questions—and got answers
courtesy of Google. Later when Cassidy spoke to the kids, they shared
their goals: One wanted to be an engineer; another, a doctor.

Cassidy has always contended that by providing the Internet to unserved
areas, his project could help make those dreams achievable. A year after
the project’s public launch, he’s confident that Internet service
enabled by high-altitude balloons is more than a possibility. “We’ve
definitely crossed the point where there’s a greater than 50 percent
chance that this will happen,” he says.

When Google [announced Project Loon on June 15 last
year](http://www.wired.com/2013/08/googlex-project-loon/all/), a lot of
people were skeptical. But Google reports that since then, it has been
able to extend balloon flight times and add mobile connectivity to the
service. As a result, Google’s expectations are flying even higher than
the 60,000-foot strata where its balloons live.

“This is the poster child for Google X,” says Astro Teller, who heads
the division. “The balloons are delivering 10x more bandwidth, 10x
steer-ability, and are staying up 10x as long. That’s the kind of
progress that can only happen a few more times until we’re in a
problematically good place.” A year ago, balloons typically remained
aloft for a few days at most, and download speeds averaged one or two
megabits per second—comparable to the slowest wired Internet service.

Since the [first public test flights in New
Zealand](http://www.wired.com/2013/06/google_internet_balloons/all/),
Google’s balloons have clocked over a million and half kilometers.
Increasing the crafts’ endurance has been a key challenge. One balloon
expert originally scoffed at the claim that Loon balloons would
eventually keep going for an average of 100 days. “Absolutely
impossible—even three weeks is rare,” said [Per
Lindstrand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_Lindstrand), known for his
highly publicized forays with entrepreneur Richard Branson. Indeed,
during the first New Zealand tests, the balloons generally lasted only a
few days.

Google bumped up flight durations by extensively analyzing its failures.
Using former military operations people, it took pains to recover nearly
every downed balloon. Google’s testing procedures also got a boost from
winter’s polar vortex: Ground temperatures in South Dakota, where some
of the balloons are manufactured, went as low as -40 degrees Celsius,
about the same as what balloons encounter at 60,000 feet. So Google
could test the inflated materials at leisure. Ultimately, Loon engineers
concluded that one of the biggest factors in failure were small, almost
undetectable leaks in the polymer skins that must withstand huge
atmospheric pressure and up to 100 mph winds. Even a pinhole can shorten
a balloon’s lifespan to a few days.

The Loon crew not only strengthened the fragile seams where leaks often
occurred but took fanatic care in handling the envelopes. They used to
walk on the flattened polymer in stocking feet. Now only super-fluffy
socks will do. Google, being Google, tested this protocol before
implementing it. Teams were created, one wearing conventional socks and
the other donning fuzzy footwear. Both groups performed a rigidly
proscribed line dance, as if the spread-out balloon polymers were Urban
Cowboy-style dance floors. The fluffy-footed team created significantly
fewer pinholes. “We’re getting the next five billion online through a
line dance!” Teller says.

Google also improved Loon flight times by dramatically upgrading the
altitude control system, increasing the vertical range of the balloons
so they can catch more favorable winds. (Its balloons “steer” their way
around the world by placing themselves in wind currents headed in the
right direction.) As a result, it’s not unusual for Google to keep
balloons flying for 75 days. One craft, dubbed Ibis 152 (Google uses
bird species to nickname its balloons), has been aloft over 100 days and
is still flying. An earlier balloon, Ibis 162, circled the globe three
times before descending. (It completed one circumnavigation in 22 days,
a world record.)

The longer times aloft threatened to overwhelm the Loon software that
adjusts the flight plans. “We didn’t have the infrastructure ready,”
Cassidy says. When flights were shorter, Google could rely on data from
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But since NOAA only
supplies forecasts for 16 days out, Google now has to make sophisticated
guesses using a giant database of historical wind and weather data. To
plot the optimal path—one that maximizes battery life and avoids crummy
weather conditions—Google’s software recalculates as often as once a
minute. (During the long, speedy flight of Ibis 162, Google recalculated
8 million times.)

Google made a different kind of advance with Loon when it added the
capability to send data using the LTE spectrum—making it possible for
people to connect directly to the Internet with their mobile phones.
(Loon’s original Wi-Fi connection required a base station and a special
antenna.) Using LTE also helped Google boost the capacity of its
connections. Recent Loon payloads are providing as much as 22 MB/sec to
a ground antenna and 5 MB/sec to a handset.

With the advances made over the last year, Google has a clearer idea of
how it might eventually make money with Loon. In addition to connecting
the last few billion (and often cash-poor) Internet users, the project
might serve already-connected people with fat wallets by partnering with
existing providers to deliver a super-roaming experience. “It’s not
limited to rural areas,” Teller says. “Even in the middle of Silicon
Valley you can lose connections while driving; large buildings and hills
can block the signals. Balloons can fill in dead spots.”

When Loon began, Teller’s biggest worry was that powerful
telecommunications companies would view the project as a threat and
attempt to snuff the project. But in part because LTE makes it possible
for Google to interweave its service with existing mobile data
networks—standard service in cities, Loon connectivity in more remote
areas—the reaction has been the opposite. “Every telco wants to partner
with us,” Cassidy says. Google is working with the regional giant Vivo
and Telebras in its Brazil tests. It’s also working with Vodaphone in
New Zealand. “They’re teaching us about what they need and how they can
help,” Teller says.

Cassidy ticks off the goals for the next year: routine flights of 100
days, 100 balloons in the air at once (that’s four times the previous
high), and then a full ring of between 300 to 400 balloons circling the
globe to offer continuous service to a targeted area. Teller predicts
that Loon may actually make enough progress to become operational, at
least in the guise of a pilot program. Just where this will happen and
how many people it will serve, he doesn’t say.

Not surprisingly, the Loon team is growing. Though Google won’t reveal
headcounts, it allows that the muscle behind the balloon effort is
comparable to other Google X projects like Glass or self-driving cars.

Still, Google seems to be hedging its bets on how to connect the world.
Last April, it bought Titan Aerospace, a two-year-old company that makes
high-altitude, solar powered drones that offer a non-inflatable approach
to wireless Internet. (Facebook reportedly also bid on Titan; not long
afterward it bought another drone company,
[Ascenta](http://qz.com/193045/these-are-the-people-who-will-build-facebooks-drones/).).
And earlier this month Google paid $500 million to acquire [Skybox
Imaging](http://www.wired.com/2013/06/startup-skybox/), a startup that
makes low-cost satellites; though the orbiting payloads will be mainly
used to augments its mapping operations, Google also said that the
technology might eventually help improve Internet access.

Teller contends that the multi-pronged approach is not chaos but
synergy. “The ethos of Google is to be loosely coupled,” he says. “If
everyone is dependent on one approach, the whole system slows down.” He
sees opportunities for collaboration. “Loon works with satellites as a
backup system,” he says. “Titan Aerostar might need Loon’s wind data.”

Loon’s leaders acknowledge there are plenty of potential obstacles that
may well pop their aspirations. But for now, Teller is optimistic. “On
Loon’s two-year birthday, I would hope, instead of running experiments,
we’ll have a more or less permanent set of balloons. In one or several
countries, you will turn on your phone and talk to the balloons,” he
says. “Yes, Loon will be offering service.”
