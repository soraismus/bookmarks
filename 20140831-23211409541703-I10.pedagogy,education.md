Lenny Gonzales

Learning styles—the notion that each student has a particular mode by
which he or she learns best, whether it’s visual, auditory or some other
sense—is enormously popular. It’s also been thoroughly debunked.

The scientific research on learning styles is “so weak and
unconvincing,” concluded a group of distinguished psychologists in [a
2008 review](http://psi.sagepub.com/content/9/3/105.abstract), that it
is not possible “to justify incorporating learning-styles assessments
into general educational practice.” [A 2010
article](http://www.changemag.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/September-October%202010/the-myth-of-learning-full.html)
was even more blunt: “There is no credible evidence that learning styles
exist,” wrote University of Virginia cognitive scientist Daniel
Willingham and co-author Cedar Riener. While students do have
preferences about how they learn, the evidence shows they absorb
information just as well whether or not they encounter it in their
preferred mode.

The “learning style” that teachers and parents should focus on is the
universal learning style of the human mind.

This doesn’t mean, however, that teachers and parents should present
material to be learned in just one fashion. All learners benefit when
information is put forth in diverse ways that engage a multitude of the
senses. Take, for example, a program that teaches math using music. At
Hoover Elementary School in Northern California, a group of
third-graders [learned to
connect](http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2012/04/using-musical-notes-to-teach-fractions/)
the numerical representation of fractions with the value of musical
notes, such as half-notes and eighth notes. Fractions are notoriously
difficult for young students to grasp, and a failure to catch on early
can hobble their performance in math into middle and high school.
Clapping, drumming and chanting gave these pupils another avenue through
which to understand the concept.

Called “Academic Music,” the program was designed by San Francisco State
education professor Susan Courey and three colleagues. Last month,
[Courey
reported](http://www.springerlink.com/content/xh4u54p5341l1551/)on the
results of Academic Music in the journal Educational Studies in
Mathematics. After six weeks of music-based teaching, students scored 50
percent higher on a fractions test than students in the same school who
attended conventional math classes. Children who started out with less
fraction knowledge responded well to the musical instruction, Courey
writes, “and produced post-test scores similar to their higher achieving
peers.”

The lesson here: The “learning style” that teachers and parents should
focus on is the universal learning style of the human mind, and two
characteristics of it in particular.

First, students benefit from encountering information in multiple forms.
They [learn more, for example, from
flashcards](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475207000886)that
incorporate both text and images—charts, graphs, etc.—than from cards
that display text alone.

Second, students’ interest is kept alive by novelty and variety, so
regularly turning away from textbooks and blackboards is key. As long as
the new activity genuinely informs the students about the academic
subject at hand, clapping a math lesson—or sketching in science class,
or acting during story time—can help every student to learn better.

    That’s utter trash. I really like lectures, they allow me to get
    more information because I capture things quicker when presented in
    an auditory format. When I am just shown visual examples, it’s like
    I see it, but I don’t take it in.

    I have a learning style and people I know have a different learning
    style. Ask us for amount of understanding with different formats,
    you will get extremely different results. I don’t know about these
    tests, but in my own experience of 10 years of schooling (with 7
    more to go), that is trash.

-   Knickygill

    There\
     also isn’t enough evidence to disprove learning styles. I for one,\
     never remembered how to do anything unless I am shown how to do it
    step by\
     step. Especially when it came to math. As a kid I had to be right
    next\
     to the teacher and watch every mark she made before I could even\
     conceive of how to solve the problem. I always sat up front so that
    I could see everything the teacher was doing and do be able to copy
    the overheads better. If I read things and then write\
     them down I also tend to remember them. Students in my class also
    exhibit this same trait. A few of them are fine just sitting back
    and listening and do good on tests but others do poorly if I don’t
    offer hand outs as well as the lecture. Some are better off reading
    the book and keeping their own notes on everything. So, I for one,
    will continue to\
     believe in “learning style”.

    -   Cindy

        Everybody who writes things down tends to remember them better.
        It’s not a style.

        -   Knickygill

            Yes, I understand that. My main point though was that
            everything started with being able to “see” what was going
            on.

-   C Warren

    There’s actually quite a lot of research to support different
    modalities. To cite two articles as evidence that modalities have
    been “thoroughly debunked” is irresponsible and silly.

    Look at the work of School of One in NY
    ([http://schoolofone.org/concept.html](http://schoolofone.org/concept.html))…
    One of the most interesting innovations to hit public education in
    years, highly based on the concept of modalities. Much more fresh
    and relevant than the two articles you cite.

    -   Kukth

        it’s been known for years that learning styles don’t exist. It
        suits a certain industry to propagate this myth.The same with
        “right brain – left brain”. There is a lot of money to be made.
        I’ve been taught this stuff and used it “on my students” without
        checking. And I always wondered why the majority of students
        turned out to not to have a clear preference at all. Just like
        myself. I just thought I asked the wrong questions

    -   Cindy

        Your link doesn’t work. I for one am delighted that someone
        questioned a concept which has been thoughtlessly shoved down
        our throats, and has never rung true. A good teacher does vary
        methods/activities frequently; it has nothing to do with
        so-called “styles.”

-   antoinette

    I believe they will pay attention and LEARN if they are being taught
    in a fashion they prefer.

-   John Kelly

    The science of learning styles aside, as an educator, I think we too
    often throw around terms such as “visual learner,” “right-brain
    thinker,” or “relational intelligence” without every really acting
    on these sorts of armchair psychological observations. I think the
    real key is not one style or another, but variety: we all learn when
    we are engaged, and multiple modalities, whether via music or
    movement, used with variety, promote engagement.

-   Scott

    For those defending learning styles, researchers come to these
    conclusions because the studies that tried to match learners with
    their supposed learning style did not produce superior results to
    groups that simply had a variety of activities. When decades of
    research comes up with zero, that’s a big hint for the field to move
    on.

    And besides, unless you are engaging in one-on-one tutoring, trying
    to identify the learning styles (or let’s just call them
    ‘preferences’) and then tailoring each day’s lesson to match all the
    different types of students you have is quite a task. Even if
    learning styles existed, for practical reasons there wouldn’t be
    much we could do about it in most teaching contexts.

    -   http://twitter.com/robynaway Robyn Spicer

        Agreed. It would be ridiculous to think a teacher would try to
        match to each child’s learning styles in every lesson. That’s
        overwhelming and not effective use of time and often not
        effective for learning. I would never advocate for that.
        However, to make an effort to adjust your style of teaching so
        you hit on different preferences is not a bad thing. Students
        learn from a variety of different stimuli, especially in this
        day and age. I’m not in anyway suggesting that a teacher should
        create tasks to suit every learning style, but it’s not in all
        students’ best interests to stick to just one style because it
        suits the teacher or one particular group of students. Mix it up
        a little. The students will respond.

        I am not an advocate of placing students in one learning
        preference box and making them stick there. We all learn
        different types of skills in different types of ways. To force
        students to do a task in a visual way because they have been
        identified as visual learners is not effective if it doesn’t
        suit the learning objective. That’s where professional judgement
        comes in.

        Teaching is massively complicated, mixing up your delivery style
        is something good teachers consider. A professional teacher will
        take the well researched elements of a theory and apply them to
        their students and context as appropriate. To adopt anything
        without thought is not the mark of a well educated person.
        Neither is it to write it all off based on two research papers.

    Call it what you want, but the facts in my own personal life are
    that my high school grade point average and my ability to take in
    info and understand it would indicate one thing (I Did not do well)
    but as I learn trades and skills as an adult would indicate another
    thing. How a trade is taught by a job or boss has direct results in
    performance and can be tracked. It is very different than school….
    Would that indicate learning styles make a difference? but i’m no
    brain child just a guy who struggled in school but my bosses love
    me….who knows? certainly not me….Teach those kids Mr. Miles!!!

-   http://twitter.com/robynaway Robyn Spicer

    I think part of the argument in favour of learning styles is to get
    people to think about other ways of teaching than chalk and talk.
    Yes people can learn different things in different ways and not
    everything has to be suited to one’s particular learning style in
    order for one to learn, but by opening up this debate we are making
    classroom learning more engaging. You could be overwhelmingly
    auditory but if someone lectures to you non-stop for 6 hours a day,
    you are not likely to learn as effectively as you might when you had
    multiple modalities engaged. I can see flaws in the learning
    profiles approach as it can be pigeon hole students without thought,
    but to maintain traditional and often dull methods of instruction
    because you don’t buy into learning styles is probably worse. Like
    any educational theory, it should not be adopted without careful
    consideration, but I’ve seen a lot of the strategies linked to
    learning styles really work well to engage kids. It shouldn’t be
    written off because of two research articles, for I’ve seen dozens
    which aregue the opposite.

-   Brett Coryell

    For those who rightly note the practical difficulty of assessing
    individual learning styles and then tailoring instruction,
    individual or group, to those styles, I would suggest that we’re
    missing the most important promise of “how we will learn.”

    Imagine a class where the major learning objective (and eventually
    the minor, and micro objectives) are all able to be delivered via
    multiple styles and sometimes with more than one perspective within
    that style. Especially in a flipped classroom, this would allow
    students to select their preferred learning style and then with some
    assessment, determine whether they think they have mastered the
    concept. If not, they can choose another perspective from the same
    style and try the concept again or choose a different style.

    Over time, an intelligently constructed LMS could and should begin
    to notice your own personal style preferences and suggest lessons
    for you in your preferred modalities. This is actually easier than
    what Amazon and Netflix do when they suggest something new to buy or
    watch.

    One step further is the idea that the LMS could also assess your
    progress when presented with lessons in your preferred style alone
    as compared to when you are presented first with your preferred
    style and then reinforced (immediately or periodically) with other
    modalities. It then could enhance your learning and retention by
    tailoring your raw information acquisition and concept formation by
    learning about you in the same way a skilled tutor would. The
    difference is that “the system” can do it for everyone, whereas a
    teacher cannot.

    This is the future of eduction. Skilled instructors will still have
    their place, but it will be in doing things that an LMS cannot, such
    as adapting to individual, unique, advanced, or deliciously
    outlandish questions. Instructors can then leave to the LMS the
    things that instructors cannot do, such as repeatedly assessing and
    individuating instruction for 100 students.

-   http://www.kidzmet.com/ Jen Lilienstein

    A few points with regard to different aspects of this debate. First,
    four points excerpted from the debunking research that need
    highlighting:

    From Points of Clarification\
     “Although we have argued that the extant data do not provide
    support for the learning-styles hypothesis, it should be emphasized
    that we do not claim that the same kind of instruction is most
    useful in all contexts and with all learners.” (p116)“Educators’
    attraction to the idea of learning styles partly reflects their
    (correctly) noticing how often one student may achieve enlightenment
    from an approach that seems useless for another student.” (p116)“It
    is undoubtedly the case that a particular student will sometimes
    benefit from having a particular kind of course content presented in
    one way vs. another.” (p116)From Everybody’s Potential to Learn\
     “It is undeniable that the instruction that is optimal for a given
    student will often need to be guided by the aptitude, prior
    knowledge, and cultural assumptions that a student brings to a
    learning task.” (p117)Secondly, the efficacy of different learning
    styles is largely dependent upon the learning outcome you’re looking
    to achieve. Take the triathlon events. All of us CAN swim, bike and
    run during the race. You CAN get in shape any of the three ways. But
    most of us PREFER one or two of these sports to the others as our
    preferred methods to keep fit. It’s the same with mind muscles.I
    agree that in a classroom setting of 30-40 kids, it’s tough to work
    with these preferences which is why it works better to work all
    three aspects into curriculum design. But it’s not as tough in
    breakout groups to share tips and techniques with students of
    similar preferences that they can use not just with this lesson, but
    throughout school/life. And when developing IEPs and RTIs for
    struggling students, these preferences NEED to be acknowledged. From
    a brain perspective, we all “chunk” knowledge in different ways. And
    there are faster recall paths for some of us than others. When you
    think back to a recent vacation, what memories resurface first? How
    it felt? What you saw? What you heard? Inevitably, all aspects come
    back, but speed of recall does count…especially in timed tests.My
    final point is that learning styles–whether they be VAK, Multiple
    Intelligences, Kolb, personality type, or the litany of other models
    that exist–are trying to work toward a greater learning outcome than
    solely test scores. They’re methods to make learning more fun,
    inspiring and engaging for your students during class time so that
    they’re more likely to pursue self-directed learning during their
    free time…or that will give your struggling students more tools in
    their tool belt to understand concepts during homework when no one
    else is available to help them.

    When kids are passionate about what they are learning, they learn by
    whatever means is available.”Learning styles” is just one of those
    methods to get kids to learn stuff they don’t care about. It’s like
    a shoehorn. Anything to get that shoe on. But if it’s too tight,
    it’s too tight. First find out WHO your students are and WHAT their
    strengths are, WHAT makes them energized and happy to be learning.
    Then the need to find learning styles becomes superfluous.

    but that does not make it ok to assume that the student with a
    different learning style, making them slower or less successful in
    school, is just lazy or less intelligent. i have a very different
    style than the style in which classes are taught at my school. this
    makes it extremely hard to be successful. however, i get top grades
    on all major tests and an IQ of 134. i also have ADHD and dyslexia.
    i agree that it would be ridiculous to try to teach classes to fit
    every type of learning style, but that does not mean it is
    acceptable to discount different learning styles as stupidity,
    laziness, or lack of intellect.

    I don’t think the idea of learning styles is really a scientific
    thing, but more of a preference. I prefer the “read/write” method
    but I know people that prefer lectures of hands-on work. I don’t
    think any sort of science can measure opinion at all.

-   Carey

    I agree with you. I also have a learning style and it is opposite of
    yours.

-   southbound32

    I think you may misunderstand Willingham’s explanation about the
    different between “preference” and “style”. That you like the
    lecture method is a “preference”. If you’re theory is right, then
    it’s fair to say that if one is a visual learner, then they will do
    poorly in a verbal environment. But according to research, this fact
    has never been show. In fact, the opposite has been show, that both
    styles succeed in one style environment. That’s one thing to think
    about, among many other ideas that a small article like this just
    can’t get to explaining.

    -   lauren

        I disagree with the research in this article. I am a visual
        learner learners and when I get taught through different methods
        I just cannot take it in. For example; if I ask for directions
        and a person tells me them verbally, I can simply not take in
        the route, whereas if I take a map and they show me the way and
        I can easy visualise where I am going. I am not sure where they
        got this research from but it does not match my life experience.

        -   southbound32

            That’s actually the whole point of the article and his
            research. You’re actually proving his point. Your preference
            is visual. That’s how you prefer to receive information. Not
            only that, but he argues that we should use the best method
            at aligns with the material. So, in your example, a map
            would be the best way since the context is about directions
            and route. I think you agree with this article more than you
            realize.

                Give ‘visual learners’ sheet music, and ask them to keep

                ‘style’ is best depends on medium.

-   Barry Wiginton

    I would tend to agree with others who have commented on this blog
    that the true argument is whether there are “learner styles” or
    simply “learner preferences”. I say, forget the semantics and focus
    on learning environments that provide the most individualized
    instruction possible. According to Bloom (1968) over 90% of students
    can mastery any subject and that it is “the basic task of education
    to find strategies which will take individual differences into
    consideration but in such a way as to promote the fullest
    development of the individual.” I’d say Bloom believed that students
    learned differently and at different rates. Whether he called it
    Learning Styles or Learning Preferences is of no consequence.

    I agree with the article. I think too many have focused on the idea
    of individual differences and interpreted that to mean that each
    person learns in only one unique way, which is a distortion of the
    learning process. Every new lesson is enhanced and set as a
    permanent lesson when introduced in multiple ways-irrespective of
    the individual differences of the learner. While repetition is key
    to learning, it should not imply rote and isolated from life
    experiences.

    pieces together…only looking at directions when I’m stuck…and I

    disciplined. How do you learn to swim or to drive? To read and
    write? You are being shown an example and repeat it lots of times
    until you master it. No need to sing you a song about swimming or
    show you a video about doing multiplication tables if the time could
    be used more sensibly to just sit down and practice. Stop all this
    non-sense, get them to sit down, be quiet and behave. There wasnt
    even a projector or a CD-Player when my dad went to school but his
    academic skills after 10 years of schooling are better than most BA
    student’s.\
     Chalk and blackboard all the way if you ask me.

-   John McCarthy

    It’s unfortunate when learning styles are looked at with such a
    narrow focus, which is the case of the research and logic presented
    in this article. The one significant point that I’d agree is that
    instruction should include different modalities. This type of
    experience, what I’d call cross-training, or 3-Dimensional Learning
    gives students opportunities to process information through a
    variety of perspectives. Learners do learn through modalities, it’s
    just not one modality, nor all modalities.

    Arguments against learning styles tend to focus on the critique that
    students are placed in single learning containers, I’m visual, I’m
    kinesthetic, or I’m auditory. We have varying levels of each of
    these examples. Interestingly, have you noticed that the major focus
    of critics is on Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences, and it’s
    typically on the 3 of his 9 that they life to argue, “See!”
    Gardner’s approach works. It works better when combined with other
    schools of learning styles, such as Robert Sternberg’s Triarchaic
    Theory of Multiple Intelligences. By the way, those critics stop
    going after Sternberg’s approach because they can’t argue against
    the field research. At least get the other side: Here’s an Edutopia
    article that addresses Learning Profiles:
    [http://www.edutopia.org/blog/learning-profiles-john-mccarthy](http://www.edutopia.org/blog/learning-profiles-john-mccarthy)
    It includes strategies to manage and teach students.

By Therese Jilek As the school year begins, most classrooms across the
country will mirror traditional class design: rows of desks with passive
children sitting quietly listening to a teacher in the front of the
class. But not at Hartland-Lakeside. Across the Hartland-Lakeside school
district in Hartland, Wisconsin, teachers have transformed their
Industrial Age classrooms […]
