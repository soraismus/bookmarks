#### Yahoo, Yahoo Mail, And Flickr Hit With Temporary Service Interruption

![image](http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/airpair.jpg?w=400)

Learning the fundamentals of programming is easy. But becoming an
*expert*? That’s damn hard. There are a million and one languages, each
with their own nuances, strengths, and weaknesses. Worse yet, the
programming hype train is always chugging away; just when you think
you’ve mastered the world’s greatest language, everyone will be talking
up some new language or framework or database and your boss’ boss will
be asking why you’re not using that, instead.

AirPair connects you with expert programmers, on-demand.

We first wrote about AirPair [back in
March](//techcrunch.com/2013/03/04/airpair-connects-startups-with-expert-developers-to-get-help-with-code-via-online-sessions/)
of last year. Back then, it was just a one-man shop with an interesting
idea. It seemed like something that *should* work, but it was a bit too
early to tell. They’d done just seven on-demand calls, and had but a
handful of experts to call in. Their service was, at its core, a Google
Docs form.

11 months later, the idea seems to be working out. The one-man team has
grown to five, and found their way into Y-Combinator’s most recent
class. That handful of experts has grown into the thousands. They’ve
ditched the Google Doc form, building up a proper site and service
around the idea. Companies like
[Intel](http://www.airpair.com/ember.js/training-on-demand) are turning
to them to figure how which frameworks to adopt internally. While they
kept their actual numbers under wraps, the company tells me that they
reached [“ramen profitable”](http://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html)
levels shortly after launch, and have been growing their revenue 40%
month-over-month ever since.

So how does it work?

If you’re familiar with Google Helpouts, the idea here is quite similar
— just far more focused on a specific topic (and, to be fair to them,
AirPair launched months before we broke the news of [Helpouts’
existence](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/meet-helpouts-googles-secret-plan-to-bring-live-video-commerce-to-local-businesses/)).

First, you tell AirPair what sort of expert you’re looking for. Need
help with an Android app? Trying to determine which Javascript framework
would be best suited for your new web app *before* you start digging
into one? (For the curious, I asked AirPair where they’re seeing the
most demand. In no particular order: Angular.JS, Ember.JS, and of course
iOS/Android)

From there, you tell AirPair how much you’re willing to pay per hour,
with each tier opening up access to a wider pool of experts. $60 an
hour, for example, gets you access to around 15% of the site’s experts —
the folks who can answer most basic coding questions. $90 an hour opens
it up to people who’ve been coding for a few years, and can tell help
you start to crack the tougher issues. It goes all the way up to $300 an
hour, at which point you’re talking to people who more or less live in
code; the people who (literally) [wrote the
book](http://www.airpair.com/rails/expert-multi-tenancy-author-ryan-bigg)
on this stuff. (Each engineer on the service picks their own rate, with
AirPair gauging customer success/satisfaction to ensure that everyone
finds themselves in the right group.)

A few variables can send the price up or down, though. By default,
sessions are private — but if you’re willing to let them record the
session and share it publicly, they’ll drop the price a bit. Need the
engineer on the other end to sign an NDA before your company will let
you talk to them? They’ll organize all of that, but it brings the price
up.

(Interestingly, that aforementioned session-sharing is part of how the
company targets new customers. If you’ve allowed them to share the
session, they’ll upload it to YouTube and tag it based on the topic
matter. If people turn to Google with an issue and their video pops up,
it serves as an ad for the next time that person finds themselves
stumped.)

Once the pricing is set, AirPair takes over. Engineers don’t bid against
each other for sessions, nor do companies pick engineers themselves —
instead, AirPair picks the engineer they think is right for the gig,
based on availability, track record, pricing, and expertise. “We’re kind
of like Uber, in that sense.” AirPair co-founder Jonathon Kresner says.
“You don’t think of who’s picking you up, you just trust Uber’s drivers
are a certain level of quality. With AirPair, you trust our matching.”

But what about head-hunting? You have to imagine that if you’re offering
up a direct connection to “experts” in a field that’s currently
experience something of a talent drought, those people will be gettin’
job offers thrown in their face left and right. And if they get hired
away from the service, that’s one less expert they have to call on.

“We’re not scared about it. The people who are on our system could work
wherever they want anyway.” says Kresner. “But it definitely has
happened. We have a policy where after you’ve worked with an expert for
over 10 hours, you can pay a finder’s fee to engage them outside of
AirPair.”
