How to Create Your Own Git Server
---------------------------------

Although I'm a happy (also paying) user of GitHub's offerings, there are
times when I prefer to host a private repository on a server I control.
Setting up your own Git server can be useful if you're isolated from the
public internet, if you're subject to inflexible regulations, or if you
simply want features different from those offered by GitHub (and other
similar providers). Setting up a Git server on a Unix (Linux, Mac OS X,
\*BSD, Solaris, AIX) machine isn't difficult, but there are many details
to observe. Here is a complete guide.

Through the following steps you can setup and use your own Git server at
a server, say `myhost.example.com`. Some of the steps, like email
notifications, users with a restricted shell, and access control for a
particular group, are optional depending on your requirements and the
situation at hand. For many of the commands you will need administrator
(root) privileges, so prefix them with `sudo` or (heaven forbid) run
them from within a root shell.

-   Create a group for those who will have read/write access to the
    repository. Depending on your operating system you can do this using
    the `groupadd` command, using `vigr` to edit the group file, or
    editing directly the file `/etc/group`. In the end you want to have
    a line like the following in the `/etc/group` file.

        repogroup:*:10005:marry,john,violet

    where `repogroup` is the name of the group that will get access to
    the specific repository, 10005 is a unique group identification
    number, and `marry,john,violet` are the user identifiers of people
    that will get access to the repository.

-   Decide the directory where the git repositories will be located.
    This can be under your home directory (e.g.
    `/home/yourname/gitroot`) or in a dedicated directory (e.g.
    `/var/gitroot`).
-   Configure permissions so that git users can access that directory
    chmod g+rx /path-to/gitroot\
     chown :grouprepo /path-to/gitroot\
-   Create the new Git repository, say `newrepo`.
    **cd** /path-to/gitroot\
     git init --bare newrepo.git\
-   Setup the directory's permissions to allow and propagate group
    access, and configure Git accordingly.
    **cd** newrepo.git\
     chown -R :grouprepo .\
     git config core.sharedRepository group\
     find**.**-type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 2770\
     find**.**-type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod g=u\
-   Configure commit email notifications, so that developers will
    receive an email with a summary of the changes when these are pushed
    to the repository.
    **echo** **'**One-line project description**'** **\>**description\
     git config --local hooks.mailinglist
    email-a@example.com,email-b@example.com,...\
     git config --local hooks.emailprefix **'**[DI-PR] **'**\
     git config --local hooks.showrev **"**git show -C %s; echo**"**\
     git config --local hooks.emailmaxlines 100\
-   Setup a so-called hook to create these email notifications.
    **cd** hooks\
     cp post-receive.sample post-receive\
     chmod +x post-receive\
-   Remove the comment character `#` from the last line of the
    `post-receive` script, so that it will be as follows.
    **.**/path-to-hooks/post-receive-email\
-   Prime your repository with a file. This is needed in order to avoid
    confusing your other users with a strange error message on their
    first commit.
    **cd** to-your-personal-working-directory\
     git clone myhost.example.com:/path-to/gitroot/newrepo.git\
     **echo** **"**Short project description**"** **\>**README.txt\
     git add README.txt\
     git commit -a -m **"**Add README file**"**\
     git push origin master \# This first time only "origin master" args
    needed\
-   Create accounts for the repository's other users. Depending on your
    system you can do this with a command like `useradd` or `adduser`.
-   Set the users to access your host with a public/private key pair.
    This involves the following steps.
    -   Users who already have such a key pair, just need to send you
        their public key.
    -   Users who don't have a key pair, must generate one using the
        command `ssh-keygen` (accepting the default responses), and send
        you the file `.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
    -   You must then install that key under their account by copying
        the public key they sent you into your clipboard, and running
        the following command sequence.
        sudo su - username\
         mkdir -p .ssh\
         cat **\>\>**.ssh/authorized\_keys **<<\\EOF**\
         paste-key-as-one-line\
         **EOF**\
         **exit**\

-   Change user accounts to use a restricted shell. If you want the
    users you added to use your system only for Git, and not for
    general-purpose Unix processing, then set up their accounts to use
    Git's restricted shell. Git provides such a restricted shell crafted
    exactly for the purpose of running only its server-end part. It is
    usually installed in `/usr/libexec/git-core/git-shell` or
    `/usr/local/libexec/git-core/git-shell`. Therefore, for each user
    you want to offer restricted access run a command like the
    following.
    sudo chsh -s /usr/libexec/git-core/git-shell username\
-   Ask your users to clone the repository using a command like the
    following.
    git clone myhost.example.com:/path-to/gitroot/newrepo.git\

You're done!
