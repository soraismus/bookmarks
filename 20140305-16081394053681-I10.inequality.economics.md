Inequality
==========

### Does raising all boats lift the tide?

Mar 4th 2014, 11:45 by R.A. | LONDON

-   -   [Tweet](http://twitter.com/share)

SO LONG one believes that incentives matter, it stands to reason that
economies need at least a little inequality to grow. If one could do
just as well financially not innovating and not risk-taking as
innovating and risk-taking, then there would probably be quite a lot
less of both, with undesirable consequences for output. But growth can
often result in yawning gaps between the incomes of most working people
and those doing best in a society, which raises the question: does a
highly unequal distribution of income ultimately do more to undermine
growth than sustain it?

At some extreme that is unquestionably the case. An economy in which a
small group of elite capture all income is almost certainly not going to
be among the world's top growth performers. But at more normal market
distributions of income, does inequality hurt growth?

For a long time there hasn't been much consensus on the subject within
economics. The starting point for many in the profession has until very
recently been the work of Arthur Okun, who suggested that the
welfare-maximising policy in a society might well be one that involves
some redistribution, but policy-makers should be under no illusions
about the growth consequences of that redistribution. But the notion of
a strict trade-off between the two has been questioned by recent
economic work, including research by economists at the IMF, as this
week's [Free exchange
column](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21597931-up-point-redistributing-income-fight-inequality-can-lift-growth-inequality)
notes:

Looking across countries, the authors find that net inequality—after
redistribution—is associated with lower growth rates and shorter growth
spells. Redistribution, for the most part, is not. They do turn up a
relationship between shorter bursts of growth and increased
redistribution in economies that are already redistributing quite a lot.
But in general they find only a very weak (and slightly positive)
relationship between growth and redistribution, but a strong and
negative relationship between growth and inequality.

![image](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/print-edition/20140301_FNC432.png)

Though the authors are cautious in attribution of causation, their
analysis suggests that sensible redistribution which reduces net
inequality might well raise growth: since inequality is bad for growth
rates and redistribution is a wash.

Why would that be the case? This analysis is focussed on medium-run to
long-run growth, and so one possibility is that more unequal societies
are more hostile to liberal policies—like free trade or flexible labour
market rules—that facilitate long-run growth. Another possibility is
that redistribution tends to substitute for shaky borrowing by non-rich
households, of the sort that can undermine growth or cause nasty credit
meltdowns:

> In their 2011 paper Messrs Berg and Ostry note that more unequal
> societies do poorly on social indicators such as educational
> attainment, even after controlling for income levels. This suggests
> that households with lower incomes struggle to finance investments in
> education. In a recent paper Barry Cynamon of the Federal Reserve Bank
> of St Louis and Steven Fazzari of Washington University in St Louis
> reckon most Americans borrowed heavily before 2008 to prop up their
> consumption. That kept the economy growing—until crisis struck.

Of course, a more redistributive set of policies would look attractive
from a short-term perspective even if redistribution was less benign
over longer time periods, because much of the rich world is stuck facing
a chronic shortfall of demand. Shifting purchasing power from the rich
(which are less likely to consume a marginal unit of income) to more
credit constrained households down the income spectrum should
immediately boost demand. Supporters of a "secular stagnation" story for
economic weakness, in which there is excess saving in the economy
pushing interest rates down to the zero lower bound, often cite rising
inequality as a key mechanism. And then of course one confronts the
possibility that a long period of demand weakness generates a loss of
economic potential, so that even aside from the IMF analysis above a
rise in redistribution in highly unequal economies begins to look like a
decent idea from a long-run growth perspective.

As the Free exchange notes, there are surely devils in the details.
There are more and less foolish ways to achieve a desired level of
redistribution. Randomly expropriating fortunes and using the proceeds
to fund condition-free giveaways to middle-income households has
occasionally been a popular way to run a government in emerging market
economies, but it's a lousy way to try and boost growth. Progressive,
efficient tax reform used to fund investments in infrastructure and
investment, means-tested expansions in the safety net, and wage
subsidies for the working poor is a different story.

But there are lots of policy combinations out there, many of which
manage redistribution without trampling on incentives. What is important
to note is that the burden of proof in the argument over what to do
about inequality seems to be shifting—away from the default that high
incomes are self-justifying.

The chart says limited redistribution can work, i.e. to shift Gini by
0.1. But when one tries to shift the Gini by \>0.1 with redistribution,
it impacts growth.

The problem of declining labour share must result in some fall in
aggregate demand but I rather doubt that highly redistributive tax
regimes are a spur to economic growth or overall prosperity in the
longer run.\

I sort of wonder if the bureaucratic cost of means-and-otherwise-tested
benefits isn't a check on growth. We have an awful lot of brainy people
in the U.S. focusing their work on testing existing redistributive
programs from both directions. We have a lot of prominent idiots doing
nothing but debating taxes and spending from grand positions above the
earth. I have to wonder if a simplified tax code with lower marginal
rates and a minimum income program replacing disability insurance, AFDC
and WIC wouldn't be a good way to lock in the redistribution one party
(and the voters of the other, it seems) want and low tax rates to
satisfy the other.

Those could each work, but even together they likely wouldn't yield
enough to make much of a difference. Something more fundamental is
involved, and the piece doesn't touch on it -

The long sweep of history tells that the smartest, most adept players in
the poker game of life, and those most adept at gaming the system,
always end up with all the chips - and pass them on to the next
generation of their kind. That point of generational-passage is the
point where redistribution should be funded. How that money is dispensed
is another matter.

Agreed, but it isn't clear which chips count. Education, ambition and
hope accompany money as the gifts of aristocrats to their children.
Larceny and sloth are pretty fairly distributed. Vanity is widely
disbursed but especially concentrated among egalitarians.

That last bit is so appropriately cruel it leaves me almost speechless -
almost.

Lots of things count, and handling some of them best we can is better
than deciding that we'll handle none of them because we can't be sure if
we've gotten them all. Balance sheet wealth matters - act on that, first
and right now.

Another angle needs to be looked at: while it is true that
redistribution can make growth spurts last longer, I have also read a
study that shows that when a welfare entitlement is created, over the
long term the demand on that entitlement grows faster than the economy.
Hence welfare entitlements eventually become prohibitively expensive -
but not soon enough to prevent the lengthening of growth spurts as
described in the article.

It depends on how it is structured. An entitlement that is well
designed, with cost of living adjustments that account for substitution
effects, and in-built sunset and other review clauses would not have
this problem.

Sadly, most welfare entitlements in the real world are not well
designed.

*I have also read a study that shows*

Source please.

We ended "Welfare as we know it" in the 1990's.

As for Hui Shi's comment,\
 one must remember that:\
 A) no program of any type is "one size, fits all."

\B) no matter what program - welfare, defense, etc. - there are always\
 those that will find the loopholes or game the system to their
benefit.\
 (and that's after the "real gamers" game the system during the writing
of the law in the legislature.)

People continue to argue about inequality based on the question of
whether it is bad for those at the top to capture most or all of the
economic GAINS.

When the reality is that in the United States, with its aging population
and debt addled economy, the gains at the top are associated with LOSSES
for a rising share of the population. They are poorer than their
parents, poorer than prior generations were at the same age, paid less
than those holding similar jobs in the past.

There has been redistribution. More executive pay, less in dividends.
Rising prices for necessities, cheaper luxuries. Etc.

Let´s assume what you say is true.

Do people care about their income or the welfare that their income can
buy? Would you trade a middle class lifestyle of 2014 for a middle class
lifestyle in 1960? No computers, smartphones, long-distance flight,
lower life-expectancy, etc. I guess what I am trying to ask is whether
you only care about peoples income relative to others or their absolute
standard of living?

I think that is an important point to add to the inequality debate.

How can today's parents be poorer that previous generations?

My parents - and others - couldn't afford a cell phone when we were
kids.

**Girl, 14, struck and killed by train in Martinez**

Family members, friends and school officials are mourning the loss of a
14-year-old girl who was struck and killed by a train in Martinez when,
according to her mother, she tried to retrieve a cell phone she had
dropped on the tracks.

[http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Girl-14-struck-and-killed-by-train...](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Girl-14-struck-and-killed-by-train-in-Martinez-5283108.php "http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Girl-14-struck-and-killed-by-train-in-Martinez-5283108.php")\
 --

We also didn't have cable TV, video games, etc.

No, what has occurred is the expansion of credit, which allows people to
borrow and buy - paying back in another thing - which expands the the
profits for the financial system and for sellers of goods.

Toss in the addition of the 401(k), the IRA/Roth IRA, securities loans,
etc., and the outsourcing of jobs in order to secure "Everyday Low
Prices"....
