Angular on Rails :: First Attempt
=================================

Aug 17th, 2013 | [Comments](#disqus_thread)

I recently completed a 5 month project for a small realestate company
called BresicWhitney in which we built their [customer facing
website](https://www.bresicwhitney.com.au). This project was a milestone
for me for two reasons, the first being that I was returning to coding
after doing other stuff for two years, the second being that it was the
first time I put on the frontend developer hat. The last time I had
coded, I was on a project where we wrote a single page web app for an
insurance company using [sammy.js](http://sammyjs.org/). A bit has
happened in that time, noteably:

-   single page apps are more popular now, as evidenced by the variety
    of frameworks
-   web page designs and CSS has come a long way. The difference to what
    the designer does in photoshop and what actually gets built has got
    much less.

Anyway, I was determined to provide the best user experience I could so
I decided to go the single page app route again (to avoid page refreshes
and still have the URL to match the application’s state etc). I chose
Angular.js after hearing good things about it from colleagues. Rails was
the team’s choice for the server-side due to our collective skill sets.

For this post, I’ve cherry picked some the challenges I had,
particularly integrating Angular.js with Rails. It is in no way a
holistic guide.

Architecture
------------

The main components of the customer facing website are shown below. I’ve
left out the back-office application (kinda like the CMS) because it did
not use Angular.

Templating
----------

I elected to use [Haml](http://haml.info/) for my HTML DSL though I’d
probably consider [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/) next time. I ended up
having separate templates for the following cases:

-   page templates (displayed in the ng-view element)
-   directive templates

Directives are an awesome feature which I made use of extensively.

### first attempt: put everything in the header

To get myself up and running, I put the `= yield` statement in the
`<head>` section of the frontend Rails layout and then a loop in the
included index.haml to bring in the templates. A snippet is shown below:

    ['search_bar_template',
     'buy_listings_search_bar_template',
     'rent_listings_search_bar_template',
     'image_slider_template',
     'bed_bath_car_template',
     'street_address_details_template',
     'tenancy_application_template',
     .
     .
     .
     'disclaimer_template',
     'error_page_template',
     'contact_us_template'].each do |template_name|

      %script(type="text/ng-template" id="_#{template_name}.haml")
        = render :partial => "frontend/#{template_name}"

The template files themselves were put in the same folder as index.haml.
Thus, whenever I needed a new template, I’d create it and then add it to
the array above. I could then refer to the templates via `templateUrl`
in my javascript code.

This worked okay, except for the fact that there was a lot of “stuff” in
my `<head>` section. Also, the above technique requires that all
templates be loaded on the initial page load.

### second attempt: loading via ajax and bringing in the asset pipeline

One of Rails great fetures IMHO is the asset pipeline (provided by the
sprockets library). It basically allows for indefinite browser caching
for static assets – a feature I wanted to take advantage of for the
templates. Unfortunately, sprockets does not support Haml (the authors
don’t seem to like HTML DSLs) and the “haml” gem only supports putting
haml templates in the “views” folder. After reading through the
sprockets and sass gem source code, I cobbled together the following
code which allows Haml files in the asset pipeline for development mode
as well as pre-compilation:

In `application.rb`:

    require 'haml'

    config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join('app', 'assets', 'templates')

    class HamlTemplate < Tilt::HamlTemplate
      def prepare
        @options = @options.merge :format => :html5
        super
      end
    end

    config.before_initialize do |app|
      require 'sprockets'
      Sprockets::Engines #force autoloading
      Sprockets.register_engine '.haml', HamlTemplate
    end

This allowed me to put the templates in `app/assets/templates` (of
course this path is easy to change)

An then to load the templates from the browser side, I created a file
called `templates.coffee.erb`:

    templates_version_number = 1.6

    templates = ->
      templates = {}

      <% Dir.glob(Rails.root.join('app', 'assets', 'templates', '*.haml')).each do |f| %>
      templates["<%=  File.basename(f) %>"] = "<%= asset_path File.basename(f, '.haml')%>"
      <% end %>
        
      templates

    Frontend.Templates = templates()

    Frontend.Template = (logical_name) -> Frontend.Templates[logical_name]

And, from my routes and directive files, I could link to the template
via “templateUrl”, e.g.
`templateUrl: Frontend.Template '_tenancy_application_template.html.haml'`.
Keeping the template ID the same as the actual file name made the
template files easy to find.

One “gotcha” with this method is that if you create a new template, you
need to increment `template_version_number` so that the templates file
is recompiled with the new template. This is not required for
modifications to existing templates though.

This method has it drawbacks as even the homepage requires many
templates to be loaded – and hence many HTTP requests. If I had more
time, I would have pre-loaded the templates required for the homepage,
potentially using the technique from my first attempt above.

### adding efficiency, lazy-loading templates

To make subsequent page transitions faster, I added some code to
templates.coffee.erb to pre-load any remaining templates after 15
seconds – there by allowing the homepage to complete its loading first:

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1

    Frontend.factory('LazyLoadTemplates', ['$templateCache', '$timeout', '$http', ($templateCache, $timeout, $http) ->
      ->
        $timeout( ->
          Object.keys(Frontend.Templates).forEach (logical_name) -> 
            if not $templateCache.get(Frontend.Templates[logical_name])?
              $http.get Frontend.Templates[logical_name], {cache: $templateCache}
        , 15000)
    ])

I then called the `LazyLoadTemplates` function from the `Frontend`
module `run` method so it could be injected with what it needs.

### adding a CDN, dealing with CORS

The next step was to load the templates (as well as the other static
assets) from a CDN such as
[Cloudfront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). Unfortunately for this,
I had to deal with CORS as I was loading the assets via ajax. I say
unfortunately as Angular makes this pretty hard. The problem is that its
template loading code is hardwired to use the `$http` component which is
not setup to handle CORS. The fact that `$http` does not handle CORS is
understandable as CORS imposes too many restrictions for a general HTTP
component. It would be nice if the template loading process was more
configurable/pluggable though.

Complicating matters further was having to support IE 8/9 which rely on
the `XDomainRequest` object.

In the end, I ran out of time to deal with this issue properly, so I
worked around it by only loading the lazily-loaded templates from the
CDN for “modern” browsers. `templates.coffee.erb` the became:

    ])

Thick model, thin controllers
-----------------------------

In most of the “hello world” tutorials, you’ll see all the logic shoved
into the controllers. If you do this on larger applications, you’ll
start to get controllers which resemble a [big ball of
mud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud). Borrowing from the
Rails world, I wanted to structure my code in a similar way as the Rails
does with its controllers and ActiveRecord models. The “rent listing”
model object is shown below:

      sydney_moment = $filter 'sydneyMoment'
      currency_without_cents = $filter 'noFractionCurrency'
      yes_no = $filter 'yesNo'

      quantity_specified = (quanity) -> quanity? and not /^[\s0\.]+$/.test quanity

      RentListing = (data) ->

        is_leased = data.status == "leased"

        now_or_in_the_future = (date) ->
          result = null
          if date?
            lease_start_date = new timezoneJS.Date date, 'Australia/Sydney'
            now = new timezoneJS.Date 'Australia/Sydney'
            result = if lease_start_date > now then sydney_moment(date, 'dddd D MMMM') else 'Now'

          result

        angular.extend(ListingDetails(data),

          rent_per_week: currency_without_cents data.price_display_min

          show_inspection_times: not is_leased and data.next_opening_times? and data.next_opening_times.length > 0

          bond_specified: quantity_specified data.bond
          bond: currency_without_cents data.bond

          furnished_specified: quantity_specified data.furnished
          furnished: yes_no data.furnished

          pets_specified: quantity_specified data.pets_allowed
          pets_allowed: yes_no data.pets_allowed
        )

      RentListing.find = (property_id, preview_hash) ->
        config =
          url: "/frontend/rent/rent_listings/#{property_id}"
          method: 'GET'

        if preview_hash
          config.params =
            preview_hash: preview_hash

        $http(config).then(
          (response) -> RentListing(response.data)
          (response) -> $q.reject response.data.error
        )

      RentListing
    ])

The corresponding controller is:

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2

~~~~

    Frontend.RentListingController = ($scope, $routeParams, RentListing) ->

      $scope.rent_listing = RentListing.find $routeParams.listing_id, $routeParams.preview_hash

    Frontend.RentListingController.$inject = ['$scope', '$routeParams', 'RentListing']

In general, my controllers only did the folling types of things:

-   attached data to the scope, making it available to the view
-   handled routing logic such as redirects or back-button functionality
-   a little view-only logic such as hover states and the like

Model objects followed the pattern shown for the “rent listing” example
above, ie they had:

-   a constructor function which used normal javascript closure to add
    methods to data (from the server-side)
-   “static” functions (e.g. `RentListing.find`) to retrieve data from
    the server using the `$http` service and which called the constuctor
    function

The model contructor functions could then be tested in isolation to the
ajax interactions and view-controller.

In order to resuse code between model objects, I injected the “common”
constructor fuction and used it as a template with `angular.extend`. As
there weren’t that many objects, I didn’t bother with prototypal
inheritance. For a more complete guide of how to reuse code in
javascript, I greatly recomend [Eric Elliot’s
post](http://ericleads.com/2013/02/fluent-javascript-three-different-kinds-of-prototypal-oo/)
on the subject.

IE 8 gotchas
------------

In addition to following the advice on the [Angular.js
website](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/ie), I found I need to do the
following extra things in order to use “transclude” in my directives:

-   I needed to set `replace = true`
-   I needed to use the attribute form rather than the element form of
    the directive.

Luckilly, other than that things worked okay on IE 8.

Conclusion
----------

I would be happy to use Angular.js again on future projects. It provides
many things which aid the structure of a thick browser app:

-   dependency injection
-   ansychronous IO with promises
-   directives – which allow encapsulation of HTML and javascript

My only complaint is the size of Angular.js – both in terms of bytes and
the number of features. As an example, Angular.js comes with jqLite (low
footprint version of jQuery) but I needed more than it provided, so I
ended up including jQuery anyway. I nearly ran into the same issue with
it’s lightweight $q promises service as it lacked a few functions such
as map/reduce.

Apparently, Angular.js has had a great influence on the feature
pipelines for the major browsers. As more features are implemented
natively, the library itself should get a lot smaller.

Can Angular.js become the “Rails” of the browser world?
