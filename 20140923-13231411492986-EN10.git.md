I accidentally added the wrong directory containing my files in
[Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29). Instead of
adding a `.java` file, I added the directory containing the `.class`
file.

How can I undo this action?

If you're working in DOS, instead of `git reset --soft HEAD^` you'll
need to use `git reset --soft HEAD~1`. The \^ is a continuation
character in DOS so it won't work properly. Also, `--soft` is the
default, so you can omit it if you like and just say `git reset HEAD~1`.

(Correction to what I wrote above; `--mixed` is the default. `--mixed`
means to keep the changed files, but not keep them in the index.
`--soft` would keep the changed files and keep them in the index as they
were just before the changed commit. Sorry for the confusion.) –

Undoing a commit is a little scary if you don't know how it works. But
it's actually amazingly easy if you do understand.

Say you have this, where C is your HEAD and (F) is the state of your
files.

       (F)
    A-B-C
        ↑
      master

You want to **nuke commit C and never see it again**. You do this:

    git reset --hard HEAD~1

The result is:

     (F)
    A-B
      ↑
    master

Now B is the HEAD. Because you used `--hard`, your files are reset to
their state at commit B.

Ah, but suppose commit C wasn't a disaster, but just a bit off. You want
to **undo the commit but keep your changes** for a bit of editing before
you do a better commit. Starting again from here, with C as your HEAD:

       (F)
    A-B-C
        ↑
      master

You can do this, leaving off the `--hard`:

    git reset HEAD~1

In this case the result is:

       (F)
    A-B-C
      ↑
    master

In both cases, HEAD is just a pointer to the latest commit. When you do
a `git reset HEAD~1`, you tell Git to move the HEAD pointer back one
commit. But (unless you use `--hard`) you leave your files as they were.
So now `git status` shows the changes you had checked into C. You
haven't lost a thing!

For the lightest touch, you can even **undo your commit but leave your
files and your index**:

    git reset --soft HEAD~1

This not only leaves your files alone, it even leaves your *index*
alone. When you do `git status`, you'll see that the same files are in
the index as before. In fact, right after this command, you could do
`git commit` and you'd be redoing the same commit you just had.

One more thing: **Suppose you destroy a commit** as in the first
example, **but then discover you needed it after all**? Tough luck,
right?

Nope, there's *still* a way to get it back. Type `git reflog` and you'll
see a list of (partial) commit shas that you've moved around in. Find
the commit you destroyed, and do this:

    git checkout -b someNewBranchName shaYouDestroyed

You've now resurrected that commit. Commits don't actually get destroyed
in Git for some 90 days, so you can usually go back and rescue one you
didn't mean to get rid of.

@dma\_k, yes. Or you could do `git reset --hard HEAD^^` once. I use the
tilde (\~) notation because the caret (\^) notation doesn't work in DOS.

@Adam, what commit are you trying to undo? The *first* commit? If you're
trying to undo the first commit and go back to zero commits, the easiest
thing would probably be to delete the repository (but not your code) and
create it again. – [Kyralessa](/users/5486/kyralessa "80058 reputation")

For a git beginner, it isn't obvious what the difference is between the
last two options (--soft and the one above it). Mentioning the index
doesn't help, we don't really know what that means yet. @nessur's
connection between soft and Ctrl-Z really helped! But I still don't
quite understand the difference between the two options. –

Add/remove files to get things the way you want:

    git rm classdir
    git add sourcedir

Then amend the commit:

    git commit --amend

The previous, erroneous commit will be edited to reflect the new index
state - in other words, it'll be like you never made the mistake in the
first place :)

Note that you should only do this if you haven't pushed yet. If you have
pushed, then you'll just have to commit a fix normally.

@dbm, if you accidentally amended, use `git reset --soft <oldref>`,
where oldref is the commit ID before the amend. You can use `git reflog`
to identify the old commit ID. This will undo the effects of the amend,
but leave changes staged. Then just do `git commit` to commit as a
regular commit. – [bdonlan](/users/36723/bdonlan "92163 reputation") May

If you're foolish and don't think carefully you can lose staged changes
with this approach. The accepted is more explicit and safer. Kyralessa's

really happening. –

@Dennis, git commit --amend turns the current tree (ie, staged changes)
into a commit, overwriting current HEAD. After that point, they're not
considered staged anymore because they're part of the commit (ie, git
diff --cached is blank), but they're not "removed" or "lost". –

This took me a while to figure out, so maybe this will help someone...

There are two ways to "undo" your last commit, depending on whether or
not you have already made your commit public (pushed to your remote
repository):

How to undo a local commit
--------------------------

Lets say I committed locally, but now want to remove that commit.

    git log
        commit 101: bad commit    # latest commit, this would be called 'HEAD'
        commit 100: good commit   # second to last commit, this is the one we want

To restore everything back to the way it was prior to the last commit,
we need to `reset` to the commit before `HEAD`:

    git reset --soft HEAD^     # use --soft if you want to keep your changes
    git reset --hard HEAD^     # use --hard if you don't care about keeping the changes you made

Now `git log` will show that our last commit has been removed.

How to undo a public commit
---------------------------

If you have already made your commits public, you will want to create a
new commit which will "revert" the changes you made in your previous
commit (current HEAD).

    git revert HEAD

Your changes will now be reverted and ready for you to commit:

    git commit -m 'restoring the file I removed on accident'
    git log
        commit 102: restoring the file I removed on accident
        commit 101: removing a file we dont need
        commit 100: adding a file that we need

Revert](http://book.git-scm.com/4_undoing_in_git_-_reset,_checkout_and_revert.html)

or

    git reset --hard HEAD~1

**Warning: The above command will permanently remove the modifications
to the `.java` files (and any other files) that you wanted to commit.**

The hard reset to HEAD-1 will set your working copy to the state of the
commit before your wrong commit.

You can "git stash save" working copy changes, do a hard reset and then
"git stash pop" to get them back, though I suppose a soft reset would be
simpler. – [Asad R.](/users/138881/asad-r "698 reputation") Apr 15 '11

Replace the files in the index:

    git rm --cached file.class
    git add file.java

Then, if it's a private branch, **amend** the commit:

    git commit --amend

Or, if it's a shared branch, make a new commit:

    git commit -m 'Replace .class files with .java files'

* * * * *

You may also want to add `*.class` to a
[gitignore](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files) to stop
this happening again.

If you committed to the wrong branch: once reverted, switch to the
correct branch and cherry-pick the commit. –

If you have [Git Extras](https://github.com/visionmedia/git-extras)
installed, you can run `git undo` to undo the latest commit.
`git undo 3` will undo the last 3 commits.

I wanted to undo the lastest 5 commits in our shared repository. I
looked up the revision id that I wanted to rollback to. Then I typed in
the following.

    prompt> git reset --hard 5a7404742c85
    HEAD is now at 5a74047 Added one more page to catalogue
    prompt> git push origin master --force
    Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    remote: bb/acl: neoneye is allowed. accepted payload.
    To git@bitbucket.org:thecompany/prometheus.git

Rewriting history on a shared repository is generally a very bad idea. I
assume you know what you're doing, I just hope future readers do too. –

Yes rollback is dangerous. Make sure that your working copy is in the
desired state before you push. When pushing then the unwanted commits
gets deleted permanently. –

fantastic. This worked like a charm. There should be a git option for
independently working developers - where one can use GitX, or a delete
button next to a commit, and a confirmation - so this process is not so
enigmatic :) –

If you are planning undoing a local commit entirely, whatever you
changes you did on the commit, and if you don't worry anything about
that, just do the following command.

    git reset --hard HEAD^1

(This command will ignore your entire commit and your changes will be
lost completely from your local working tree). If you want undo your
commit, but you want changes you did on the commit into the staging area
(before commit just like after `git add` called the staging area) then
do the following command.

    git reset --soft HEAD^1

Now your committed files comes into the staging area. Suppose if you
want to unstage the files, because you need to edit some wrong conent,
then do the following command

    git reset HEAD

Now committed files come from the staged area into the unstaged area.
Now files are ready to edit, so whatever you changes, you want go edit
and added it and make a fresh/new commit.

I prefer to use `git rebase` for this job, because a nice list pops up
where I can choose the commits to get rid of. It might not be as direct
as some other answers here, but it just feels "right".

Choose how many commits you want to list, then invoke like this

    git rebase -i HEAD~3

Sample list

    pick aa28ba7 Sanity check for RtmpSrv port
    pick c26c541 RtmpSrv version option
    pick 58d6909 Better URL decoding support

Then git will remove commits for any line that you remove.

How to fix the previous local commit
------------------------------------

Use git-gui (or similar) to perform a `git commit --amend`. From the GUI
you can add or remove individual files from the commit. You can also
modify the commit message.

How to undo the previous local commit
-------------------------------------

Just reset your branch to the previous location (for example, using
`gitk` or `git rebase`). Then reapply your changes from a saved copy.
After garbage collection in your local repository, it will be like the
unwanted commit never happened. To do all of that in a single command,
use `git reset HEAD~1`.

**Word of warning**: *Careless use of `git reset` is a good way to get
your working copy into a confusing state. I recommend that Git novices
avoid this if they can.*

How to undo a public commit
---------------------------

Perform a [reverse cherry
pick](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1624724/86967)
([git-revert](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert.html)) to undo the
changes.

If you haven't yet pulled other changes onto your branch, you can simply
do...

    git revert --no-edit HEAD

Then push your updated branch to the shared repository.

**How to undo the last Git commit?**

To restore everything back to the way it was prior to the last commit,
we need to reset to the commit before HEAD.

1.  If you don't want to keep your changes that you made:

        git reset --hard HEAD^

2.  If you want to keep your changes:

        git reset --soft HEAD^

Now check your git log, it will show that our last commit has been
removed.

Use reflog to find a correct state

    git reflog

![reflog before](http://i.stack.imgur.com/c7e7D.png) *REFLOG BEFORE
RESET*

Select the correct reflog (f3cb6e2 in my case) and type

    git reset --hard f3cb6e2

After that the repo HEAD will be reset to that HEADid ![reset
effect](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GdnDT.png) *LOG AFTER RESET*

Finally the reflog looks like the picture below

If you want to permanently undo it and you have cloned some repository

The commit id can be seen by

    git log 

Then you can do -

    git reset --hard <commit_id>

    git push origin <branch_name> -f

On [SourceTree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/overview)
(GUI for GitHub), you may right-click the commit and do a 'Reverse
Commit'. This should undo your changes.

On the terminal:

You may alternatively use:

    git revert

Or:

~~~~ {.lang-bash .prettyprint-override}
git reset --soft HEAD^ # Use --soft if you want to keep your changes.
git reset --hard HEAD^ # Use --hard if you don't care about keeping your changes.

This **article** has an **excellent explanation** as to how to go
**about various scenarios** (where a commit has been done as well as the
push OR just a commit, before the push):

[http://christoph.ruegg.name/blog/git-howto-revert-a-commit-already-pushed-to-a-remote-reposit.html](http://christoph.ruegg.name/blog/git-howto-revert-a-commit-already-pushed-to-a-remote-reposit.html)

From the article, the **easiest command** I saw to **revert a previous
commit by its commit id**, was:

    git revert dd61ab32

Another way:

Checkout the branch you want to revert, then reset your local working
copy back to the commit that you want to be the latest one on the remote
server (everything after it will go bye-bye). To do this, in SourceTree
I right-clicked on the and selected "Reset BRANCHNAME to this commit".

Then navigate to your repository's local directory and run this command:

    git -c diff.mnemonicprefix=false -c core.quotepath=false push -v -f --tags REPOSITORY_NAME BRANCHNAME:BRANCHNAME

This will erase all commits after the current one in your local
repository but only for that one branch.

In my case I accidentally committed some files I did not want to. So I
did the following and it worked:

    git reset --soft HEAD^
    git rm --cached [files you do not need]
    git add [files you need]
    git commit -c ORIG_HEAD

Verify the results with gitk or git log --stat

### For a local commit

    git reset --soft HEAD~1

or if you do not remember exactly in which commit it is, you might use

    git rm --cached <file>

### For a pushed commit

The proper way of removing files from the repository history is using
`git filter-branch`. That is,

~~~~ {.lang-bash .prettyprint-override}
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached <file>' HEAD
~~~~

But I recomnend you use this command with care. Read more at
*[git-filter-branch(1) Manual
Page](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-filter-branch.html)*.

So many answers and nobody mentions the easiest,
[GUI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) based
solution:

`git citool` (or git gui).

Open `git citool`, choose `amend last commit`, click on the file you
added to undo that, then click on the file you really wanted to add and
click commit. You can update the commit message if you want. This is of
course only for local commits.

There is two main scenarios

**You didn't pushed the commit yet**

If the problem was extra files you commited (and you don't want those on
repository), you can remove them using git rm and then commiting with
**--amend**

    git rm <pathToFile>

You can also remove entire directories with -r, or even combine with
other bash commands

    git rm -r <pathToDirectory>
    git rm $(find -name '*.class')

After removing the files, you can commit, with **--amend** option

    git commit --amend -C HEAD # the -C option is to use the same commit message

This will rewrite your recent local commit removing the extra files, so,
these files will never be sent on push and also will be removed from
your local .git repo by GC

**You already pushed the commit**

You can apply the same solution of the other scenario and then doing git
push with -f option, but it is **not recommended** since it overwrite
the remote history with divergent change (it can mess your repo)

Instead, you have to do the commit without --amend (remember this about
-amend, that option rewrites the history on last commit)
