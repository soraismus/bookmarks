Reuters

For years, I've been making the same embarrassing mistake about U.S.
economic inequality. Sorry.

I've written, over and over, that the most important divide in our
wealth disparity was between the 1 percent and the 99 percent. For
example, when I compared the evolution in investment income since the
late 1970s, I often imagined a graph like this from the Economic Policy
Institute, showing the 1 percent flying away from the rest of the
country.

It turns out that that graph is somewhat misleading. It makes it look
like the 1 percent is a group of similar households accelerating from
the rest of the economy, holding hands, in unison. Nothing could be
further from the truth.

A few weeks ago, I
[shared](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/02/the-rise-and-rise-and-rise-of-the-001-percent-in-america/283793/)
this graph (from the [World Top Incomes
Database](http://topincomes.g-mond.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/#Graphic:))
showing how the top 0.01 percent—that's the one percent of the 1
percent—was leaving the rest of the top percentile behind.

It's even more egregious than that. An amazing chart from economist
[Amir
Sufi](http://houseofdebt.org/2014/03/29/measuring-wealth-inequality.html),
based on the work of Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, shows that when
you look inside the 1 percent, you see clearly that most of them aren't
growing their share of wealth at all. In fact, the gain in wealth share
is all about the top 0.1 percent of the country. While nine-tenths of
the top percentile hasn't seen much change at all since 1960, the 0.01
percent has *essentially* *quadrupled* its share of the country's wealth
in half a century.

![image](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/houseofdebt_SaezZucman21.png)

It turns out that wealth inequality isn't about the 1 percent v. the 99
percent at all. It's about the 0.1 percent v. the 99.9 percent (or,
really, the 0.01 percent vs. the 99.99 percent, if you like).
Long-story-short is that this group, comprised mostly of bankers and
CEOs, is [riding the stock market to pick up extraordinary investment
income](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/02/the-rise-and-rise-and-rise-of-the-001-percent-in-america/283793/).
And it's this investment income, rather than ordinary earned income,
that's creating this extraordinary wealth gap.

The 0.1 percent isn't the same group of people every year. There's
considerable churn at the tippy-top. For example, consider the
["Fortunate 400,"](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/08intop400.pdf) the
IRS's annual list of the 400 richest tax returns in the country. Between
1992 and 2008, 3,672 different taxpayers appeared on the Fortunate 400
list. Just one percent of the Fortunate 400—four households—appeared on
the list all 17 years.

Now there's your real 1 percent.
