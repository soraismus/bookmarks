The Return Of The One-Room Schoolhouse

The West Street Schoolhouse in Southington, Ct., was built around 1760.
It was heated with a potbellied wood stove.

National Register of Historic Places

Even if your grandpa didn't walk uphill to school both ways, or have to
break the ice on the bucket before fetching a drink with the dipper, you
probably have iconic images in your mind of the one-room schoolhouse.
It's a storied piece of America's past dating back to the Colonial era.

But in most of America, the idea of students of all ages learning in a
single classroom, with a single teacher, has long been as dated as the
donkey cart. Urbanization, the advent of the school bus, and the quest
to standardize and upgrade education spelled doom for the one-room
school in the last century.

"Modern roads, modern transportation and modern minds open to the
future, cannot tolerate the condition that attends the one-teacher
school," wrote the *Tuscaloosa News* in 1931. At that time there were
still a reported 150,000 such schools nationwide. "Their abolition is
certain and every decrease in their number means increased intelligence
for the children of the present and of posterity."

Well, as with many things in life, old can suddenly become new again.
Today, the "micro-school" is being touted as an important model for
creating innovative, personalized learning experiences. Such an
environment, the thinking goes, can ease the creation of close
relationships among teachers and students. And it can provide an easy
venue for experimentation.

Matt Candler founded [4.0
Schools](https://mail.npr.org/owa/redir.aspx?C=dE-FRyx33UuyYzcgPjhW8cmvmpR_adEIHJbEgaC_LXnyTdY9_OAImLvdtGK4Anj5V457g9DFxYU.&URL=http%3a%2f%2f4pt0.org%2f),
a New Orleans-based incubator that helps launch for-profit and nonprofit
education ventures, including [mSchool,](http://mschools.org/) which
establishes small "pop-up classrooms" with online curricula in community
centers. He wrote recently about the return of the micro-school.

"I think there's such a massive demand for better options public and
private," Candler tells me. "I think it's very likely you'll see a
NOLA-launched micro- school, if not a wave of them."

For much of the 20th century, schools got bigger, not smaller. And there
were good reasons for it, like reducing costs and making greater use of
diverse teacher expertise.

But now, software and Internet connectivity are nudging the cost of a
broader, high-quality curriculum toward zero. You don't necessarily need
a dedicated Swahili teacher to teach Swahili. Candler and others believe
the costs of large schools are starting to outweigh their benefits.

These micro-schools take many forms. Enrollment can range from a few
students to a few dozen. Some, like the Tiny School in Abilene, Texas,
are simply collectives of home-schooling families who get together and
hire a teacher. "We decided if we could get through the first year, and
[our daughter] Mary thought school was a good place to be, we would have
succeeded," says Matthew Lowe, who started Tiny School last year with
six kindergarten students, three days a week, in a borrowed church. This
year, the school will have three mixed-age classrooms with three
teachers. "After the year was over, the kids were disappointed and asked
when they could start again," Lowe said. "That seemed like a pretty good
sign."

Others, like [Brightworks in San
Francisco](https://mail.npr.org/owa/redir.aspx?C=dE-FRyx33UuyYzcgPjhW8cmvmpR_adEIHJbEgaC_LXnyTdY9_OAImLvdtGK4Anj5V457g9DFxYU.&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sfbrightworks.org%2f),
the [Brooklyn Apple
Academy](https://mail.npr.org/owa/redir.aspx?C=dE-FRyx33UuyYzcgPjhW8cmvmpR_adEIHJbEgaC_LXnyTdY9_OAImLvdtGK4Anj5V457g9DFxYU.&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.brooklynappleacademy.org%2f)
and [Acton
Academy](https://mail.npr.org/owa/redir.aspx?C=dE-FRyx33UuyYzcgPjhW8cmvmpR_adEIHJbEgaC_LXnyTdY9_OAImLvdtGK4Anj5V457g9DFxYU.&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.actonacademy.org%2f)
in Austin, largely follow the vision of one educator, be it
project-based learning, an arts focus or the Socratic method.
Brightworks founder Gever Tulley coined the term "hyper-local
micro-school."

Micro-schools can transcend the isolation of those rural cabins of yore
with social media and digital resources, field trips and visiting
experts arriving by Google Hangout. Supporters say they can function as
small nodes in a global learning network. That's the vision of
[alt.school](https://mail.npr.org/owa/redir.aspx?C=dE-FRyx33UuyYzcgPjhW8cmvmpR_adEIHJbEgaC_LXnyTdY9_OAImLvdtGK4Anj5V457g9DFxYU.&URL=https%3a%2f%2fwww.altschool.com%2f),
a startup founded by a former Google employee that has raised a reported
$33 million in venture capital. Alt.school will open micro-schools in
four different San Francisco neighborhoods this fall. Each features from
one to four mixed-age classrooms. The schools will share a single
software platform that creates a personalized learning plan for each
student and helps measure their progress. Alt.school boasts a team of
researchers and will enlist teachers in conducting classroom experiments
for "continuous improvement." The company's business plan calls for it
to expand nationwide.

Among public schools, where funding is a perennial issue and class size
a perennial lament, the one-room schoolhouse is a dwindling species.
[NPR reported in
2005](https://mail.npr.org/owa/redir.aspx?C=dE-FRyx33UuyYzcgPjhW8cmvmpR_adEIHJbEgaC_LXnyTdY9_OAImLvdtGK4Anj5V457g9DFxYU.&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.npr.org%2ftemplates%2fstory%2fstory.php%3fstoryId%3d5064420)that
there were fewer than 400 left. Maybe the micro-school could, ahem, make
the idea big again.
