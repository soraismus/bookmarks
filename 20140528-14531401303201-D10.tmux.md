There are 4,257 tutorials on tmux. That's a rough number that I just
made up. This one is designed to take you from "wtf tmux" to "omg tmux"
with extreme haste.

Let's get started.

Why Tmux
--------

`tmux` is useful to people in different ways. To me, it's most useful as
a way to maintain persistent working states on remote servers—allowing
you to detach and re-attach at will.

You could, for example, have a session on your server for hacking on a
node REST API (my current project), and call it "nodeapi". And let us
say that you are compiling something for it that will take two hours
(work with me), but you're currently working at a coffee shop and you
have to leave. `tmux` lets you simply detach from that session and come
back to it later.

That's handy.

Others like to focus on how you can use tmux to have multiple panes
within multiple windows within multiple tabs within multiple sessions. I
don't do that. I like fewer of those—as few as possible, actually—and
this guide will be focused on a simple *persistent-remote-sessions*
model.

#### A remote computing lifestyle

Mobility is a central theme for tmux users. Many developers do all of
their work from the server, and simply connect in from `$wherever` to do
it. `tmux` (and similar tools) allow you to work from a coffee shop in
SF, start something building on the server, disconnect to take a flight,
and then pick up that same task on the ground in NYC when you land.

A related advantage to this mobile approach is the fact that your client
machine is not too terribly important. You can upgrade your laptop,
clone a repo with your vim/tmux dotfiles in it, and you're back to your
optimum computing environment in minutes rather than days.

Anyway, those are some reasons that people love tmux, but you don't have
to make this lifestyle change in order to see its benefits.

### What about screen?

Good question. `tmux` is a lot like screen, only better. The short
answer for *how* it's better is that tmux is better designed to perform
the same functions. Screen gets you there (kind of) but does so
precariously.

Here are a few of the key advantages of tmux over screen:

-   Screen is a largely dead project, and its code has significant
    issues
-   Tmux is an active project with an active codebase
-   Tmux is built to be truly client/server; screen emulates this
    behavior
-   Tmux supports both emacs and vim shortcuts
-   Tmux supports auto-renaming windows
-   Tmux is highly scriptable
-   Window splitting is more advanced in tmux

Enough about that. Use tmux.

Basics
------

Now is a good time to mention that there is a universal tmux shortcut
that lets you quickly perform many tasks.

### The `tmux` shortcut

By default, tmux uses `Ctrl-b` as its shortcut activation chord, which
enables you perform a number of functions quickly. Here are a few of the
basics:

First you hit:

$ Ctrl-b

…followed by a number of options that we'll talk about below. But get
ready to use that `Ctrl-b` combo. Also consider remapping CAPSLOCK to
CONTROL within your operating system; it makes the pinky walk for
`Ctrl-b` quite nice.

### Invocation

Right then. Let's start by running `tmux`. You want to do this from the
system that you want to detach and re-attach to—which for me is usually
a remote server.

$ tmux

Simple enough. You now have a tmux session open that you can disconnect
from and come back to later.

### Show Sessions

Since the idea of tmux is having multiple sessions open, and being able
to disconnect and reconnect to them as desired, we need to be able to
see them quickly.

\# Via shortcut (by default `Ctrl-b`)

$ Ctrl-b s

\# Via tmux command

$ tmux ls

Either way you get the same thing:

~~~~ {.codeblock}
0: 1 windows (created Thu Nov 28 06:12:52 2013) [80x24] (attached)
~~~~

### Create a new session

Now we're going to create a new session. You can do this with just the
*new* command, or by providing an argument to it that serves as the
session name. I recommend providing a session name, since organization
is rather the point of tmux.

$ tmux new -s session-name

\# Without naming the new session (not recommended)

$ tmux new

### Attaching to an existing session

Since we're going to be creating sessions with names, and we may have
more than one, we want to be able to attach to them properly. There are
a couple ways of doing this.

You can simply type `tmux a` and it'll connect you to the first
available session.

$ tmux a

Or you can attach to a specific session by providing an argument.

$ tmux a -t session-name

### Detaching from a session

You can detach from an existing session (so you can come back to it
later) by sending the *detach* command.

$ tmux detach

Or you can use the shortcut.

$ Ctrl-b d

### Killing a session

There are times when you'll want to destroy a session. This can be done
using the following syntax, which is much the same as attachment:

$ tmux kill-session -t session-name

[ **NOTE**: You can kill windows the same way, but using `kill-window`
instead. You can also kill tmux altogether with `killall tmux`. ]

Configuration
-------------

As with most things in tech, you can get pretty silly with your tmux
config. The common things to tinker with are:

-   The primary `tmux` shortcut
-   Your status bar
-   Your various keyboard shortcuts

I went pretty Spartan with mine.

~~~~ {.codeblock}
# Set a Ctrl-b shortcut for reloading your tmux config
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf

# Rename your terminals
set -g set-titles on
set -g set-titles-string '#(whoami)::#h::#(curl ipecho.net/plain;echo)'

# Status bar customization
set -g status-utf8 on
set -g status-bg black
set -g status-fg white
set -g status-interval 5
set -g status-left-length 90
set -g status-right-length 60
set -g status-left "#[fg=Green]#(whoami)#[fg=white]::#[fg=blue] \
##(hostname - s)#[fg=white]::##[fg=yellow]#(curl ipecho.net/plain;echo)"
set -g status-justify left
set -g status-right '#[fg=Cyan]#S #[fg=white]%a %d %b %R' 
~~~~

One thing worth noting here is that I use ipecho.net to get my current
WAN IP4 WAN address instead of icanhazip as most other tutorials have.
It's just faster and less prone to error, from my experience.

[ My current, updated configuration can be found
[here](https://raw.github.com/danielmiessler/tmux/master/.tmux.config)
if you're interested. ]

Advanced
--------

That covers how I usually use `tmux`, but I do often make use of some of
the more powerful features.

### Windows and Panes

![tmuxpanes](/images/tmuxpanes.png)

One of these features is the ability to break your session into more
discreet components, called windows and panes. These are good for
organizing multiple varied activities in a logical way.

Let's look at how they relate to each other.

#### Nesting

![tmuxnesting](/images/tmuxnesting.png)

`tmux` sessions have windows, and windows have panes. Below you can see
how how I conceptualize them—although if anyone has a more authoritative
or useful hierarchy I'll happily embrace it.

-   **Sessions** are for an overall *theme*, such as *work*, or
    *experimentation*, or *sysadmin*.
-   **Windows** are for *projects* within that theme. So perhaps within
    your *experimentation* session you have a window titled
    *noderestapi*, and one titled *lua sample.*
-   **Panes** are for *views* within your current project. So within
    your *sysadmin* session, which has a *logs* window, you may have a
    few panes for access logs, error logs, and system logs.

It's also possible to create panes within a session without first
creating a separate window. I do this sometimes. Hopefully it isn't as
horrible as it sounds right after reading about nesting. As I said in
the beginning, I incline towards simplicity with my use of `tmux`.

#### Navigating with panes

There's a default way to navigate between panes, but I don't know what
it is. I'm a [vim](http://www.danielmiessler.com/study/vim) guy, so I
navigate within my panes using the *h*, *j*, *k*, and *l* keys like so:

~~~~ {.codeblock}
# Remap window navigation to vim
unbind-key j
bind-key j select-pane -D
unbind-key k
bind-key k select-pane -U
unbind-key h
bind-key h select-pane -L
unbind-key l
bind-key l select-pane -R
~~~~

Recommendations
---------------

A few thoughts that may help you in your `tmux` travels:

1.  Consider using as few sessions and windows as possible. Humans
    aren't as good at multitasking as we think we are, and while it
    feels powerful to have 47 panes open it's usually not as functional
    as you'd imagine.
2.  When you do use windows and panes, take the time to name them. They
    are indeed useful, but switching between sessions and windows is
    supremely annoying when they're all labeled 0, 1, and 2.
3.  Start with a basic config and get used to it before you get silly.
    I've seen multiple people spend hours configuring vim or tmux only
    to confuse themselves and abandon the project altogether. Start
    simple.
