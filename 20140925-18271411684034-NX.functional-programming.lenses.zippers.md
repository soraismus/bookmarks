This is an example of using a zipper in Haskell:

    data Tree a = Fork (Tree a) (Tree a) | Leaf a
    data Cxt a = Top | L (Cxt a) (Tree a) | R (Tree a) (Cxt a)
    type Loc a = (Tree a, Cxt a)

    left :: Loc a -> Loc a
    left (Fork l r, c) = (l, L c r)

    right :: Loc a -> Loc a
    right (Fork l r, c) = (r, R l c)

    top :: Tree a -> Loc a 
    top t = (t, Top)

    up :: Loc a -> Loc a
    up (t, L c r) = (Fork t r, c)
    up (t, R l c) = (Fork l t, c)

    upmost :: Loc a -> Loc a
    upmost l@(t, Top) = l
    upmost l = upmost (up l)

    modify :: Loc a -> (Tree a -> Tree a) -> Loc a
    modify (t, c) f = (f t, c)

This is an example of using a zipper in Clojure:

    (use 'clojure.zip)
    (require '[clojure.zip :as z])

    user> (def z [[1 2 3] [4 [5 6] 7] [8 9]])
    #'user/z

    user> (def zp (zipper vector? seq (fn [_ c] c) z))
    #'user/zp

    user> zp
    [[[1 2 3] [4 [5 6] 7] [8 9]] nil]

    user> (-> zp down)
    [[1 2 3] {:l [], :pnodes [[[1 2 3] [4 [5 6] 7] [8 9]]], :ppath nil, :r ([4 [5 6] 7] [8 9])}]

    user> (first (-> zp down))
    [1 2 3]

This is an example of using a Lens in Haskell:

    data Person = P { name :: String 
                    , addr :: Address 
                    }
    data Address = A { street :: String
                     , city :: String
                     , postcode :: String 
                     }

    setPostcode :: String -> Person -> Person
    setPostcode pc p = p { addr = addr p { postcode = pc }}

This is an example of using a Lens in Clojure.

    (use 'lens)

    (defrecord Address [street city postcode])
    (defrecord Person [name age address])
    (defrecord User [uid username identity password])

    (def -postcode (mklens :postcode))
    (def -city (mklens :city))
    (def -street (mklens :street))
    (def -address (mklens :address))
    (def -age (mklens :age))
    (def -name (mklens :name))
    (def -uid (mklens :uid))
    (def -username (mklens :username))
    (def -identity (mklens :identity))
    (def -password (mklens :password))

    (-get -postcode home)

    (-set -postcode home 500)

Now it seems both lenses and zippers are functional ways of traversing
nested data structures.

My question is: **What are the differences between lenses and zippers?**
Is one suited to a particular use case?

You can move around in zippers? In general zippers have 'go left', 'go
up', etc primitives; you can't normally move a lens a bit to the left.
They are closely related though. –

A lens is just conceptually a getter/setter pair that can go arbitrarily
deep into a data structure (it's actually even a little more general
than this). A zipper is a specific kind of data structure where you can
(at least) move left and right/up and down. – [David

Zippers are akin to cursors: they allow to traverse trees in an
*ordered* manner. Their usual operations are `up`, `down`, `left`,
`right` and `edit`. (names may vary depending on impl)

Lenses are some sort of generalized keys (as in "keys of an associative
datastructure"). The structure does not need to be ordered. Their usual
operations are `fetch` and `putback` and are very similar to `get` and
`assoc`. (names may vary depending on impl)

So as you see zippers are very much concerned about hierarchy (up/down)
and order (left/right) while lenses are just about focusing (hence the
name) on a piece of data, which may even be a projection (that is
something that didn't existed on its own in the original structure).

For example in my ongoing work on
[Enliven](https://github.com/cgrand/enliven), I have lenses that allow
me to focus on a single class or style attribute in a HTML document.

Zippers are a variant of a datatype which unfolds the type into its
*local context* and its *extents* in all directions. Atop a Zipper you
can implement efficient *motion* and *local update*.

Lenses are first class examinations of a particular component of a data
type. They focus on 0, 1, or many subparts of a data structure. Notably,
your example of a lens in Haskell is not actually a lens—it's not first
class.

It's perfectly reasonable to build a lens which focuses on some part of
a zipper. For instance, an even simpler zipper than your examples is a
Cons list zipper

    data Cons a = Empty | Cons a (Cons a)

    data ConsZ a = ConsZ { lefts :: Cons a; here :: a; rights :: Cons a }

    zip :: Cons a -> Maybe (ConsZ a)
    zip Empty = Nothing
    zip (Cons a as) = ConsZ Empty a as

    unzip :: ConsZ a -> Cons a
    unzip (ConsZ Empty a as) = Cons a as
    unzip (ConsZ (Cons l ls) a as) = unzip (ConsZ ls) l (Cons a as)

We can incrementally modify this structure, moving the focus left or
right

    moveRight :: ConsZ a -> Maybe (ConsZ a)
    moveRight (ConsZ _ _ Empty) = Nothing
    moveRight (ConsZ ls x (Cons a as)) =  ConsZ (Cons x ls) a as

and modify the current local point

    modify :: (a -> a) -> ConsZ a -> ConsZ a
    modify f (ConsZ ls x rs) = ConsZ ls (f x) rs

We can also build lenses which access each part of the zipper structure

    type Lens s a = forall f . Functor f => (a -> f a) -> (s -> f s)

    _lefts :: Lens (ConsZ a) a
    _lenfs inj (ConsZ ls x rs) = (\ls -> ConsZ ls' x rs) <$> inj ls

    _here :: Lens (ConsZ a) a
    _here inj (ConsZ ls x rs) = (\x' -> ConsZ ls x' rs) <$> inj x

And even use them to build our zipper actions effectively

    over :: ((a -> Identity a) -> s -> Identity s) -> (a -> a) -> (s -> s)
    over l f s = runIdentity (l (Identity . f) s)

    modify = over _here

Ultimately, however, a lens is always a first class access to a
particular point in a data structure. They can be composed which gives
the illusion of "motion" in a type, but if you really want that then you
ought to make the zipper transform and use a real zipper type.
