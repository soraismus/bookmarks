[This weird keyboard may be the biggest thing since your standing desk](./)
===========================================================================

**February 11** 2014 – 07:30am

Standing desks are everywhere these days. More and more office workers
are switching over to standing desks, to prevent the [health
problems](//ergo.human.cornell.edu/CUESitStand.html) associated with
sitting.

While it’s great that people are taking healthy computing seriously,
it’s surprising that it’s taken this long for standing to really catch
on, when it seems obvious: if you have legs that work, what good does it
do them to be sitting around all of the time?

### A funny-looking keyboard may be the biggest ergonomics craze since the standing desk

I recently discovered [a
keyboard](//www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Corporation-KB800HMB-US-20-Extended-Freestyle2/dp/B009ZNBJBM/?tag=kadavyinc-20)
which is as good of a fit for the human body as the standing desk. It
looks pretty strange, but I’m personally convinced this is going to be a
very big deal as people get more informed about healthy computing.

[![split keyboard by
kinesys](http://kadavy.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/freestyle-2-20-inch-750x500.jpg)](//www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Corporation-KB800HMB-US-20-Extended-Freestyle2/dp/B009ZNBJBM/?tag=kadavyinc-20)

#### Here’s how your standard keyboard is hurting you

Much more often than you hear people complaining about
computing-work-related problems with their legs, people tend to have
problems with their neck and upper back.

One [study](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19999039) of office workers
found that 56% of workers have neck problems, and 50% have upper back
problems.

![The Trapezius muscles help support your outstretched arms. Good for
hugs.](http://kadavy.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trapezius-273x300.png)

The Trapezius muscles help support your outstretched arms. Good for
hugs.

These problems are often a result of tension in the trapezius muscles.
These muscles connect to your head, spine, and shoulder blade, and help
support your arms.

A big source of this tension is the way we interact with keyboards. When
you use a standard keyboard:

-   You have to get your hands close together to type on the keyboard.
-   To get your hands next to each other, they have to go “around” your
    body, so your arms have to reach out from your body to reach the
    keyboard.
-   Because your arms are now stretched out, your trapezius muscles
    tense to support the weight of your arms.
-   Your shoulders are now forward, so your pectoral muscles are
    shortened.

![Standard keyboards make you reach your arms out & around your
torso.](http://kadavy.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/02standard-224x300.jpg)

Standard keyboards make you reach your arms out & around your torso.

Having this stress on your upper back also makes it easy to slouch. With
this disastrous chain reaction, it’s no wonder that neck and upper back
problems are so common amongst people who do lots of computer work.

### The muscle tension you don’t even know about is cutting off your circulation by 80%

You may think that this is all pretty trivial – that you don’t feel any
tension at all when you’re sitting in front of a standard keyboard. But,
the fact of the matter is that people aren’t even aware of the tension
that is in their muscles.

[Dr. Erik Peper](//biofeedbackhealth.org/) – a healthy computing expert
that has been featured on ABCNews.com and in *GQ*, *Glamour*, and *Men’s
Health* – and his colleagues [recorded the muscle
activity](//biofeedbackhealth.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/making-the-unaware-aware-2013-07-04.pdf)
of subjects while resting, holding their arm in the air, and then while
resting again.

All of the subjects were surprised at just how much activity was going
on in their muscles, even though they thought it felt like nothing at
all to hold their arm up for a few seconds.

#### Your muscles tense without you even knowing it

Look at this chart below, which shows the muscle activity of a clinical
patient. That big spike marked “1” is her muscle activity when she was
simply listening to instructions on what to do.

![Muscle tension is high even when just listening to instructions
(1).](http://kadavy.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/muscle-activity-300x193.png)

Muscle tension is high even when just listening to instructions (1).

Just by thinking about moving her muscles, there was already muscle
activity going on. When she was actually performing the task, the actual
muscle tension (marked “2”) was hardly as intense as when she was just
thinking about performing the task.

As you can see where the chart is marked “3,” muscle tension persisted
even after the task was performed.

By working on computers, not only are we creating tension in our muscles
(that doesn’t quickly subside), we’re too oblivious to what’s going on
with our bodies to even know it, because we’re so focused on the task at
hand.

I called Dr. Peper (no relation to the soft drink) to learn more about
what, exactly, is so bad about about having your muscles tensed 8 hours
a day.

> Muscles, by their very nature, are made to contract and release. But,
> when you tense a muscle, you cut off circulation by as much as 80%.

So, even if you think that reaching around your body to get to your
keyboard isn’t placing tension on your trapezius muscles, it’s probably
more tension than you think, and that tension is cutting off circulation
wherever it occurs.

### Your brain is attacking your trapezius muscles

Not only is the position of your arms with a traditional keyboard
creating tension in your trapezius muscles, the way that you’re
processing information as you’re concentrating on your work is creating
added tension in your trapezius muscles.

Dr. Peper explains, “when you work, you are constantly vigilant. This
state of ‘vigilance’ is heightened by the fact that information hits
your amygdala (the ‘fight or flight’ part of your brain) 22ms faster
than it hits your cortex (the more rational, reasonable part of your
brain).

![Your amygdala is not good for hugs. It gives your "traps" a
beating.](http://kadavy.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Amyg.png)

Your amygdala is not good for hugs. It gives your “traps” a beating.

“You’ve experienced this imbalance in information processing if you’ve
ever said something you regretted in an argument. This imbalance is in
full effect when we’re on a computer, and hyper-focused on a task.”

This “cortex deficit” probably explains YouTube comments. Mystery
solved.

Your trapezius muscles tend to tense when you have the
fight/flight/stress response caused by this “cortex deficit.” So, not
only are your poor shoulders and trapezius muscles in this unfortunate
position all day because of your keyboard, they’re also getting attacked
by your hyper-vigilant amygdala.

It’s no wonder that those chair massages are such a hot commodity at the
Whole Foods. You know, the ones where the masseuse drives his knee into
your upper back to try to undo all of the knots you’ve tied into it?

### Split keyboards help reduce the tension in your shoulders

One of the best ways to reduce tension like this is to improve the
ergonomics of your workstation, and Dr. Peper recommends a split
keyboard for this.

> For almost anybody who doesn’t need a number pad right away, get rid
> of your normal keyboard, and get a split keyboard.

One such keyboard is the [Gold
Touch](//www.amazon.com/Goldtouch-Compact-Size-Adjustable-Keyboard/dp/B0006VJE82?tag=kadavyinc-20),
which is what Dr. Peper uses himself; but for some people – such as
myself – it’s too narrow.

### Try this experiment to see if the “truly split” keyboard is right for you

There are lots of “split” keyboards out there like the Gold Touch, but
you may still have to wrap your arms around your torso a bit to get your
hands on the keys. If you’re more comfortable having your arms by your
sides, then a “truly split” keyboard – one that consists of two
independent pieces – may be better for you.

**Try this experiment:**

-   Put the fingers of your left hand on your right shoulder, where your
    shoulder meets your chest.
-   Now, try putting your right hand on your keyboard, as if you were
    typing.
-   Now, move your right hand to the right, outside your keyboard.
-   Now that your right arm has cleared your body, you can have your
    hand closer to your body. Slide your right hand toward yourself a
    bit.

Did you feel how much your shoulder and chest moved? Did it feel more
natural and comfortable to you? If so, you might like a “truly split”
keyboard, like the [Kinesis Freestyle
2](//www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Corporation-KB800HMB-US-20-Extended-Freestyle2/dp/B009ZNBJBM/?tag=kadavyinc-20).

[![A "truly split" keyboard lets you keep your arms by your sides, where
they
belong.](http://kadavy.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/01standing-split-275x300.jpg)](//www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Corporation-KB800HMB-US-20-Extended-Freestyle2/dp/B009ZNBJBM/?tag=kadavyinc-20)

A “truly split” keyboard lets you keep your arms by your sides, where
they belong.

The Freestyle actually consists of two pieces, which allows you to keep
your hands farther apart. I’m a skinny guy, but since I have totally
insanely ripped shoulders from doing the
[INSANITY®](//www.amazon.com/INSANITY-DVD-Workout-Base-Kit/dp/B002QZ1RS6/?tag=kadavyinc-20)
program, having my hands right in front of my body all of the time
tightens my chest and trapezius muscles, thus building up tension and
restricting my breathing.

### I couldn’t lift my own head

I got up close and personal with sneaky neck and upper back problems
several months ago. I was feeling fine, when all of the sudden, as I
lifted my arms to dry my hair after a shower, a tangle of knots sprang
up in my upper back and neck.

I was in so much pain, almost no position was comfortable. Sitting
upright was too much stress on my neck, lying down hurt because my head
was on my pillow, and I actually had to cradle the back of my head with
my hand just to lift it out of bed.

I couldn’t work, and I had to get a couple high-dollar massages just to
undo the damage. It took two weeks to recover.

At that point, I decided it’s much better for me to have my arms at my
sides when I’m working. This can be true for many types of bodies,
whether your arms need to get around a belly, or if you’re a woman who
has large…impediments…on her chest.

### Your laptop is “a disaster.” The “truly split” keyboard is perfect for the mobile worker.

One of the biggest challenges to having an ergonomic workstation is that
many of us are mobile now. It’s great that we can set up with our laptop
at a coworking station, a cafe, or just on our couch, but that’s the
problem.

Unfortunately, as Dr. Peper puts it, **“A laptop, by definition, is a
disaster.”**

Here’s just a few things that make a laptop an ergonomic nightmare:

-   You put a laptop on…your lap (or a table).
-   Then you have to decide: do you want to crane your neck down at your
    screen, or have the laptop so high that you feel like a
    Tyrannosaurus Rex?
-   You have to put your hands together to type on the unergonomic
    keyboard, which forces you to find a way to get your arms around
    your torso and beyond the trackpad, thus putting stress on your
    trapezius muscles.

Here’s the setup that I like to use when I visit a coworking station
with my laptop:

![split-keyboard-coworking-setup](http://kadavy.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/split-keyboard-coworking-setup-750x561.jpg)

(Dr. Peper notes that facing a window like this causes glare, and isn’t
an ideal setup. Your screen should be perpendicular to any windows.)

-   [Kinesys Freestyle 2
    keyboard](//www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Corporation-KB800HMB-US-20-Extended-Freestyle2/dp/B009ZNBJBM/?tag=kadavyinc-20),
    which allows me to keep my arms at my sides. I went with the model
    that has the 20″ cord, because then I can put it on either side of
    my laptop.
-   [AViiQ Portable Quick
    Stand](//www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00666YYFY/?tag=kadavyinc-20),
    which lifts the screen of my laptop up a few inches, so I don’t have
    to crane my neck down so much.
-   The trackpad on my MacBook Air is still perfectly positioned. I can
    access it with a much more natural wrist and arm position than I
    could the keyboard.

It’s still not ergonomically perfect. Even if I could get my screen as
high as eye-level, then my trackpad would be too high. The AViiQ helps
find a happy medium as far as that is concerned.

![split-keyboard-in-backpack](http://kadavy.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/split-keyboard-in-backpack-225x300.jpg)

The Kinesys Freestyle 2 & AViiQ stand fit in even the smallest
backpacks.

Best of all, this entire setup is totally portable. The AViiQ collapses,
and since the Freestyle 2 is made of two pieces, it folds up and
everything fits even into my tiny [Tumi Empire Zepplin
backpack](//www.amazon.com/T-Tech-Empire-Zeppelin-Small-Backpack/dp/B0043YJLWC/?tag=kadavyinc-20)
(this is discontinued, but it would probably all fit in a
[Marley](//www.amazon.com/Tumi-T-Tech-Marley-Brief-Denim/dp/B00CYBIBZE/?tag=kadavyinc-20)
as well).

### The versatility of the “truly split” keyboard is also great for office setups

For companies who have to do bulk-buying of keyboards that fit a wide
variety of needs, the Freestyle 2 is also great because it can be set up
any way you like it. You can keep the two sides of the keyboard as close
or as far apart as you want, and each hand can be angled as desired.

[![wrist rests for split
keyboard](http://kadavy.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/freestyle-vip_648x339-300x156.jpg)](//www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Freestyle2-VIP3-Accessory-keyboard/dp/B008BVNQW4/?tag=kadavyinc-20)

The VIP 3 adds wrist rests, & allows the keyboards to be angled.

If you want to take things a step further, you can even get some of the
accessories, such as [the VIP
3](//www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Freestyle2-VIP3-Accessory-keyboard/dp/B008BVNQW4/?tag=kadavyinc-20),
which adds wrist rests, and angles the keyboards a bit.

Arguably one of the best features for using the Freestyle 2 at your desk
is that you can have yourself a snack while you work:

### The drawbacks of the Freestyle 2

I did a lot of looking around to make sure the Freestyle 2 was the right
“truly split” keyboard, and it turned out, it was really the *only*
viable option. So, there are drawbacks that I have to live with.

-   **It’s (sort of) expensive.** Some of you may have sticker shock at
    a $115 keyboard, but if you are a technology worker who earns his
    bread through his keyboard, you think this keyboard would suit you
    well, and you think that price is a deal breaker – stop being a
    dumbass. That’s fractions of a penny per billable hour for your
    comfort and longevity. But, if you don’t need a 20″ separation, you
    can always [save a few bucks with the 8″ separation
    model](//www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Freestyle2-Keyboard-Layout-KB800HMBUS/dp/B00ADNBXE6/?tag=kadavyinc-20).
-   **It’s not an Apple keyboard.** By most objective measures, this
    keyboard sucks. It looks like it’s from 1995, it’s bulky, and it
    takes some really solid keystrokes to register. If a soft feel to
    your fingers is more important than the rest of your body, this
    keyboard isn’t for you.
-   **There is a learning curve (and you have to type “right”).** Most
    people ask me how I can manage to type on this keyboard, and there
    was definitely a learning curve. I swear, I could feel my brain
    being rewired as I figured it out. Fortunately, I already typed the
    “right” way, so it just took a couple of days to ramp back up,
    however, I still hit the wrong key now and then, as the option keys
    are in slightly different places than my Air keyboard.

There are some compromises to be made with this keyboard, but I am a
convert to “truly split” forever. **I will be your first Kickstarter
backer** if you’re a hardware person who can design a slim, lightweight,
bluetooth “truly split” keyboard,

### Will this keyboard fix everything?

As great as this keyboard is, ergonomics are only one piece of the
healthy computing puzzle. Even if you get this keyboard, you can’t
expect to pound away at it for 12 hours a day for the rest of your life.
Dr. Peper cautions that paying attention to personal stress, and the
“silent” tension inside of your body can go a long way in keeping
yourself productive and healthy.

> The most important part is that you need to move as often as possible.
> Once we begin working we are stuck in place. This leads to chronic low
> level of unaware muscle tension. People should be taking breaks. That
> is the cheapest intervention.

Dr. Peper recommends the [Stretch Break](//www.paratec.com/) program to
remind you to keep your body moving. I personally have been using
[AntiRSI](//tech.inhelsinki.nl/antirsi/) for years, but Stretch Break
provides more guidance.

    For the price, I might as well just buy an Apple wireless keyboard

        I have actually tried this at work with spare Apple keyboards
        lying around. My back felt so much better, but the most
        frustrating thing about 2 apple keyboards is that the command
        and shift key don’t carry over from one keyboard to the other.
        (Ex: Left hand shift won’t shift your right hand’s hjkl)

        I eventually had to give up the 2nd keyboard for a new employee,
        but it was really nice while it lasted.

    I used to own one of these, as well as an upright mouse because the
    pain in my hands and wrist were so great I couldn’t type or mouse
    around normally. Then a friend introduced me to the book Healing
    Back Pain by Dr. John Sarno (the principles apply to all sorts of
    pain, not just back). Within weeks of reading that book I was able
    to switch to a regular keyboard and mouse. Haven’t looked back. Sold
    my kinesis keyboard and upright mouse on eBay.

    I took the plunge with a Kinesis keyboard about a year ago. It was
    one of the best things I could have done for my forearms/wrists. I
    have the Kinesis Advantage. It seemed like the weirdest one on their
    site, which is why I ended up buying it.

    Before this keyboard, I was having pains in my arms. Now there’s
    virtually no more pain. I really do feel a difference if I use my
    laptop’s keyboard for more than 30 minutes. I also picked up a
    couple Evoluent vertical mice. I believe these devices saved me from
    chronic pain.

    Note that stretching should be done regardless of the peripherals!

    My biggest problem with split keyboards is that almost without fail,
    they put the “6″ key on the wrong side, which screws up all of us
    who learned to touch type properly. Why do they do that?

    It’s especially weird that the Kinesis Freestyle gets this wrong,
    because the Kinesis Advantage gets it right! Unfortunately, that one
    is five times bigger than the laptop, and half as expensive, and
    mounted in a single frame so you can’t place it around your laptop
    like you do.

-   Ken Neville

    Regardless of keyboard choice, your typing position still puts your
    hands and wrists at a distance too far from your body. A keyboard
    tray that extends to place a standard (Apple) keyboard more-or-less
    “in your lap” will probably do far more to ease the strain on your
    arms and shoulders.

-   Loren Pechtel

    I saw an even better version back at Comdex. The keyboard was split
    and the two halves were attached to the chair arms. You put your
    arms on the chair arms and your hands were in the right position to
    type–just ignore where your hands are and use your normal reflexes
    and it works.

    Unfortunately, it was very pricey (you had to buy the whole chair)
    and the keyboard itself was horrible. The touch was way too heavy
    and it was mushy, with no click.

    If there’s some programmer’s god out there, please, a chair arm
    keyboard based on the Northgate keyboards!

-   Dan LaMotte

    I would be curious to know how much different this is from a
    standard ergonomic keyboard. I use a Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard
    and couldn’t be happier. Is there much gain in having the
    separation?

-   Joe Lillig

    I picked up one of these at goodwill. It’s a decent keyboard. I’ve
    also used the dual keyboard setup too. They both work equally well.
