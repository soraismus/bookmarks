Many data science projects and presentations are needlessly derailed by
not having set shared business relevant quantitative expectations early
on (for some advice see [Setting expectations in data science
projects](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2012/04/setting-expectations-in-data-science-projects/)).
One of the most common issues is the common layman expectation of
“perfect prediction” from classification projects. It is important to
set expectations correctly so your partners know what you are actually
working towards and do not consider late choices of criteria
disappointments or “venue shopping.”

Let’s work with a simple but very common example. You are asked to build
a classification engine for a rare event: say default in credit card
accounts. In good times for well managed accounts it is easy to imagine
the default rate per year could be well under 1%. In this situation you
do not want to propose predicting which accounts will actually default
in a given year. This may be what the client asks for, but it isn’t
reasonable to presume this is always achievable. You need to talk the
client out of a business process that requires perfect prediction and
work with them to design a business process that works well with
reasonable forecasting.

Why is such prediction hard? Usually prediction in these situations is
hard because while you usually have access to a lot broad summary data
for each account (net-worth, age, family size, number of years account
has been active, patterns of borrowing, amount of health insurance,
amount of life insurance, patterns of re-payment and so on) you usually
do not have access to many of the factors that trigger the default or
even when you do such variables are not available very long before the
event to be predicted. Trigger events for default can include sudden
illness, physical accident, falling victim to a crime and other acute
set-backs. The point is: two families without health insurance may have
an equally elevated probability of credit default, but until you know
which family gets sick you don’t know which one is much more likely to
default.

Why does everybody ask for prediction? First: good prediction would
fantastic, if they could get it. Second: most layman have no familiar
notion of classifier quality other than accuracy (and measures similar
to accuracy). And if all you know is accuracy then all you are prepared
to discuss is prediction. So the client is really unlikely to ask to
optimize a metric they are unfamiliar with. The measures that help get
you out of this rut are [statistical
deviance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviance_(statistics)) and
[information theoretic
entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)); so
you will want to start hinting at these measures early on.

How do we show the value of achievable forecasting? For this discussion
we define forecasting credit default as the calculation of good
conditional probability estimate of credit default. To evaluate
forecasts we need measures beyond accuracy and measurers that directly
evaluate scores (without having to set a threshold to convert scores
into predictions).

Back to our example. Suppose that in our population we expect 1% of the
accounts to default. And we build a good forecast or scoring procedure
that for 2% of the population returns a score of 0.3 and for the
remaining 98% of the population returns a score near 0.01. Further
suppose our scoring algorithm is well calibrated and excellent: the 2%
of the population that it returns a score of 0.3 and above on actually
tends to default at a rate of 30%.

Such a forecast identifies a 2% subset of the population that has a 30%
chance of defaulting. Treated as a classifier it never says “yes”
because it has not identified any examples that are estimated to have at
least a 50% chance of defaulting (obviously we can force it to say “yes”
by monkeying with scoring thresholds). So the classifier is not a silver
bullet predictor. But it may (when backed with the right business
process) be a fantastic forecaster: the subset it identifies is only 2%
of the overall population yet has 60% of the expected defaults!
Designing procedures to protect the lender from these accounts
(insurance, cancellation, intervention, tighter limits, tighter payment
schedule or even assistance) represents a potential opportunity to
manage half of the lender’s losses at minimal cost. To benefit the
client must both be able to sort or score accounts and have a business
process that is not forced to treat all accounts as identical.

As we have said: laymen tend to only be familiar with accuracy. And
accuracy is not a good measure of forecasts (see: [“I don’t think that
means what you think it means;” Statistics to English Translation, Part
1: Accuracy
Measures](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2009/11/i-dont-think-that-means-what-you-think-it-means-statistics-to-english-translation-part-1-accuracy-measures/)).
What you need to do is shop through metrics before starting your project
and find one that is good for your client. Finding a metric that is good
for your client involves helping them specify how classifier information
will be used (i.e. you have to help them design a business process).
Some types of scores to try with your client include:
[lift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(data_mining)),
[precision/recall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall),
[sensitivity/specificity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity),
[AUC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_curve),
[deviance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviance_(statistics)),
[KL-divergence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback–Leibler_divergence)
and log-[likelihood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function).

Time spent researching and discussing these metrics with your client is
more valuable to the client than endless tweaking and tuning of a
machine learning algorithm.

For a more on designing projects around good data science project
metrics please see [Zumel, Mount, “Practical Data Science with R”
Chapter 5 Choosing and Evaluating
Models](http://affiliate.manning.com/idevaffiliate.php?id=1273_360)
which discusses many of the above metrics.

    Wow. Another great post! A seductive aspect of these projects is
    that the analyst can always tweak a parameter to get different
    results. The point is, there is no statement of significance such as
    with classical hypothesis testing. In classical hypothesis testing,
    the researcher might pick a significance level of 0.05. If a result
    comes back at p-value of 0.06, they’re not supposed to say “That’s
    really close to being significant.” The result either is or isn’t
    significant. They picked the 0.05 level before starting and are
    bound by the rigour of good research practice to not change it. The
    analog being do not adjust parameters for a model until you get the
    confusion matrix you want.

    Question: For projects such as the one you describe, do you think
    we’ll get to a point where there is a rigour? For example, the
    analyst and business agree up front on a threshold for a test, stick
    to it, and if the tests don’t confirm a useful model, they stop and
    move on? “Move one” means working on business processes.

    I’d hate to brakes on discovery. Another seductive aspect of these
    projects is that the next mode or way of looking at the problem or
    data could be the breakthrough that truly adds business value.

    [@Phillip Burger](#comment-17898)\
     Thanks Phillip. All of this is probably more relevant to the
    “Drowning in Insignificance” article. But there are ideas to improve
    procedures (one of the other commenters gave a great reference). One
    thing you can do is insist on a clean run on new data after all the
    tweaks are done and see if things look like a good result or you are
    just seeing a reversion to mediocrity.
