The **actor model** in [computer
science](/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") is a mathematical
model of [concurrent
computation](/wiki/Concurrent_computation "Concurrent computation") that
treats "actors" as the universal primitives of concurrent digital
computation: in response to a message that it receives, an actor can
make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and
determine how to respond to the next message received. The actor model
originated in 1973.^[[1]](#cite_note-1)^ It has been used both as a
framework for a [theoretical
understanding](/wiki/Actor_model_theory "Actor model theory") of
[computation](/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science) "Concurrency (computer science)"),
and as the theoretical basis for several [practical
implementations](/wiki/Actor_model_implementation "Actor model implementation")
of [concurrent systems](/wiki/Concurrent_systems "Concurrent systems").
The relationship of the model to other work is discussed in
[Indeterminacy in concurrent
computation](/wiki/Indeterminacy_in_concurrent_computation "Indeterminacy in concurrent computation")
and [Actor model and process
calculi](/wiki/Actor_model_and_process_calculi "Actor model and process calculi").

History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main article: [History of the Actor
model](/wiki/History_of_the_Actor_model "History of the Actor model")

According to [Carl Hewitt](/wiki/Carl_Hewitt "Carl Hewitt"), unlike
previous models of computation, the Actor model was inspired by physics
including general relativity and quantum mechanics. It was also
influenced by the programming languages
[Lisp](/wiki/Lisp_programming_language "Lisp programming language"),
[Simula](/wiki/Simula "Simula") and early versions of
[Smalltalk](/wiki/Smalltalk "Smalltalk"), as well as [capability-based
systems](/wiki/Capability_(computers) "Capability (computers)") and
[packet switching](/wiki/Packet_switching "Packet switching"). Its
development was "motivated by the prospect of highly parallel computing
machines consisting of dozens, hundreds or even thousands of independent
microprocessors, each with its own local memory and communications
processor, communicating via a high-performance communications
network."^[[2]](#cite_note-clinger1981-2)^ Since that time, the advent
of massive concurrency through
[multi-core](/wiki/Multi-core_(computing) "Multi-core (computing)")
computer architectures has revived interest in the Actor model.

Following Hewitt, Bishop, and Steiger's 1973 publication, [Irene
Greif](/wiki/Irene_Greif "Irene Greif") developed an [operational
semantics](/wiki/Operational_semantics "Operational semantics") for the
Actors model as part of her doctoral
research.^[[3]](#cite_note-greif1975-3)^ Two years later, [Henry
Baker](/wiki/Henry_Baker_(computer_scientist) "Henry Baker (computer scientist)")
and Hewitt published a set of axiomatic laws for Actor
systems.^[[4]](#cite_note-baker1977-4)^ Other major milestones include
[William
Clinger's](/wiki/William_Clinger_(computer_scientist) "William Clinger (computer scientist)")
1981 dissertation introducing a [denotational
semantics](/wiki/Denotational_semantics_of_the_Actor_model "Denotational semantics of the Actor model")
based on power domains^[[2]](#cite_note-clinger1981-2)^ and [Gul
Agha](/wiki/Gul_Agha_(computer_scientist) "Gul Agha (computer scientist)")'s
1985 dissertation which further developed a transition-based semantic
model complementary to Clinger's.^[[5]](#cite_note-agha1986-5)^ This
resulted in the full development of [actor model
theory](/wiki/Actor_model_theory "Actor model theory").

Major software implementation work was done by Russ Atkinson, Giuseppe
Attardi, Henry Baker, Gerry Barber, Peter Bishop, Peter de Jong, Ken
Kahn, Henry Lieberman, Carl Manning, Tom Reinhardt, Richard Steiger and
Dan Theriault in the Message Passing Semantics Group at [Massachusetts
Institute of
Technology](/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology")
(MIT). Research groups led by Chuck Seitz at [California Institute of
Technology](/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology "California Institute of Technology")
(Caltech) and Bill Dally at MIT constructed computer architectures that
further developed the message passing in the model. See [Actor model
implementation](/wiki/Actor_model_implementation "Actor model implementation").

Research on the Actor model has been carried out at [California
Institute of
Technology](/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology "California Institute of Technology"),

Fundamental concepts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Fundamental concepts")]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Actor model adopts the philosophy that *everything is an actor*.
This is similar to the *everything is an object* philosophy used by some
[object-oriented programming
languages](/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming"),
but differs in that object-oriented software is typically executed
sequentially, while the Actor model is inherently concurrent.

An actor is a computational entity that, in response to a message it
receives, can concurrently:

-   send a finite number of messages to other actors;
-   create a finite number of new actors;
-   designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives.

There is no assumed sequence to the above actions and they could be
carried out in parallel.

Decoupling the sender from communications sent was a fundamental advance
of the Actor model enabling [asynchronous
communication](/wiki/Asynchronous_communication "Asynchronous communication")
and control structures as patterns of [passing
messages](/wiki/Message_passing "Message passing").^[[7]](#cite_note-7)^

Recipients of messages are identified by address, sometimes called
"mailing address". Thus an actor can only communicate with actors whose
addresses it has. It can obtain those from a message it receives, or if
the address is for an actor it has itself created.

The Actor model is characterized by inherent concurrency of computation
within and among actors, dynamic creation of actors, inclusion of actor
addresses in messages, and interaction only through direct asynchronous
[message passing](/wiki/Message_passing "Message passing") with no
restriction on message arrival order.

Formal systems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Formal systems")]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the years, several different formal systems have been developed
which permit reasoning about systems in the Actor model. These include:

-   [Operational
    semantics](/wiki/Operational_semantics "Operational semantics")^[[3]](#cite_note-greif1975-3)^^[[8]](#cite_note-agha1993-8)^
-   Laws for Actor systems^[[4]](#cite_note-baker1977-4)^
-   [Denotational
    semantics](/wiki/Denotational_semantics "Denotational semantics")^[[2]](#cite_note-clinger1981-2)^^[[9]](#cite_note-hewitt2006-9)^
-   Transition semantics^[[5]](#cite_note-agha1986-5)^

There are also formalisms that are not fully faithful to the Actor model
in that they do not formalize the guaranteed delivery of messages
including the following (See [Attempts to relate Actor semantics to
algebra and linear
logic](/wiki/Actor_model_later_history#Attempts_to_relate_Actor_semantics_to_algebra_and_linear_logic "Actor model later history")):

-   Several different Actor
    algebras^[[10]](#cite_note-gaspari1997-10)^^[[11]](#cite_note-gaspari1999-11)^^[[12]](#cite_note-agha2004-12)^
-   Linear logic^[[13]](#cite_note-darlington1994-13)^

Applications[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Applications")]

The Actors model can be used as a framework for modelling,
understanding, and reasoning about, a wide range of [concurrent
systems](/wiki/Concurrent_systems "Concurrent systems"). For example:

-   [Electronic mail](/wiki/Electronic_mail "Electronic mail") (e-mail)
    can be modeled as an Actor system. Accounts are modeled as Actors
    and [email addresses](/wiki/E-mail_address "E-mail address") as
    Actor addresses.
-   [Web Services](/wiki/Web_Services "Web Services") can be modeled
    with [SOAP](/wiki/SOAP "SOAP") endpoints modeled as Actor addresses.
-   Objects with
    [locks](/wiki/Lock_(computer_science) "Lock (computer science)")
    (*e.g.* as in
    [Java](/wiki/Java_(programming_language) "Java (programming language)")
    and
    [C\#](/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) "C Sharp (programming language)"))
    can be modeled as a **Serializer**, provided that their
    implementations are such that messages can continually arrive
    (perhaps by being stored in an internal queue). A serializer is an
    important kind of Actor defined by the property that it is
    continually available to the arrival of new messages; every message
    sent to a serializer is guaranteed to arrive.
-   Testing and Test Control Notation ([TTCN](/wiki/TTCN "TTCN")), both
    TTCN-2 and [TTCN-3](/wiki/TTCN-3 "TTCN-3"), follows Actor model
    rather closely. In TTCN, Actor is a test component: either parallel
    test component (PTC) or main test component (MTC). Test components
    can send and receive messages to and from remote partners (peer test
    components or test system interface), the latter being identified by
    its address. Each test component has a behaviour tree bound to it;
    test components run in parallel and can be dynamically created by
    parent test components. Built-in language constructs allow the
    definition of actions to be taken when an expected message is
    received from the internal message queue, like sending a message to
    another peer entity or creating new test components.

Message-passing semantics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Message-passing semantics")]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Actor model is about the semantics of message passing.

### Unbounded nondeterminism controversy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Unbounded nondeterminism controversy")]

Arguably, the first concurrent programs were [interrupt
handlers](/wiki/Interrupt_handler "Interrupt handler"). During the
course of its normal operation a computer needed to be able to receive
information from outside (characters from a keyboard, packets from a
network, *etc*). So when the information arrived the execution of the
computer was "interrupted" and special code called an interrupt handler
was called to *put* the information in a
[buffer](/wiki/Buffer_(computer_science) "Buffer (computer science)")
where it could be subsequently retrieved.

In the early 1960s, interrupts began to be used to simulate the
concurrent execution of several programs on a single
processor.^[[14]](#cite_note-14)^ Having concurrency with [shared
memory](/wiki/Shared_memory "Shared memory") gave rise to the problem of
[concurrency control](/wiki/Concurrency_control "Concurrency control").
Originally, this problem was conceived as being one of [mutual
exclusion](/wiki/Mutual_exclusion "Mutual exclusion") on a single
computer. [Edsger Dijkstra](/wiki/Edsger_Dijkstra "Edsger Dijkstra")
developed
[semaphores](/wiki/Semaphore_(programming) "Semaphore (programming)")
and later, between 1971 and 1973,^[[15]](#cite_note-15)^ [Tony
Hoare](/wiki/Tony_Hoare "Tony Hoare")^[[16]](#cite_note-16)^ and [Per
Brinch
Hansen](/wiki/Per_Brinch_Hansen "Per Brinch Hansen")^[[17]](#cite_note-17)^
developed
[monitors](/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization) "Monitor (synchronization)")
to solve the mutual exclusion problem. However, neither of these
solutions provided a programming-language construct that encapsulated
access to shared resources. This encapsulation was later accomplished by
the [serializer
construct](/w/index.php?title=Serializer_construct&action=edit&redlink=1 "Serializer construct (page does not exist)")
([Hewitt and Atkinson 1977, 1979] and [Atkinson 1980]).

The first models of computation (*e.g.* [Turing
machines](/wiki/Turing_machines "Turing machines"), Post productions,
the [lambda calculus](/wiki/Lambda_calculus "Lambda calculus"), *etc.*)
were based on mathematics and made use of a global state to represent a
computational *step* (later generalized in [McCarthy and Hayes 1969] and
[Dijkstra 1976] see [Event orderings versus global
state](/wiki/Actor_model_early_history#Event_orderings_versus_global_state "Actor model early history")).
Each computational step was from one global state of the computation to
the next global state. The global state approach was continued in
[automata theory](/wiki/Automata_theory "Automata theory") for [finite
state](/wiki/Finite_state_machine "Finite state machine") machines and
[push down stack](/wiki/Stack_machine "Stack machine") machines,
including their
[nondeterministic](/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton "Nondeterministic finite automaton")
versions. Such nondeterministic automata have the property of [bounded
nondeterminism](/wiki/Unbounded_nondeterminism "Unbounded nondeterminism");
that is, if a machine always halts when started in its initial state,
then there is a bound on the number of states in which it halts.

[Edsger Dijkstra](/wiki/Edsger_Dijkstra "Edsger Dijkstra") further
developed the nondeterministic global state approach. Dijkstra's model
gave rise to a controversy concerning *unbounded nondeterminism.*
[Unbounded
nondeterminism](/wiki/Unbounded_nondeterminism "Unbounded nondeterminism")
(also called *unbounded indeterminacy*), is a property of
[concurrency](/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science) "Concurrency (computer science)")
by which the amount of delay in servicing a request can become unbounded
as a result of arbitration of contention for shared resources *while
still guaranteeing that the request will eventually be serviced*. Hewitt
argued that the Actor model should provide the guarantee of service. In
Dijkstra's model, although there could be an unbounded amount of time
between the execution of sequential instructions on a computer, a
(parallel) program that started out in a well defined state could
terminate in only a bounded number of states [Dijkstra 1976].
Consequently, his model could not provide the guarantee of service.
Dijkstra argued that it was impossible to implement unbounded
nondeterminism.

Hewitt argued otherwise: there is no bound that can be placed on how
long it takes a computational circuit called an
*[arbiter](/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics) "Arbiter (electronics)")* to
settle (see [metastability in
electronics](/wiki/Metastability_in_electronics "Metastability in electronics")).^[[18]](#cite_note-zenil-18)^
Arbiters are used in computers to deal with the circumstance that
computer clocks operate asynchronously with input from outside, *e.g.*
keyboard input, disk access, network input, *etc.* So it could take an
unbounded time for a message sent to a computer to be received and in
the meantime the computer could traverse an unbounded number of states.

The Actor Model features unbounded nondeterminism which was captured in
a mathematical model by [Will
Clinger](/wiki/Will_Clinger "Will Clinger") using [domain
theory](/wiki/Domain_theory "Domain theory").^[[2]](#cite_note-clinger1981-2)^
There is no global state in the Actor
model.^[*[dubious](/wiki/Wikipedia:Disputed_statement "Wikipedia:Disputed statement")\\ –\\ [discuss](/wiki/Talk:Actor_model#Dubious "Talk:Actor model")*]^

### Direct communication and asynchrony[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Direct communication and asynchrony")]

Messages in the Actor model are not necessarily buffered. This was a
sharp break with previous approaches to models of concurrent
computation. The lack of buffering caused a great deal of
misunderstanding at the time of the development of the Actor model and
is still a controversial issue. Some researchers argued that the
messages are buffered in the "ether" or the "environment". Also,
messages in the Actor model are simply sent (like
[packets](/wiki/Packet_(information_technology) "Packet (information technology)")
in [IP](/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol")); there is no
requirement for a synchronous handshake with the recipient.

### Actor creation plus addresses in messages means variable topology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Actor creation plus addresses in messages means variable topology")]

A natural development of the Actor model was to allow addresses in
messages. Influenced by [packet switched
networks](/wiki/Packet_switching "Packet switching") [1961 and 1964],
Hewitt proposed the development of a new model of concurrent computation
in which communications would not have any required fields at all: they
could be empty. Of course, if the sender of a communication desired a
recipient to have access to addresses which the recipient did not
already have, the address would have to be sent in the communication.

A computation might need to send a message to a recipient from which it
would later receive a response. The way to do this is to send a
communication which has the message along with the address of another
actor called the *resumption* (sometimes also called
[continuation](/wiki/Continuation "Continuation") or [stack
frame](/wiki/Stack_frame "Stack frame")) along with the message. The
recipient could then cause a response message to be sent to the
resumption.

Actor creation plus the inclusion of the addresses of actors in messages
means that Actors have a potentially variable topology in their
relationship to one another much as the objects in Simula also had a
variable topology in their relationship to one another.

### Inherently concurrent[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Inherently concurrent")]

As opposed to the previous approach based on composing sequential
processes, the Actor model was developed as an inherently concurrent
model. In the Actor model sequentiality was a special case that derived
from concurrent computation as explained in [Actor model
theory](/wiki/Actor_model_theory "Actor model theory").

### No requirement on order of message arrival[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: No requirement on order of message arrival")]

[![image](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg)

This section **needs additional citations for
[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")**.
Please help [improve this
article](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit)
by [adding citations to reliable

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(March 2012)*

Hewitt argued against adding the requirement that messages must arrive
in the order in which they are sent to the Actor. If output message
ordering is desired, then it can be modeled by a queue Actor that
provides this functionality. Such a queue Actor would queue the messages
that arrived so that they could be retrieved in
[FIFO](/wiki/FIFO "FIFO") order. So if an Actor `X` sent a message `M1`
to an Actor `Y`, and later `X` sent another message `M2` to `Y`, there
is no requirement that `M1` arrives at `Y` before `M2`.

In this respect the Actor model mirrors [packet
switching](/wiki/Packet_switching "Packet switching") systems which do
not guarantee that packets must be received in the order sent. Not
providing the order of delivery guarantee allows packet switching to
buffer packets, use multiple paths to send packets, resend damaged
packets, and to provide other optimizations.

For example, Actors are allowed to pipeline the processing of messages.
What this means is that in the course of processing a message `M1`, an
Actor can designate the behavior to be used to process the next message,
and then in fact begin processing another message `M2` before it has
finished processing `M1`. Just because an Actor is allowed to pipeline
the processing of messages does not mean that it *must* pipeline the
processing. Whether a message is pipelined is an engineering tradeoff.
How would an external observer know whether the processing of a message
by an Actor has been pipelined? There is no ambiguity in the definition
of an Actor created by the possibility of pipelining. Of course, it is
possible to perform the pipeline optimization incorrectly in some
implementations, in which case unexpected behavior may occur.

### Locality[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Locality")]

Another important characteristic of the Actor model is locality.

Locality means that in processing a message an Actor can send messages
only to addresses that it receives in the message, addresses that it
already had before it received the message and addresses for Actors that
it creates while processing the message. (But see [Synthesizing
Addresses of
Actors](/wiki/Actor_model#Synthesizing_addresses_of_actors "Actor model").)

Also locality means that there is no simultaneous change in multiple
locations. In this way it differs from some other models of concurrency,
*e.g.*, the [Petri net](/wiki/Petri_net "Petri net") model in which
tokens are simultaneously removed from multiple locations and placed in
other locations.

### Composing Actor Systems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Composing Actor Systems")]

The idea of composing Actor systems into larger ones is an important
aspect of
[modularity](/wiki/Modularity_(programming) "Modularity (programming)")
that was developed in Gul Agha's doctoral
dissertation,^[[5]](#cite_note-agha1986-5)^ developed later by Gul Agha,
Ian Mason, Scott Smith, and [Carolyn
Talcott](/wiki/Carolyn_Talcott "Carolyn Talcott").^[[8]](#cite_note-agha1993-8)^

### Behaviors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Behaviors")]

A key innovation was the introduction of *behavior* specified as a
mathematical function to express what an Actor does when it processes a
message including specifying a new behavior to process the next message
that arrives. Behaviors provided a mechanism to mathematically model the
sharing in concurrency.

Behaviors also freed the Actor model from implementation details,
*e.g.*, the Smalltalk-72 token stream interpreter. However, it is
critical to understand that the efficient implementation of systems
described by the Actor model require *extensive* optimization. See
[Actor model
implementation](/wiki/Actor_model_implementation "Actor model implementation")
for details.

### Modeling other concurrency systems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Modeling other concurrency systems")]

Other concurrency systems (*e.g.* [process
calculi](/wiki/Process_calculi "Process calculi")) can be modeled in the
Actor model using a [two-phase commit
protocol](/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol "Two-phase commit protocol").^[[19]](#cite_note-19)^

### Computational Representation Theorem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Computational Representation Theorem")]

There is a *Computational Representation Theorem* in the Actor model for
systems which are closed in the sense that they do not receive
communications from outside. The mathematical denotation denoted by a
closed system `S` is constructed from an initial behavior `⊥S` and a
behavior-approximating function `progressionS`. These obtain
increasingly better approximations and construct a denotation (meaning)
for `S` as follows [Hewitt 2008; Clinger 1981]:

`DenoteS ≡  progressionSi(⊥S)`

In this way, `S` can be mathematically characterized in terms of all its
possible behaviors (including those involving unbounded nondeterminism).
Although `DenoteS` is not an implementation of `S`, it can be used to
prove a generalization of the Church-Turing-Rosser-Kleene thesis [Kleene
1943]:

A consequence of the above theorem is that a finite Actor can
nondeterministically respond with an
uncountable^[*[clarify](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")*]^
number of different outputs.

One of the key motivations for the development of the actor model was to
understand and deal with the control structure issues that arose in
development of the [Planner programming
language](/wiki/Planner_programming_language "Planner programming language").^[*[citation\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^
Once the actor model was initially defined, an important challenge was
to understand the power of the model relative to [Robert
Kowalski](/wiki/Robert_Kowalski "Robert Kowalski")'s thesis that
"computation can be subsumed by deduction". Kowalski's thesis turned out
to be false for the concurrent computation in the actor model (see
[Indeterminacy in concurrent
computation](/wiki/Indeterminacy_in_concurrent_computation "Indeterminacy in concurrent computation")).
This result reversed previous expectations because Kowalski's thesis is
true for sequential computation and even some kinds of parallel
computation, such as the lambda calculus.

Nevertheless attempts were made to extend [logic
programming](/wiki/Logic_programming "Logic programming") to concurrent
computation. However, Hewitt and Agha [1991] claimed that the resulting
systems were not deductive in the following sense: computational steps
of the concurrent logic programming systems do not follow deductively
from previous steps (see [Indeterminacy in concurrent
computation](/wiki/Indeterminacy_in_concurrent_computation "Indeterminacy in concurrent computation")).
Recently, logic programming has been integrated into the actor model in
a way that maintains logical semantics.^[[18]](#cite_note-zenil-18)^

### Migration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Migration")]

Migration in the Actor model is the ability of Actors to change
locations. *E.g.*, in his dissertation, Aki Yonezawa modeled a post
office that customer Actors could enter, change locations within while
operating, and exit. An Actor that can migrate can be modeled by having
a location Actor that changes when the Actor migrates. However the
faithfulness of this modeling is controversial and the subject of
research.^[*[citation\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^

### Security[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Security")]

The security of Actors can be protected in the following ways:

-   [hardwiring](/wiki/Hardwired_control "Hardwired control") in which
    Actors are physically connected
-   [computer hardware](/wiki/Computer_hardware "Computer hardware") as
    in [Burroughs B5000](/wiki/Burroughs_B5000 "Burroughs B5000"), [Lisp
    machine](/wiki/Lisp_machine "Lisp machine"), *etc.*
-   [virtual machines](/wiki/Virtual_machines "Virtual machines") as in
    [Java virtual
    machine](/wiki/Java_virtual_machine "Java virtual machine"), [Common
    Language
    Runtime](/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime "Common Language Runtime"),
    *etc.*
-   [operating systems](/wiki/Operating_systems "Operating systems") as
    in [capability-based
    systems](/wiki/Capability_(computers) "Capability (computers)")
-   [signing](/wiki/Digital_signature "Digital signature") and/or
    [encryption](/wiki/Encryption "Encryption") of Actors and their
    addresses

### Synthesizing addresses of actors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Synthesizing addresses of actors")]

A delicate point in the Actor model is the ability to synthesize the
address of an Actor. In some cases security can be used to prevent the
synthesis of addresses (see
[Security](/wiki/Actor_model#Security "Actor model")). However, if an
Actor address is simply a bit string then clearly it can be synthesized
although it may be difficult or even infeasible to guess the address of
an Actor if the bit strings are long enough. [SOAP](/wiki/SOAP "SOAP")
uses a [URL](/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator "Uniform Resource Locator")
for the address of an endpoint where an Actor can be reached. Since a
[URL](/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator "Uniform Resource Locator") is a
character string, it can clearly be synthesized although encryption can
make it virtually impossible to guess.

Synthesizing the addresses of Actors is usually modeled using mapping.
The idea is to use an Actor system to perform the mapping to the actual
Actor addresses. For example, on a computer the memory structure of the
computer can be modeled as an Actor system that does the mapping. In the
case of [SOAP](/wiki/SOAP "SOAP") addresses, it's modeling the
[DNS](/wiki/Domain_Name_System "Domain Name System") and rest of the
[URL](/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator "Uniform Resource Locator")
mapping.

### Contrast with other models of message-passing concurrency[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Contrast with other models of message-passing concurrency")]

[Robin Milner](/wiki/Robin_Milner "Robin Milner")'s initial published
work on concurrency^[[20]](#cite_note-20)^ was also notable in that it
was not based on composing sequential processes. His work differed from
the Actor model because it was based on a fixed number of processes of
fixed topology communicating numbers and strings using synchronous
communication. The original [Communicating Sequential
Processes](/wiki/Communicating_Sequential_Processes "Communicating Sequential Processes")
model^[[21]](#cite_note-21)^ published by [Tony
Hoare](/wiki/Tony_Hoare "Tony Hoare") differed from the Actor model
because it was based on the parallel composition of a fixed number of
sequential processes connected in a fixed topology, and communicating
using synchronous message-passing based on process names (see [Actor
model and process calculi
history](/wiki/Actor_model_and_process_calculi_history#Early_work "Actor model and process calculi history")).
Later versions of CSP abandoned communication based on process names in
favor of anonymous communication via channels, an approach also used in
Milner's work on the [Calculus of Communicating
Systems](/wiki/Calculus_of_Communicating_Systems "Calculus of Communicating Systems")
and the [π-calculus](/wiki/Pi-calculus "Pi-calculus").

These early models by Milner and Hoare both had the property of bounded
nondeterminism. Modern, theoretical
[CSP](/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes "Communicating sequential processes")
([Hoare 1985] and [Roscoe 2005]) explicitly provides unbounded
nondeterminism.

[Petri nets](/wiki/Petri_nets "Petri nets") and their extensions (e.g.
coloured Petri nets) are like actors in that they are based on
asynchronous message passing and unbounded nondeterminism, while they
are like early CSP in that they define fixed topologies of elementary
processing steps (transitions) and message repositories (places).

Influence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Influence")]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Actor Model has been influential on both theory development and
practical software development.

### Theory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Theory")]

The Actor Model has influenced the development of the
[Pi-calculus](/wiki/Pi-calculus "Pi-calculus") and subsequent [Process
calculi](/wiki/Process_calculi "Process calculi"). In his Turing
lecture, Robin Milner wrote:^[[22]](#cite_note-22)^

*Now, the pure lambda-calculus is built with just two kinds of thing:
terms and variables. Can we achieve the same economy for a process
calculus? Carl Hewitt, with his Actors model, responded to this
challenge long ago; he declared that a value, an operator on values, and
a process should all be the same kind of thing: an Actor.*

*This goal impressed me, because it implies the homogeneity and
completeness of expression ... But it was long before I could see how to
attain the goal in terms of an algebraic calculus...*

*So, in the spirit of Hewitt, our first step is to demand that all
things denoted by terms or accessed by names--values, registers,
operators, processes, objects--are all of the same kind of thing; they
should all be processes.*

### Practice[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Practice")]

The Actor Model has had extensive influence on commercial practice. For
example Twitter has used actors for scalability.^[[23]](#cite_note-23)^
Also, Microsoft has used the Actor Model in the development of its
Asynchronous Agents Library.^[[24]](#cite_note-24)^ There are numerous
other Actor libraries listed in the Actor Libraries and Frameworks
section below.

Current issues[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Actor_model&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Current issues")]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to Hewitt [2006], the Actor model faces issues in computer and
communications architecture, [concurrent programming
languages](/wiki/Concurrent_programming_language "Concurrent programming language"),
and [Web Services](/wiki/Web_Services "Web Services") including the
following:

-   [scalability](/wiki/Scalability "Scalability"): the challenge of
    scaling up concurrency both locally and nonlocally.
-   [transparency](/wiki/Location_transparency "Location transparency"):
    bridging the chasm between local and nonlocal concurrency.
    Transparency is currently a controversial issue. Some
    researchers^[*[who?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words "Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words")*]^
    have advocated a strict separation between local concurrency using
    concurrent programming languages (e.g.
    [Java](/wiki/Java_(programming_language) "Java (programming language)")
    and
    [C\#](/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) "C Sharp (programming language)"))
    from nonlocal concurrency using [SOAP](/wiki/SOAP "SOAP") for [Web
    services](/wiki/Web_services "Web services"). Strict separation
    produces a lack of transparency that causes problems when it is
    desirable/necessary to change between local and nonlocal access to
    Web Services (see [distributed
    computing](/wiki/Distributed_computing "Distributed computing")).
-   [inconsistency](/wiki/Inconsistency "Inconsistency"): Inconsistency
    is the norm because all very large knowledge systems about human
    information system interactions are inconsistent. This inconsistency
    extends to the documentation and specifications of very large
    systems (e.g. Microsoft Windows software, etc.), which are
    internally inconsistent.

Many of the ideas introduced in the Actor model are now also finding
application in [multi-agent
systems](/wiki/Multi-agent_systems "Multi-agent systems") for these same
reasons [Hewitt 2006b 2007b]. The key difference is that agent systems
(in most definitions) impose extra constraints upon the Actors,
typically requiring that they make use of commitments and goals.

The Actor model is also being applied to client [cloud
computing](/wiki/Cloud_computing "Cloud computing").^[[25]](#cite_note-25)^
