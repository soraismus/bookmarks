Are you being fairly compensated? Google Ventures' Daniel Burka dives
into the data.

Written By [Daniel Burka](/user/daniel-burka)

A few weeks ago I had coffee with an experienced product designer. Let’s
call him Carl. He’d been working at a respected San Francisco startup
for five years, but he was getting restless. Carl had excellent
experience and skills. Heck, the guy was even a decent coder.

I fired off a few emails to several startups that were right up Carl’s
alley. One was an almost perfect match--it offered the right design
challenges and aligned with Carl’s personal interests. He interviewed
with the company the next day and the team was thrilled. In less than 24
hours the CEO sent Carl an offer to be their lead designer.\
 A so-called 'Senior UX Designer' at an SF-based agency is quite
possibly a 24-year-old recent graduate earning $60,000 a year.

Unfortunately, the company significantly low-balled him on compensation.
Carl was not impressed. He personally felt undervalued, and he worried
that the company’s culture might underrate design generally. How did
this crucial misstep occur?

For startups, coming up with a fair offer can be difficult. Publicly
available data from popular job sites is murky at best. Even when salary
charts appear credible, they’re riddled with hidden problems. Be
careful, most of the data you will find skews very low.

At Google Ventures, we help our portfolio companies find, interview, and
hire senior design talent--more than 40 top-level designers in the last
two years alone. We know about what works and are always keen to learn
more.

I spent a few days analyzing publicly available salary information to
clarify the picture for our portfolio companies and other startups like
them. This is what I found.

![image](//f.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2014/09/3035968-inline-i-1-how-top-startups-pay-designers.jpg)

#### The problem

When I searched online for salary data, the first results were
[Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm),
[AngelList](https://angel.co/salaries), and
[SimplyHired](http://www.simplyhired.com/). Each site lets you enter
some variation of geographic region and job title to display a graph of
typical salary ranges. It’s pretty easy to get a range of salaries for
“UX Designer in San Francisco,” for instance. So, what’s the problem?\

-   -   **The “designer” label is really broad.**Many salary sites lump
    a huge range of designers together. Graphic designers generally get
    paid much less than UX designers or digital product designers--the
    designers typically hired by top startups.
-   **Agency salaries weigh down the curve.** These data include design
    salaries from across the business spectrum. Glassdoor, for instance,
    includes quite a few design agencies. Many agencies make money by
    undercompensating and over-hyping young designers. A so-called
    “Senior UX Designer” at an SF-based agency is quite possibly a
    24-year-old recent graduate earning a $60,000 salary.
-   **Not all startups are created equal.** Even on AngelList, where
    there are few agency jobs, you’ll find plenty of startups that
    aren’t paying designers competitively. (Maybe they are scrappy and
    bootstrapped, or maybe they just don’t value design.) Looking at
    these startups as a whole is like including both the major leagues
    and farm teams in a survey of ballplayer salaries. If you’re trying
    to hire the best talent available, don’t be led astray by salaries
    offered by less competitive teams.
-   **Equity and other compensation are poorly represented.**Oftentimes,
    startups balance lower salaries with higher equity or other perks
    (see below). Salary graphs have a very difficult time representing
    this balance appropriately. SimplyHired, for instance, lumps big and
    small companies together--a publicly traded company is represented
    the same as a startup offering equity.

The bottom line? If you rely on broadly available summary data, you’re
not comparing apples to apples.

#### The simple way to get informed

With just a little bit of work, it’s possible to glean useful data from
AngelList and Glassdoor. Here’s what I did:

1.  Isolated for geography: San Francisco
2.  Isolated for job title: UX Designer, UI Designer, and Visual
    Designer
3.  Chose a few dozen companies that are in the same league as many of
    the small-to-medium-sized businesses in our portfolio. I filtered
    out design agencies, less well-funded startups, and big companies
    like Facebook, Salesforce, or Adobe.
4.  Copied each company’s salary range into a spreadsheet.
5.  For comparison, did the same for typical full-stack engineering
    jobs.
6.  This gave me fairly homogenous data that matched anecdotal evidence
    we’ve heard in the industry.

#### What I discovered for San Francisco, circa 2014

When I compared compensation details among like-sized startups in San
Francisco, a few trends became clear.

#### There is a hierarchy of design skills

Even among designers of similar seniority, there is marked difference in
compensation for UX Design, UI Design, and Visual Design. Typical
salaries for each in SF:

-   **Senior UX Designer:** $100,000 to $150,000
-   **Senior UI Designer:**$90,000 to $140,000
-   **Senior Visual Designer:**$85,000 to $130,000

(Note: “Senior designer” is generally loosely defined as someone with
five to seven years as a practicing professional designer.)

#### Top startups pay similar salaries to the big companies

Surprisingly, design salaries at big, well-known companies in San
Francisco are similar to those offered at startups. Big companies often
include cash-like additions such as 401k matching, bonuses, or stock;
but startups can offer equity that may become much more valuable.
Compensation parity between startups and big companies reflects the
super-competitive environment for design talent in San Francisco.Design
salaries at big, well-known companies in San Francisco are similar to
those offered at startups.

#### Designers are paid similarly to engineers (or a bit less)

Another useful rubric is that in 2014, many San Francisco startups are
paying their Senior UX Designers about 10% less than their senior
engineers. About half the startups I checked were actually paying their
designers and engineers the same amount.

I may be biased, but a smart entrepreneur would put design and
engineering salaries on par and be sure to explain this to prospective
designers. It shows that the company values design as much as
engineering.

Obviously, all of this is specific to San Francisco. I suspect some of
these trends are typical of large U.S. cities, but you should do your
own local research.

    Thanks, awesome work Daniel. You've explained with very clear
    reasons why the design salaries across industries are not easy to
    compare at a glance. I wonder of there's something like this for
    London. I find the same thing here, companies value design, speak
    highly of it but when it comes compensation they tell you "ahh, but
    this agency pays lead UX only x amount" that's what we had in mind
    too.

    Fast Company's description of design usually includes
    industrial/product desingers, graphic/communication designers,
    interior designers, architects, information designers, and more. To

    Daniel,

    This is good information, but I agree with RitaSue above, especially
    about industrial designers.

    I'm interviewing with a well-funded start-up next week. I have 30+
    years experience (going back to OSF/Motif), and can code in "hard"
    and scripting languages. In addition, I can manipulate audio and
    video. I've worked in large enterprise and small / start-ups.

    This start-up wants everything in this role -- basically it's what
    used to called an "evangelist" -- coding, requirements gathering
    from clients to be communicated to the engineering team, creating
    marketing collateral (to include audio / video and "social media",
    writing white papers. And more... :-)

    It's going to be an interesting interview, and I hope they don't try
    to low-ball me -- 'cuz then I'll have to have to expend a tremendous
    effort not to fall out of my chair laughing.

    You're both right. The article I wrote was originally written for
    our Google Ventures portfolio companies. There are certainly a broad
    swath of designers at those companies, but they trend towards
    digital product design roles. The same methodology will apply to ID,
    marketing design, and other aspects of the overall design landscape.
    But you'd have to do a bit of your own legwork. It also doesn't
    specifically addresss figures outside SF.

    This wasn't meant as a conclusive report but rather as a useful
    guide to finding credible numbers.

    Good luck and share what you find about your profession in your
    region.

#### From the Editor

Thanks for stopping by Fast Company’s Co.Design. Our focus is on
highlighting the world’s best examples of design and innovation, working
in concert. We started this site with a few simple premises in mind.
First, design is a window onto the world at large, and the culture we
live in. Designers create objects that meet some unrecognized need. All
businesses strive to do the same thing.
