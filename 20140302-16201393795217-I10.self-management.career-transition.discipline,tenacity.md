Love](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_ku-xlarge/180px4uh6cmk6jpg.jpg)S

*The following is an excerpt from Cal Newport's [So Good They Can't
Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You
Love](http://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124?&tag=lifehackeramzn-20&ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|5947649[asin|1455509124[authorId|5753529629858233150).*

### The Passion Hypothesis

To simplify things, I'll use the "passion hypothesis" to refer to the
popular belief that the way to end up loving your career is to first
figure out what you're passionate about, and then pursue it (a strategy
often summarized with the pithy phrase, "follow your passion.") The more
I studied this hypothesis, the more I noticed its danger. This idea
convinces people that there's a magic "right" job waiting for them, and
that if they find it, they'll immediately recognize that this is the
work *they were meant to do*. The problem, of course, is when they fail
to find this certainty, bad things follow, such as chronic job-hopping
and crippling self-doubt.

But without the passion hypothesis to guide us, what should we do
instead? How do people *really* end up loving what they do? To answer
this question we need to turn our attention to an unexpected career
adviser.

### Becoming a Craftsman

In a 2007 episode of the *Charlie Rose* show, Rose was interviewing the
actor and comedian Steve Martin about his memoir [*Born Standing
Up*](http://www.amazon.com/Born-Standing-Up-Comics-Life/dp/1416553649?&tag=lifehackeramzn-20&ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|5947649[asin|1416553649[authorId|5753529629858233150).
They talked about the realities of Martin's rise. In the last five
minutes of the interview, Rose asks Martin his advice for aspiring
performers.

"Nobody ever takes note of [my advice], because it's not the answer they
wanted to hear," Martin said. "What they want to hear is ‘Here's how you
get an agent, here's how you write a script,' . . . but I always say,
**‘Be so good they can't ignore you.' "**

In response to Rose's trademark ambiguous grunt, Martin defended his
advice: "If somebody's thinking, ‘How can I be really good?' people are
going to come to you."

This is exactly the philosophy that catapulted Martin into stardom. He
was only twenty years old when he decided to innovate his act into
something too good to be ignored. "Comedy at the time was all setup and
punch line . . . the clichéd nightclub comedian, rat-a-tat-tat," Martin
explained to Rose. He thought it could be something more sophisticated.
It took Martin, by his own estimation, ten years for his new act to
cohere, but when it did, he became a monster success. It's clear in his
telling that there was no real shortcut to his eventual fame, and the
compelling life it generated. "[Eventually] you are so experienced
[that] there's a confidence that comes out," Martin explained. "I think
it's something the audience smells."

If you're not focusing on becoming so good they can't ignore you, you're
going to be left behind. This clarity is refreshing. It tells you to
stop worrying about what your job offers you, and instead worry about
what you're offering the world. This mindset–which I call the craftsman
mindset-allows you to sidestep the anxious questions generated by the
passion hypothesis—"Who am I?", "What do I truly love?"—and instead put
your head down and focus on becoming valuable.

Martin's advice, however, offers more than just a strategy for avoiding
job uncertainty. The more I studied it, the more convinced I became that
it's a powerful tactic for building a working life that you eventually
grow to love. As I'll explain below, regardless of how you feel about
your job right now, adopting the craftsman mindset can be the foundation
on which you build a compelling career.

### Career Capital Theory

Research shows that the traits that lead people to love their work are
general, and can be found in many different career paths. They include
things like autonomy, a sense of impact and mastery, creativity, and
respect and recognition for your abilities. Once you recognize that
these traits have little to do with following a pre-existing passion,
and can be cultivated in many different fields, you can safely abandon
the myth that there's a single *right* job waiting out there for you.

Of course, this still leaves open the question of how you gain these
factors in your working life. One of the first things I noticed when I
began to study this question is that these traits are rare. Most jobs,
for example, don't offer their employees great autonomy and the ability
to make a big impact. If you're a recent college graduate in an
entry-level job, you're much more likely to hear "go change the water
cooler" than you are "go change the world."

By definition, we also know that these traits are *valuable*—as they're
the key to making a job great. But now we're moving into well-trod
territory. Basic economic theory tells us that if you want something
that's both rare and valuable, you need something rare and valuable to
offer in return—this is Supply and Demand 101.

When you hear the stories of people who ended up loving what they do,
this same pattern comes up again and again. They start by painstakingly
developing rare and valuable skills—which we can call *career capital*.
They then leverage this capital to gain rare and valuable traits in
their career. These traits lead to a feeling of passion about their
working life. If career capital is the key to developing passion, then
this explains the importance of Steve Martin's craftsman mindset. By
focusing on becoming so good they can't ignore you, you're maximizing
the rate at which you acquire the capital you need to take control of
your livelihood.

### Passion 2.0

"Follow your passion" is an appealing idea because it's simple and
immediate. If you can figure out what you're *meant* to do, it promises,
a deep love for your career is just around the corner. The reality I'm
proposing is less glamorous. It argues that passion takes time and hard
work—harder work than most people naturally invest in their jobs. It's
also less certain in the sense that you cannot predict in advance the
details of the compelling career you're cultivating. But it compensates
with clarity.

Stop worrying about what the world owes you, it says, and instead, put
your head down, like Steve Martin developing his act, and strive to
become so good you can't be ignored. It's this straightforward goal—not
some fairy tale about dropping everything to pursue a dream job—that
will lead you toward a working life you love.
