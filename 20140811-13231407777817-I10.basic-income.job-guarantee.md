By [Pavlina Tcherneva](http://neweconomicperspectives.org/about.html)

Slate’s Matt Yglesias is out with another caricature of
[post](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/01/16/jobs_guarantee_more_trouble_than_it_s_worth.html)
on the Job Guarantee (JG) and, guess what? He still doesn’t like what he
sees. He’s all for guaranteeing *income* to people who can’t find jobs,
but he’s opposed to making receipt of that money “conditional on
performing make-work labor for the government.” As one of the leading
proponents of the JG, let me say this for the n^th^ time: THE JOB
GUARANTEE IS NOT ‘MAKE-WORK.’ This is not a reaction to Yglesias but
*a*core principle of the earliest literature on the Job Guarantee (e.g.,
[here](http://cas.umkc.edu/econ/economics/faculty/Forstater/papers/BookChaptersEnclopediaEntries/Full%20employment%20and%20social%20justice.pdf),
[here](http://www.amazon.com/Workfare-Fair-Work-Government-Programs/dp/0813522331)
and [here](http://www.philipharvey.info/benchmarking.pdf)). There is no
way that anyone familiar with even a sliver of the [vast
collection](http://neweconomicperspectives.org/mmt-scholarship) of
books, articles, essays, working papers, policy briefs and blog posts on
the JG could, in good faith,
[continue](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/01/16/jobs_guarantee_more_trouble_than_it_s_worth.html)
to claim that the JG is “make-work.”

After straw manning the JG, Yglesias expresses his enthusiasm for a
Basic Income Guarantee (BIG). He prefers simply handing out money to the
jobless because it’s not as “messy” as the JG. (I’ve already
[argued](http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2014/01/dazed-confused-matt-yglesias-job-guarantee.html)
why such objections should not be taken seriously). But more
importantly, like many BIG advocates, he assumes that the BIG will
magically solve the fundamental problem of economic insecurity.

Here are sixteen reasons why this assumption is wrong.

MACRO ISSUES

\1. Yglesias may not realize it, but all serious academic support for
BIG is based on the idea that many people will quit working (this is
considered desirable in order to eliminate bad jobs and ultimately
‘decommodify’ labor; e.g.
[here](http://psc.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/16/0191453711413715.abstract)
and [here](http://www.basicincome.org/bien/pdf/CaputoFullPaper.pdf) ).
So the goal is to reduce the supply of labor and reduce production.

\2. JG provides a “good job” alternative to people who work in “bad
jobs”. When private employers want them back, they have to**provide at
least the same or better living wage-benefit package and work conditions
offered in the JG. JG sets the labor standard.

\3. Under BIG, production drops, consumption rises, and so do prices.
Suddenly, the value of the BIG grant has been eroded. Great success: the
poor are still poor.

\4. Under JG, employment rises, socially useful production rises, and
(as we have argued many times) some of that production is dedicated to
the benefit of the poor, providing goods and services at the local level
that the private sector has not provided, and thus it absorbs part of
the wage. In other words, both supply and demand rise.

\5. Coupled with its countercyclical mechanism, JG is an inflation
stabilizer (not an inflation generator, like BIG). We’ve modeled this
many times (see
[here](http://www.epicoalition.org/docs/buffer_stock_employment_model_in.htm),
[here](http://t.co/mzZ4hKEdGm),
[here](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2003051)).
Inflation from other sources is, of course, possible (runaway bank
lending, speculation, oil shocks etc.—all are separate issues.)

\6. BIG is not countercyclical. It’s universal, unconditional, but does
not fluctuate with the business cycle. JG is a direct response to
recessions and expansions.

\7. There is no mechanism by which BIG can ensure full employment over
the short or long run. Only the JG can.

\8. In short, BIG doesn’t deal with price (or
[currency](http://www.moslereconomics.com/mandatory-readings/full-employment-and-price-stability/))
stability, useful output, or any of the negative externalities from
unemployment.

POVERTY

\9. As Amartya Sen taught us, poverty is not just a function of lack of
adequate income. Providing income alone does not eliminate poverty.

\10. The poor and the unemployed *want to
work*([here](http://pavlina-tcherneva.net/TchernevaBIGvsJG.pdf),
[here](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_516.pdf%5F))*.* And as my
work on Argentina
[showed](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/01/the-job-guarantee-video/)
(9m14s), receiving income is the **fifth** reason why the poor wanted to
work!**Why do BIG advocates presume to know what’s better for the poor
than the poor themselves? BIG does little for those who want to work.

\11. There is almost a ‘neoclassical market equilibrating assumption’
behind most BIG analysis that says: “as long as people have cash, the
market will magically provide the goods for them, allow them to acquire
assets, provide them with the freedom to do what they please, etc. etc.”
If the market hasn’t solved these problems now, why would it do so just
because people get cash? All structures that marginalize, reduce
opportunities, and discriminate remain. JG is not a panacea for all
these problems, but it deals with one crucial and *systemic* aspect of
marginalization – the absence of guaranteed *decent* work.

\12. Amartya Sen also taught us that what matters is not just freedom,
but *substantive* freedom. That is, policy has to 1) recognize what
individuals themselves want and value; 2) it must provide these
opportunities; and 3) it must remove obstacles from taking advantage of
these opportunities.

\13. The JG does precisely that: recognizes many people want paid work,
provides the job opportunity, and removes obstacles from taking the
opportunity by targeting the jobs to the communities, and providing the
very services that one might need in order to take care of these
opportunities (education, transportation, care etc., etc.).

\14. BIG may lull the recipients into a false sense of security. Once
the BIG grant proves inadequate to liberate the poor from their poverty,
and the poor decide to search for better paying jobs and opportunities,
they will not be there. Just like they aren’t now. As research has shown
the mark of unemployment is devastating and unemployment breeds
unemployability.

\15. Again, many BIG bloggers are not familiar with even the basic BIG
literature. There is such a thing called ‘participation income’ and
‘civic minimum’ in serious scholarly work (Atkison 1995 and White 2003,
respectively)—an idea that society is built on the principle of
reciprocation. Society provides you with a basic income; you reciprocate
by participating in socially-productive activities. This is exactly what
the JG does. No matter what Yglesias says, it is not based on the
coercion principle of workfare, but rather on the principle of
participation.

\16. I find it ironic that we have to debate each other. BIG and JG
stand on much the same principles. Let policy provide an opportunity to
all to perform socially useful activities on the ‘participation
principle’ through the JG, while supporting those who cannot (the young,
retired, disabled, with onerous care burden) and we have a stronger,
more stable economy that creates socially useful activities that serve
the public purpose.

Yes, sending a check to people is not as “messy,” but let’s stop
pretending that it*’*s a panacea for the fundamental problem of economic
insecurity.

    Under the historical regime, BIG would lead to inflation due to
    increased consumption without increased production. However, I
    believe that there is good reason to believe this is barely the case
    today, and irrelevant in the near future.

    We are at the dawning of an Artificial Intelligence fueled
    production revolution. But let us peer into the near future some 10
    years from now where cars drive themselves, AI manages business
    operations at local and corporate levels. Manual labor is replaced
    by cheaper machines that can navigate a business or factory, provide
    assistance, tirelessly work 24 hours per day. In this world, human
    labor is almost always less efficient and more costly than AI
    powered labor.\
     In an AI powered world the limit to production is not human labor,
    but natural resources and political agendas. BIG is necessary in
    that world, and JG might prove to be a trap because no business is
    hiring at any wage.

        Perhaps this AI powered world exists in the minds of some
        science fiction writers, but in the real world in which I live
        there is an enormous amount of labor that is currently hands on
        human and will remain so for many decades if not forever. A
        newly invented machine may take over some of this work, but who
        will invent that machine? Will it simply self-invent?

            Yes for now.\
             However, you will see the first major change with coming of
            AI powered shipping and delivery made possible with
            self-driving cars and trucks. Whole industries are hard to
            replace, and those will be the first.

            And it is not sci-fi fantasy. It is happening.

        Porn. The Web’s killer app. (Yeah, that was a smutty comment,
        but it is economic activity. I read somewhere that there are
        something like 5000 webcams for it in Britain alone.) When some
        activities reach levels of productivity that have little need
        for labour, other activities see opportunities to expand to
        satisfy the wants that aren’t being easily met.

    Yglesias:

    “Now obviously none of this is to dispute the uncontroversial view
    that at any given time a certain number of people should be working
    for the government (teachers, cops, bus drivers, etc.) or that
    short-term surges of public sector employment (in, for example,
    construction) should be on the table as a counter-cyclical measure.”

    Thank you for the throrough series of articles about the jobs
    guarantee. I wonder if you could point me to the specific Amartya
    Sen litereature you reference. Also, there is a recurring MMT claim
    that needs much more elucidation; that poverty and unemployment are
    created by fiscal policy… or… what. I would like to understand the
    cause of poverty and unemplyment. I’m no economist but I’ve been
    consuming NEP blog articles to the best of my ability for over a
    year now. It’s the most interesting writing being done in our
    nation, period. Thanks again.

        If the government of a brand new nation start taxing everybody
        100 squidos but hasn’t issued any squidos everybody turns around
        and says “I will work for a wage paid in squidos” -EVERYBODY is
        unemployed because the govt tries to run a surplus. Monetary
        policy cannot fix it – you can lower rates all you want, the
        problem remains. Now if the govt issues 100 per head by spending
        still some people will capture a surplus and save it, so there
        will still be some unfortunate enough to look for work to earn
        more squidos. The government has to issue enough to cover the
        tax bill + the savings desire of the private sector. Then you
        get full employment. Issue more and you get inflation.

        Watch Mosler and Kelton on this:

        Youtube “mosler soft currency” and “modern money public purpose
        2″

        I’ll take a shot.

        Imagine a closed economy with no government, but money. There
        are factories and workers. If the workers spend all their
        income, they can buy all the output.

        But if the workers save some of their income, then some of the
        output will go unsold. The factory owners will cut back
        production, and some workers will be unemployed, until
        production is reduced to the level of spending, and the market
        clears.

        Now add a government and a foreign sector. They might buy some
        of the output, restoring full employment. Or the foreign sector
        might sell more products than they buy, effectively becoming
        another saver of the currency, resulting in more unemployment.
        Government might run a balanced budget, being neutral, or a
        surplus, also acting as a saver and causing unemployment. Or it
        might run a deficit, and consume the otherwise unsold output,
        and eliminate the unemployment.

        As sponsor of the monetary system, and issuer of the currency,
        the government is morally obligated to make sure that there is
        enough demand to consume all the output the economy can produce,
        so that there is no unemployment. If they fail to do so, then
        the unemployment is their fault. Unemployment is the evidence
        that the government deficit is too small. Said another way, that
        taxes are too high for the size government we have.

        One of my favorite MMT meme’s comes from either Wray or Billy
        Mitchell.\
         The government is responsible for unemployment, so it should
        fix the problem it has created.\
         I always thought that summed it up nicely, after I figured out
        what it meant of course.

    Participation matters.

    One of the fundamentals of human psychology is that humans will only
    share their resources with those that they perceive as ‘pulling on
    the same rope’. It’s one of the things that makes us special as a
    species and it is wired in at a very low level. (Three year olds
    exhibit the behaviour).

    And that means that what I think about what you’re doing matters. If
    I don’t like it, and enough of me don’t like it then **we will
    politically agitate to stop it**.

    Income guarantee can have no longevity, in the same way that
    unemployment benefit has no longevity. We can’t even get universal
    Child Benefit to stick here in the UK (rich people “don’t need it”
    apparently. Next stop on the attack list the universal state
    pension).

    And that’s because people resent those they see as slacking off.

    Whether you like it or not, you have to be seen to be doing
    something that enough of your peers consider ‘useful’. And what that
    is depends upon the social maturity of the society you live in. Work
    cannot be anything you want, because your peers will not permit it.

    There is a reason that recent polls support providing jobs for all,
    but not income for all. It’s entirely human to do so.

    I find it amazing that progressive individuals cannot stand the idea
    that ‘individual freedom’ has limits in a society. Three year olds
    can work that out, so I don’t understand where this burning desire
    to revert to toddler behaviour comes from.

        This. What Neil said. Yes. This is IMHO the biggest obstacle to
        BIG. Even when we overcome the inflationary bias of BIG, we
        still need to deal with reciprocity as one of the most important
        forces of social cohesion. Yglesias and academics can promote
        BIG all they want, and even if they convinced a significant
        number of people that it worked, even if it *could* work, the
        “productive” members of society will still resent the “slackers”
        and will vote accordingly. We have a hard enough time as it is
        convincing the “productive” that poor on welfare aren’t all
        slackers who “deserve” their station. BIG has the same problem
        magnified.

        The cynical part of me wonders if this is *why* the beltway
        elite (Yglesias as exemplar) are proposing BIG \> JG. Because
        they know it is not remotely politically viable but it serves to
        take the wind out of the sails of the JG.

            It is a quintessentially a Progressive idea that such things
            as food, shelter, health care are human rights, and as such
            those of us who have the means also have an obligation to
            provide them to those without the means. And to provide them
            as a right, not as compensation for anything they do. That
            is BIG, not JG. Only if the Progressive is trained in
            economics would they prefer JG. I think your cynicism is
            misplaced.

            “The poor will be with you always” is a 2000-year-old quote.
            JC couldn’t change that, and JG won’t do it either. In
            recognition of that, many in society have long had
            compassion for those who are unable to help themselves. Only
            since that function was subsumed by government has there
            been resentment about that help, and even now that
            resentment is grounded in the lack of understanding of
            monetary sovereignty and the nature of fiat currency.

                You’re assuming that monetary compensation accurately
                reflects the worth of the things we do.\
                 Hazel Henderson, among others, has argued that the
                “love economy” consisting of spouses, child/parent
                caretakers, volunteers, and many other examples of
                unpaid work which would nevertheless cost a lot to
                replace, is actually much larger than the paid economy.
                A B.I.G. would just be one way of recognizing this
                under-appreciated contribution.\
                 There is not, and never was, such a thing as a free
                market. In reality, we have always had some degree of
                crony capitalism, wherein those at the top economically,
                game the rules even more so they garner…even more money.
                This shows up in the de facto regressive tax system that
                has the middle class paying a higher percentage in taxes
                than the elite, in subsidies from undertaxed land to
                wage subsidies for the working poor that end up
                subsidizing big rich corporations who don’t pay a living
                wage, etc.

                    It’s true, it would cost a lot to outsource all the
                    things we do in house, even for a single person
                    taking care of nobody but himself. It’s a tradeoff.
                    If I can make $100 an hour by doing something for
                    someone else, then I can afford to pay outsiders for
                    services I would normally perform for myself, like
                    housekeeping and cooking. OTOH, if my own labor is
                    only worth $10 an hour, it makes no sense for me to
                    pay $15 an hour to free up that time for my own
                    work. When people take care of family members, it is
                    the same tradeoff. When you provide care for your
                    parents or children, you’re saying that you can’t
                    use that same time to make more money than you would
                    have to pay an outsider to do that work. (Some of
                    the reasons for the higher cost of outside help, and
                    the lower cost of doing it yourself, is not the work
                    itself but taxes and regulations that apply only to
                    the outsider.)

                    And there are non-economic considerations, too, what
                    economists call “utility”. Spending time with your
                    kids is a lot more fun than what most people do at
                    work.

                    We live in a monetary economy. The currency is the
                    unit of account. What anything is “worth” in that
                    system, including a person’s time and skills, is the
                    amount that a willing buyer would pay for it.

                        Many of the things we do that are unpaid are not
                        really “fun.” I was the primary caretaker for my
                        father in the last year of his life. It was not
                        always “fun,” though I’m glad I did it. The
                        point is though, that that kind of necessary
                        work would cost a lot more on the open market,
                        probably not be done as well, or at least not as
                        caringly, and that society needs to prioritize
                        this too.\
                         The fact is that those with the money make the
                        rules (The Golden rule: “He who has the most
                        gold…rules”). That doesn’t make these things the
                        most beneficial to society – what, after all, is
                        the benefit to society of John Paulson making
                        billions shorting the housing market, or of the
                        top 25 hedge fund managers in a year, who
                        typically earn more than a billion, each (even
                        though, as a whole, they under-perform the S&P)?
                        There may be value in entrepreneurs, but
                        multi-decade patents? Not so much. Stock returns
                        that are only taxed at 15%? Even less – the
                        internet was born during Clinton’s time, when
                        stock returns were taxed at 20-25%. That didn’t
                        hold anyone back, and never has. In fact, wealth
                        inequity, like we have now, decreases
                        opportunity.

                    You’re right, there are very few examples of
                    perfectly competitive markets, none of which occur
                    on the scale of an entire economy. The very notion
                    of “rules” in the market implies the reduction of
                    freedom, and participants in markets always try to
                    accumulate market power. Only if government enforces
                    rules to prohibit accumulation of market power can
                    markets remain mostly competitive. Corruption is
                    always a threat, and corrupt government officials
                    will never promote free markets.

                 Since income distribution is a bell curve with some
                kind of tail, there will always be a portion of the tail
                that will qualify as poverty no matter where the center
                of the curve falls. Improving the average income, either
                with a JG or BIG will still leave some at the end of the
                tail. The only “solution” would be to fix the poverty
                level at some arbitrary figure and insure everyone is
                above that figure.

                |

                You are right that BIG is quintessentially progressive,
                no cynicism required. “The poor will be with you always”
                was paraphrasing an already 800-600 year old quote
                (Deuteronomy 5:11). In both instances they were meant
                not so much as a prediction, as prelude to an
                exhortation: “You shall freely open your hand to your
                brother, to your needy and poor in your land,” or
                “whenever you wish you can do good to them, but you do
                not always have me.” Which is to say, I agree with you.

                I didn’t mean that reciprocity is the only thing going.
                But BIG is not that different from other forms of
                welfare (other than as new channel for inflation) and
                it’ll be subject to the same political venom from people
                who resent any form of “wealth redistribution” and other
                misinformed rhetoric about the idle “deserving poor”.
                I’m already convinced our current welfare system is less
                generous than it ought to be, but convincing a plurality
                of the population and their voted representatives to
                increase welfare will be rancorous. On the other hand, I
                firmly believe that *some* sort of JG proposal really
                *can* be sold to “the 99%” of both progressives and
                conservatives.

                I think this is simply a rephrasing of Ms Tchenerva’s
                points \#15 and \#16: *There is such a thing called
                ‘participation income’ and ‘civic minimum’… an idea that
                society is built on the principle of reciprocation.
                Society provides you with a basic income; you
                reciprocate by participating in socially-productive
                activities… Let policy provide an opportunity to all to
                perform socially useful activities on the ‘participation
                principle’ through the JG, while supporting those who
                cannot (the young, retired, disabled, with onerous care
                burden).*

            If 1/3 of the economy is “economic rent,” we can easily give
            BIG to everyone without disturbing the peace of “productive
            members” of the society.

                As long as BIG is not greater than the idle capacity, or
                we also tax somebody to reduce their spending until it
                no longer exceeds the productive capacity.

                And if it’s a “guarantee”, why does it have to be paid
                to those who already have more than the basic level of
                income? That’s like asking for your money-back guarantee
                when you’re totally satisfied with the product.

        “One of the fundamentals of human psychology is that humans will
        only share their resources with those that they perceive as
        ‘pulling on the same rope’.”

        And yet we live in a society where slacking off is perfectly
        viable as long as you’ve been born into the right circumstances,
        i.e: through inheritance, while most others are naturally
        burdened by having to pay rent, which accounts for over 50% of
        their living expenses (either that or mobility).\
         Worse still there are plenty of people around pursuing careers
        that seemingly destroy production and get rewarded heavily.\
         Following through with these basic human sentiments I doubt
        that a JG would pass as anything more than a make-work program.
        I think we’d instead all be working out in the fields as ordered
        by our khmer rouge style dictators.\
         Basing economic policy on human principles of “fairness” is not
        such a smart idea.

        “It’s one of the things that makes us special as a species and
        it is wired in at a very low level.”\
         No, afaik this behaviour has been shown atleast in chimps.

        Is really the “academic support for BIG based on the idea that
        many people will quit working” really the serious one? I’ve
        heard arguments in defense of BIG of why it would not lead to a
        reduction of production, and that’s exactly in line with “10.
        The poor and the unemployed want to work”.

        Don’t get me wrong. I don’t think introducing a BIG is anywhere
        viable anywhere in the near future or that the
        “unconditionality” aspect of it may be attainable at all.

            Yes, I agree, sharing scarce resources reciprocally is not
            special to humans, fundamental to much more than human or
            even primate psychology. More or less common to the
            “psychology” of all living things. Focusing on perception,
            rather than reality, is misguided. This is so universal,
            biologically universal because it works. The universe out
            there can be unfriendly. A BIG (lots of money for everyone
            for nothing) is a sham. It won’t work because it can’t work
            – universal parasitism. Of course a restricted BIG, a NIT,
            is another matter, especially if there is a JG.

            *Following through with these basic human sentiments I doubt
            that a JG would pass as anything more than a make-work
            program. I think we’d instead all be working out in the
            fields as ordered by our khmer rouge style dictators.* I
            don’t follow at all. Where are the Khmer Rouge dictators? As
            I have said, focusing on perceptions of unfairness is the
            wrong thing. The JG is right because not having it is
            obscenely unfair, unjust, not because people merely perceive
            not working as unjust.

            A JG is a very simple tried and true idea, essentially
            tested worldwide for decades in the Keynesian full
            employment era, tested during the New Deal as the WPA etc.
            Tested everywhere before that, really – unemployment helps
            nobody, no nation in the long run, so we should decide not
            to have it, and nations which have decided to not have
            unemployment tend to get rich. I would characterize the JG
            as “not running your monetary production economy in an
            insane way.” No Khmer Rouge dictators arose back then or
            were necessary to enforce people working – at jobs they by
            and large were happy to have.

            *Basing economic policy on human principles of “fairness” is
            not such a smart idea.* Maybe, but it is the *only* idea.
            The only way that humans ever have organized economies. Do
            we have much of an alternative to human principles? Seems
            like a better idea than insect colony principles..

                    Not if it’s done right. JG should focus on jobs that
                    are done today by volunteers. They are productive
                    and worthwhile, and often go begging for lack of
                    workers willing to do them for nothing.

                    *Because people do not only perceive freeloading as
                    unjust, but also jobs which are seemingly
                    counterproductive or not productive at all (and the
                    JG would create a lot of jobs in the latter
                    category).* No, it wouldn’t. It wouldn’t create any
                    such jobs. Why? – because the JG presumes the
                    society has gotten its act together, gotten together
                    to decide to to jobs that everyone thinks is a good
                    idea. There are a colossal number of such jobs, an
                    enormous amount of such work to do. Yes, a bad JG
                    would have Khmer Rouge (or Nazi) commandants doing
                    Bad Things, and would be worse than nothing, worse
                    than unemployment. But there is a social consensus
                    that death camps are a bad thing, so they won’t be
                    part of the JG.

                    *the radical left and right each have their very own
                    idea of what these unproductive types work
                    constitute and are determined to eliminate them. the
                    khmer rouge tried to narrow in what type of work
                    really was really of subsistence. I don’t think
                    there is really any objective measurement of what
                    someones contribution to society is, not even if
                    they are unemployed. Even trying to establish a
                    general consensus of what type of contributions to
                    society are desired is difficult. (even piracy under
                    the right circumstances can be seen as a valid and
                    productive enterprise)*

                    That there isn’t “really any objective measurement
                    of what someone’s contribution to society is” is
                    true, but so what? And there may be cases where
                    everybody doesn’t agree, but so what? – there is an
                    enormous area of consensus, which is what is
                    important. Government spending in general and the JG
                    in particular *determines and measures* what
                    someone’s contribution to society is. You can call
                    the fact that the jobs to do are arrived at by
                    democratic decision-making “merely” “subjective” and
                    not a holy “objective”, but so what?

                    A JG with goals outlined by an average 12 year old
                    would be infinitely superior to the disgusting
                    crimes and lunacies and welfare for the rich that
                    the US public money now mainly goes to – and which
                    bear far more resemblance to the Khmer Rouge than a
                    modern WPA / PWA / CETA – a JG would. There is an
                    enormous, society-wide consensus that the things
                    which have been proposed as JG jobs do things which
                    are good in their own right. The arguments against
                    it are always about completely imaginary
                    side-effects, nobody argues that more and cleaner
                    parks, housing the homeless, food banks, better
                    elder care, a better environment, “green New Deals”
                    etc are Bad Things in and of themselves.

                I think mostly free economies are based more on the
                biologic principals of evolution. The successful changes
                survive and flourish and are widely imitated, while
                unsuccessful efforts fail. “Fairness” is the watchword
                of the planned economy.

                    The concept of “fairness” or “justice” is universal
                    and implicit in any human society, in human
                    cognition. In societies where the state has
                    “intervened” to create money and the type of
                    “planned economy” called a “free market”, this is
                    usually expressed in commercial exchanges, exchanges
                    of goods and services and labor for money, whose
                    driving and ultimate source and sink are the
                    money-issuing and destroying activities of the
                    state, which directly express the society’s ideas of
                    “fairness”. True, it is “based on” biological
                    principles of evolution, but so is everything.

                    The idea that modern “capitalism” is more natural,
                    more evolutionary, than modern “socialism”, and that
                    that would make one better or worse than the other
                    is just silly. Both are natural and neither are
                    natural. Basically, they’re Tweedledum and
                    Tweedledee, if Lewis Carroll had made them Siamese
                    twins.

    “BIG is not countercyclical.”

    It is if accompanied by the necessary vast hike in taxation rates
    (UK calculations suggest that the rate would need to be about 50% of
    any additional earnings).

    Which of course does nothing more than increase the resentment from
    those working of those merely BIGging it up.

    There are always attempts to get around this – trying to make the
    tax rate more progressive, etc. But it is all lipstick on a pig.

    If you strip out half of your automatic stabiliser system, then
    something else has to take the strain.

    Mrs. Tcherneva,

    What are your thoughts on establishing both a BIG and a JG which
    would allow each individual a choice? As a self-employed person/life
    long student, I’d prefer a BIG which would allow me to invest the
    transfer on myself at my discretion. This would not only greatly
    reduce my risk of failure leading to financial hardship while also
    providing me the opportunity to train myself in the skills I want to
    master.

    Secondly, students, stay at home parents, etc are all performing
    unpaid work. I’d imagine a BIG would improve their situation where a
    JG would not (if they can’t find the time to both work as
    students/parents and at the guaranteed job).

    Understandably not everyone would prefer this and would want to work
    (\#10 in your list) through the JG program instead. They would have
    the ability to chose the JG route over a BIG.

    Both the BIG and JG make assumptions having to do with human
    behavior. Human behavior isn’t homogeneous though seeing as
    preferences and circumstances vary.

    Clearly, I am bias considering a JG would not be helpful to me as I
    want to make it as a self employed person (unless the JG would 100%
    allow me to continue to do what I’m currently doing, but pay me an
    additional guaranteed income).

        I think JG should support training for a job or a degree – GED,
        at least – but the idea is for people to become productive
        members of society so they can support themselves, not to
        support learning as a career or “self-employment” that generates
        no income. It would be nice if we could all pursue the finer
        things and be supported, but then who would produce the real
        goods and services we need if we were all life-long students?

        Maybe in the year 2525, when AI machines do everything we need,
        we can all have that luxury.

            golfer1john,

            Those that strive to master their craft are always learning
            and therefore are lifetime students. Furthermore receiving
            nominal incomes in a monetary economy like ours is
            incredibly important not only for the well being of
            individuals, but to sustain the incentives to produce and
            innovate. That goes without saying. However on the whole
            (aggregate level), we as a group/society surely don’t strive
            to generate nominal income. What matters is that the system
            works in a way where real living standards rise over time.
            Isn’t the point of having a monetary, financial, legal, and
            political system to facilitate this goal of improving the
            living standards of the members of the society?

            From an individual level, I don’t only work and master my
            skills in order to support myself. I surely could think that
            way and probably work half as hard. However, I see an
            individual’s life as having the potential to vastly improve
            the lives of those around them. Some will go on to change
            the world in fundamental ways. In this light, the idea isn’t
            to develop individuals for the sake of having them only
            support themselves, but to hopefully give them the ability
            to improve the lives of others.

            Thus, for our sake I hope there are enough life-long
            students working diligently on problems that once solved
            will revolutionize the world we live in.

            “Maybe in the year 2525, when AI machines do everything we
            need, we can all have that luxury.”

            Real GDP per capita has surpassed its peak of 2007 and yet
            we have 2 million fewer people employed and the population
            has grown by over 14 million. The employment to population
            ratio sits at 30 year lows.

            A restrain in the real economy’s ability to produce isn’t
            the problem we face today. The problem is that we as a group
            are squandering human potential by having individuals sit
            unemployed when they want to work, have people underemployed
            doing jobs that don’t allow them to fulfill their potential,
            and have people (some paid really well) that must stay in
            their jobs which they understand to be socially
            unproductive.

            Fundamentally, I see the situation today as a being a
            problem of poor social organization due to some bad policies
            (corrupt institutions) and unimaginative minds not a problem
            that results from our inability to produce (especially
            material things). Hopefully some highly educated and
            intelligent individuals are taking the time to study the
            problems we face today. If so, they have the potential of
            doing a lot more than just supporting themselves by
            generating an income.

                It’s hard to disagree with any of those platitudes, but
                if someone does something useful, then usually, even
                today, there is somebody who will pay him for the
                product of his efforts. And in case there is not, if the
                market won’t do it, then it is a “public purpose” that
                government will pay for. There are lots of clever people
                getting paid for doing things not very useful. Getting
                paid is the easy part, if the demand is there.

                And, as you can see at this web site, there is no
                shortage of “highly educated and intelligent individuals
                … taking the time to study the problems we face today”.

                We have no shortage of people willing and able to do
                useful things. The problem today is that government is
                not willing to make up for the leakages of demand in the
                economy, and so a large number of people can find no
                buyers for their talents. JG is that missing buyer. BIG,
                if allowed to increase the deficit, would also provide
                additional demand, but with BIG and no JG there would
                still be leakages and unemployment, with all its
                inherent miseries. The myriad of poverty programs are,
                in effect, a BIG, though probably not at the level
                advocates would desire. I don’t see that simply
                increasing the stipend would “revolutionize the world we
                live in”. And I see no reason to think that the people
                who will come up with the ideas to revolutionize the
                world are now constrained from having those ideas by the
                need to make a living. If that were the case, then why
                have the vast majority, if not all, of the previous
                revolutionary ideas come from people in their working
                lives, and not in their retirement?

                    golfer1john,

                    I agree with your first paragraph. If one views
                    children as human capital then parenting can be seen
                    as the act of developing that capital. Parents,
                    along with the institutions which aid parents
                    (schools etc.), provide a work whose ultimate
                    productive output is unquantifiable or at least very
                    difficult to measure. Yet, many stay at home parents
                    would not directly benefit from a JG, but would a
                    BIG (financed through t-security issuance). A
                    parenting wage is not something that market
                    provides. Mosler speaks to his in one of his videos.

                    On the other hand, there are not only clever people
                    getting paid for doing things that objectively are
                    not very useful, but are potentially destructive.
                    This can occur when the benefits to the individual
                    or the supplier of the income (business/corp) are
                    larger than the social costs. Society as a whole my
                    suffer, but the wage is paid based on the
                    individual’s ability to make their employer better
                    off regardless.

                    “And I see no reason to think that the people who
                    will come up with the ideas to revolutionize the
                    world are now constrained from having those ideas by
                    the need to make a living.”

                    Some people work at jobs solely because they need an
                    income to live even if the job stagnates their
                    development. This is time lost which could have been
                    spent more productively. Time lost is unrecoverable,
                    this is forever lost potential which is unseen and
                    difficult to quantify. All jobs, whether menial or
                    advanced, leads to mental and sometimes physical
                    exertion which constrains the individuals ability to
                    develop ideas as this takes time and energy. In some
                    (hopefully many) cases, individuals are working in
                    jobs which allow them to develop in a way that is
                    consistent with their desires. From the Steve Jobs,
                    to the MMTers who teach economics, to parents, some
                    are fortunate to find themselves being very
                    productive while exerting themselves to accomplish
                    goals which they so desire.

                    Can we really say this is true for everyone
                    especially those working sometimes more than full
                    time in the lowest paying jobs that require few
                    skills? Especially after the recession, some are
                    stuck because they cannot realistically take the
                    risk of leaving work and foregoing an income in
                    order to transition themselves into other fields by
                    developing their skill set. I saw this when working
                    in the hotel business after college as well as when
                    working in the mutual fund industry. In the latter,
                    individuals stayed in jobs which they hated and
                    understood to be unproductive because they were
                    constrained by responsibilities that required them
                    to always draw a high income.

                    “If that were the case, then why have the vast
                    majority, if not all, of the previous revolutionary
                    ideas come from people in their working lives, and
                    not in their retirement?”

                    Working in which jobs? Menial ones? Ones they knew
                    wouldn’t help their development and resulted in a
                    huge time suck or ones which allowed their ideas to
                    flourish? Were some of them really working solely
                    for an income? Were some successful, but took on
                    enormous personal risks? What about those that took
                    risk and failed? Furthermore, what does it mean to
                    be “retired?” As \#10 states on the list, people
                    want to work. I would go further. I think a mentally
                    developed individual wants to not only work, but
                    work in a job which they believe adds value.

                    I bet taking risk, luck, and path dependence among
                    many factors played a crucial role in the creation
                    of revolutionary ideas. A JG and a BIG together can
                    help mitigate the risks of failure (financial
                    instability/destitution) associated with really
                    taking the time to develop potentially revolutionary
                    ideas. A JG+BIG also reduces the role of luck which
                    comes from being at the right place at the right
                    time. This includes birth in that who you are born
                    to and the social conditions both play a hugely
                    important role. A JG and a BIG together can equalize
                    the opportunity by allowing choice. Why should those
                    only born to supportive parents deserve a “BIG?”
                    From personal experience, having very supportive
                    parents was hugely beneficial and a competitive
                    advantage for me when transitioning in my career
                    development.

                        “Some people work at jobs solely because they
                        need an income to live even if the job stagnates
                        their development. This is time lost which could
                        have been spent more productively.”

                        Yes, but if the job is to be done at all, then
                        someone is doing it. Whoever that is might have
                        been doing something more productive. If Bill
                        Gates had not been busy with Windows, he might
                        have invented an OS with some security, which
                        would have been a great benefit to society.
                        Whoever takes care of your kids while you’re
                        pursuing your dreams also might have been doing
                        something more useful to society than what you
                        did instead.

                        We do have a BIG already. It is not in the form
                        of a cash payment to each person, but in the
                        nature of a guarantee, paid only to those who do
                        not already have it, and paid in kind for the
                        most part. It may not be enough, but it is
                        there. Giving Bill Gates another $1000 a month
                        in addition to his millions probably would not
                        have resulted in any better code, or any other
                        more useful accomplishment.

                        If you want to say the BIG should be increased,
                        and be more cash, that’s a whole different
                        point. I would argue that it should always be
                        means-tested, as it is today. There is certainly
                        enough slack in the current economy for a
                        significant increase, if that is the way we
                        choose to address the problem, but doing it in
                        unnecessary and excessive ways today – such as
                        $1000 a month for everyone, $4T a year – would
                        surely cause unacceptable inflation.

                            “Yes, but if the job is to be done at all,
                            then someone is doing it.”

                            Yes. Now the reason is why are they choosing
                            to do it. If they are solely making this
                            choice based on the need for income in order
                            to survive, then this is the freedom to
                            chose, but not really freedom of choice. The
                            individual has limited control over the
                            alternatives when one of the choices exposes
                            them to a high risk of financial
                            instability/poverty (if they chose to forgo
                            an income in order to pursuit self-directed
                            work/development which they deem to be most
                            productive).

                            Some can’t not work as their subsistence is
                            dependent on drawing an income from it. As
                            long as this is the case and they aren’t
                            lucky enough to be born into better
                            situations, then they will be forced to work
                            in jobs that they otherwise would not
                            voluntarily chose to. This is a loss of
                            control over their own life which some are
                            fortunate enough to never have to
                            experience.

                            This makes your example concerning Bill
                            Gates fundamentally different. Mr. Gates,
                            the person able to pursue their dream, and
                            possibly the child caretaker have all been
                            able to chose how they decide to spend their
                            finite and valuable time. In your example,
                            if the child caretaker is doing work solely
                            for income then a basic BIG provides them
                            with an improved choice set. The person who
                            is voluntarily choosing to go for their
                            dreams will have to better compensate the
                            caretaker if they wish for them to take care
                            of their children.

                            This is why I would be supportive of a BIG
                            and JG together. A JG alone does not solve
                            the problem described above having to do
                            with a loss of control over how one spends
                            their time. Again this loss of control isn’t
                            felt by everyone as not all are born into or
                            find themselves in such a circumstance. On
                            the other hand, a BIG may not solve the
                            problem of an economy that isn’t creating
                            enough jobs. As technological advancements
                            continue to increase productivity, humanity
                            may be trending on a path that creates
                            material abundance with fewer individuals
                            employed relative to the size of the
                            population. If this is the case and our
                            productive capacity is improving immensely
                            over time, then deficit financed BIG or JG
                            are more likely to result in increased real
                            output and not price inflation.

                            Some would leverage a BIG in order to create
                            productive work for themselves and others
                            which could very well add a lot of value to
                            society (and in doing so increasing
                            productivity and capacity even more which
                            would reduce inflationary pressures by
                            increasing potential real GDP). However,
                            this isn’t true for everyone. Some my very
                            well desire to go the JG route especially if
                            the jobs offered are of high quality and
                            productive (which they should be, right?).
                            Either way, the option is open to the
                            individual.

                            If some opt out of the workforce in order to
                            live off a BIG, this should tighten the
                            labor market which puts upward pressure on
                            nominal wages. This would cause a widening
                            in the divergence between the set nominal
                            BIG transfers and wages that potential
                            earners can attain. Although a universal BIG
                            wouldn’t go away, its size relative to the
                            prevailing wages offered would not remain
                            stable. Therefore, I think it is logical to
                            assume that as wages rise, those that left
                            the workforce my desire to reenter. They
                            wouldn’t lose the BIG upon reentering, but
                            by not reentering they lose the possibility
                            of earning additional income.

                            Since the future is unknowable, it just
                            isn’t possible to know how large the deficit
                            would need to be in any given year in the
                            future. Thus, it could be advisable to
                            transfer smaller amounts than $1000 a month
                            at least initially. Start with small deficit
                            financed transfers to all individuals and
                            see how the economy responds. The size of
                            the distributions could be tied to real
                            output targets, nominal GDP, and/or
                            inflation. If real output continues with
                            minimal inflation, increase the distributed
                            amounts whether through a JG and/or BIG. A
                            JG is essentially a BIG with a job attached.

                            ” if that is the way we choose to address
                            the problem, but doing it in unnecessary and
                            excessive ways today – such as $1000 a month
                            for everyone, $4T a year – would surely
                            cause unacceptable inflation.”

                            It is hard to determine ex ante what
                            “excessive” fiscal deficits are in today’s
                            incredibly productive global economy. After
                            the financial crisis, it was touted that
                            multi year trillion dollar deficits would
                            surely lead to hyperinflation (which now
                            seems laughable). Yet, the CPI barely ever
                            broke above 3% and sits at an annual change
                            of 1.5%. Given this downward trend in
                            inflation, excessively high unemployment
                            globally, idle resources, and monetary
                            policy that is fighting to keep the policy
                            rate from permanently being pinned to the
                            zero lower bound, if anything the fiscal
                            deficits are much much too small. Given
                            fiscal policy has been tightened in the last
                            few years, the policy stance is trending in
                            the wrong direction. Unfortunately, as time
                            passes this represents a permanent loss of
                            potential productivity and innovation
                            (unless someone has a time machine).

                            “Giving Bill Gates another $1000 a month in
                            addition to his millions probably would not
                            have resulted in any better code, or any
                            other more useful accomplishment.”

                            I think Matt Bruenig of
                            [http://www.demos.org/](http://www.demos.org/)
                            made the point that the universality of BIG
                            even to the very wealth is important because
                            it prevents the programs (including JG) from
                            being framed as redistribution which it
                            isn’t. Everyone has the choice of
                            participating and as long as they are
                            deficit financed via treasury issuance no
                            one is taxed to directly pay for the
                            programs. This is especially true if real
                            GDP increases from here on.

                            The treasury securities which remain in the
                            hands of the private sector and Fed
                            represents a national form of equity.
                            T-securities in the hands of the private
                            sector represent a net asset to them which
                            increases their financial net worth. This
                            clearly wouldn’t be unique to deficit
                            increases attributable to a BIG/JG
                            considering there currently exists trillions
                            of dollars worth of treasuries outstanding
                            which are the residual of past deficits.
                            Realistically, the “debt” never gets paid
                            off but will exist in perpetuity. Yet, past
                            deficits and their present residuals in the
                            form of t-securities have not lead to
                            inflation. On the contrary I’d argue that
                            without those past deficits and the current
                            treasury securities outstanding, the economy
                            would never have been able to produce the
                            way it has.

                            Mr. Gates in receiving a BIG today would
                            probably not all of a sudden change the way
                            he uses his time. This is partially because
                            he was born in the right place at the right
                            time when the internet and economy were
                            taking off and he had the mental capacity
                            and support to leverage this trend. A BIG
                            may have been useful to him then, maybe not.
                            However, it would have helped to make sure
                            that he would never have had to choose
                            between his productive passion or working at
                            a menial job for poor wages just to survive.
                            If he had, we would probably all have been a
                            little worse off. Maybe not! We can’t know
                            what would have happened.

                            Besides, if he gets a BIG, my educated guess
                            is that a huge percentage of it (if not all)
                            will just exist as a bank deposit never to
                            get spent into the real economy\*. Really a
                            modest BIG to someone with a high net worth
                            is probably much much smaller then what
                            would occur relative to if their tax rate
                            had been cut by a percent.

                            \*Making an educated guess on his marginal
                            propensity to consume.

                        “As \#10 states on the list, people want to
                        work.”

                        Well, I don’t want to work any more. There are a
                        few jobs I might take, but I don’t want them
                        enough to try to get them. I want to spend what
                        I saved while I was working. I think most people
                        my age feel the same way. Of course, there are
                        some who will willingly work until they can’t do
                        it anymore, regardless of their finances, and
                        good for them. Many more who are still working
                        would prefer to be retired. A bigger BIG could
                        help get them out of the work force.

                        \#10 says *some* people, the poor and
                        unemployed, want to work. The unemployed, by
                        definition, want to work. \#10 goes on to say

                        “… receiving income is the fifth reason why the
                        poor wanted to work! Why do BIG advocates
                        presume to know what’s better for the poor than
                        the poor themselves? BIG does little for those
                        who want to work.”

                        I would object to the last sentence, I think BIG
                        would do as much as any other spending increase
                        to raise (traditional) employment. The point is
                        that if the BIG recipient is still unemployed,
                        and many would be, without JG, then their main
                        problem is still unsolved.

                        Even with the currently large output gap, the
                        available policy space is still finite. BIG for
                        everyone in a substantial amount would more than
                        consume the available space, leading to tax
                        increases or inflation or both.

    Hi Rafael,

    My JG-type proposals (admittedly still hasn’t been published except
    in my PhD thesis but hopefully the book will be out soon) would
    allow many of the groups you mention to be able to partake in the
    activities you mention. This is because I suggest the JG alongside a
    work-time based earning subsidy regime, but other activities could
    be counted as work.

    Self-employment clearly counts as work, presuming that the company
    meets the required criteria. Similarly, carers and students would
    also be eligible for what I refer to as ‘hour credits’ for their
    activities.

    The strict limits on this might exclude you for all I know, but the
    aim of politics isn’t to provide what you and I (as a fellow eternal
    student/writer) would prefer, but rather what is fairest overall. I
    don’t think the BIG is very fair to people who (mad as I might think
    they are) want to work and consume a lot but don’t have the kind of
    family background and natural which would make this easy for them.

    I can’t say whether this would be the case with all JG proposals but
    these things certainly aren’t mutually exclusive. (You could also
    have a JG and BIG together though this would then be expensive on
    both counts)

    What does this article mean? That BIG ja JG are exclusive? If so,
