Getting started with Clojure in Vim
===================================

February 25, 2014
-----------------

When I started learning Clojure, I was afraid I'd have to learn Emacs.
With its long history of great Lisp support, it's no surprise that Emacs
is the editor used in many of the Clojure screencasts and live coding
demos I've seen. But I'm a Vimmer and, while I love learning new things,
I didn't want to have to learn a new language \_and\_ a new editor at
the same time. I started learning Clojure using[Light
Table](http://www.lighttable.com/), which is fantastic (and even has
decent Vim keybindings), but after mastering the basics of the language,
I surveyed the landscape and returned to Vim armed with a set of plugins
to make working with Clojure in Vim pretty darn great.

If you want to get started working with Clojure in Vim, here's a quick
guide to the popular plugins you'll want to use and the key features you
should know for each.

Language support
----------------

[VimClojureStatic](https://github.com/guns/vim-clojure-static) gives you
the basics of what you'll need when editing Clojure in Vim. From the
README:

-   Syntax highlighting for Clojure and ClojureScript buffers.
-   Configurable Clojure-specific indentation.
-   Basic insert mode completion for special forms and public vars in
    clojure.core.

REPL integration
----------------

[Fireplace.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace), another
fantastic plugin by the amazing tpope, makes it easy to evaluate Clojure
code from a buffer by connecting to a running nREPL server (this is what
you get when you run \`lein repl\`). Quick tips:

-   Start vim from the same directory you ran \`lein repl\` from and it
    will automatically detect the nREPL host/port info, or use
    \`:Connect\` in Vim.
-   \`cpr\` (my mnemonic: *clojure please require*) takes the content
    from the active buffer and requires it inside the REPL.
-   \`cpp\` (my mnemonic: *clojure please print*) evaluates the
    outermost form under the cursor and prints it at the bottom of the
    screen.
-   \`cqp\` (my mnemonic: *clojure quick print*) gives you a one-line
    REPL prompt at the bottom of the screen (for quick one-liner evals).
-   \`[\` jumps to the definition for the symbol under your cursor, even
    if it's inside the Clojure source!
-   \`K\` gives you documentation for symbol under cursor.
-   \`:A\` takes you to the test (if you're in the implementation) or
    vice-versa, and \`:AS\` or \`:AV\` gives it to you in a horizontal
    or vertical split.

There's a [great Fireplace.vim tutorial over on Clojure's
site](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/vim_fireplace.html),
which you should definitely read for more info.

Efficient editing
-----------------

Of course, the Vimmer in you will want to know how to efficiently edit
Clojure code more efficiently. Some common operations include:

-   wrapping text objects in parens (useful for introducing a \`let\`
    expression)
-   moving adjacent elements in/out of a form
-   spliting/joining forms
-   inserting your cursor at the beginning/end of a form

Two popular options make it easy to perform these these sorts of edits:
Paredit.vim and vim-sexp.

Ask any Emacs user how to manage lisp code and they'll probably tell you
about Paredit. [Paredit.vim](https://github.com/vim-scripts/paredit.vim)
is an attempt to port much of Emacs' Paredit features to Vim, and it
does a pretty good job. One distinguishing feature of Paredit.vim (vs
vim-sexp) is that it does a great job of preventing you from having
unbalanced parentheses at any time. It takes a bit of getting used to,
but I think it's a good feature once you get the hang of it.

If you try Paredit.vim and don't like it, another great option is
[vim-sexp](https://github.com/guns/vim-sexp); it gives you a lot of the
same features as Paredit.vim, but it doesn't try as hard to keep your
code in balaced state. But, if you prefer working in a terminal Vim,
you'll want to check out tpope's verbosely named
[vim-sexp-mappings-for-regular-people](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sexp-mappings-for-regular-people),
which just remaps a lot of the functionality to keep you from pressing
the meta key (which doesn't play nice with Terminal vim).

I won't cover the keystroke mappings here, since each plugin does things
differently, but both plugins have great documentation, so check out
their \`:help\` docs for more info.

Other tips
----------

If you've tried LightTable, you probably remember the rainbow colored
parentheses it uses to help you keep track of which form you're in. If
you want that in vim,
[rainbow\_parentheses.vim](https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim)
has you covered. If you give this a try and don't see the colors,
remember that you need to turn it on with \`:RainbowParenthesesToggle\`
or configure vim to enable it automatically (see the README). Also, your
color scheme might be interfering with the colors, so if you're toggling
and still not seeing changes, try a different color scheme (Solarized
doesn't play nice, for example).

Even though Fireplace.vim is great, there are times when you'll still
want to head over to the REPL. And, if you've got the REPL running in
another window or tab, it can be annoying to switch back and forth
to/from Vim. To remove this friction, I strongly recommend running Vim
inside Tmux, with Vim in one pane of a split and a REPL in the other. Of
course, if you try this, you might still be annoyed that switching focus
between Tmux splits doesn't work the same way as moving between splits
in Vim. Don't worry; it doesn't have to be this way. [Vim Tmux
Navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator) lets you
seamlessly move between Vim and Tmux splits. It's well-worth setting up.
