Algebraic Data Types
====================

Posted on [July 30,
2014](http://tech.esper.com/2014/07/30/algebraic-data-types/ "11:58 pm")

Algebraic data types are the fundamental building blocks of programs in
ML-style languages like Haskell and OCaml. Since they play such an
important role in these languages, it is well worth understanding how
they work and where they come from—at first, the design may feel a bit
arbitrary, but in reality it flows naturally from a reasonable starting
point.

Algebraic data types are made up of two components: products (also known
as structs, records or tuples) and variants (also known as tagged
unions, sums or coproducts). Let’s take a look at each of these in turn,
how they can be combined and how they’re related.

Products
--------

**Products** are a construct that appears in most programming languages:
it’s a type that contains multiple values. The simplest example in OCaml
would be a pair (just like an ordered pair in mathematics):

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
# let pair = (1, 2);;
val pair : int * int = (1, 2)
~~~~

This `pair` has the type `int * int` which means it has two members,
both integers. In prose rather than code, this is often written as
`int × int` because it corresponds to a *cross-product* of sets.
Fundamentally, we can do two interesting things with a pair: get the
first element or get the second element:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
# let first (x, y) = x;;
val first : 'a * 'b -> 'a = <fun>
# let second (x, y) = y;;
val second : 'a * 'b -> 'b = <fun>
~~~~

In OCaml, pattern matching makes the definitions pretty visual. The
functions `first` and `second` are often abbreviated as `fst` and `snd`
or `π₁` and `π₂` (`π` is used because these are *projection* functions).

Of course, we want to be able to build up more complicated types than
pairs, so most languages support having *any* number of fields

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
let tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4);;
val tuple : int * int * int * int = (1, 2, 3, 4)
~~~~

and giving fields names

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
# type blarg = { foo : int; bar : int };;
type blarg = { foo : int; bar : int; }
# let x = { foo = 1; bar = 2 };;
val x : blarg = {foo = 1; bar = 2}
~~~~

This is very useful for actual programming, but does not really give us
any new capabilities. Both larger tuples and records are isomorphic to
constructions made up of just pairs; for example, we can go back and
forth between `int * int * int * int` and `int * (int * (int * int))`
(made up of nested pairs):

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
let from (a, b, c, d) = (a, (b, (c, d)));;
let to' (a, (b, (c, d))) = (a, b, c, d);;
~~~~

This is good news: it means that to understand products in their full
generality, we just need to understand pairs. Other constructs like
larger tuples and records come “for free” because we can always build up
an equivalent structure just out of pairs.

You’ll note that records are very similar to features of languages like
C that don’t have tuples at all—records are just like C structs! Even in
Java, a language pretty far removed from OCaml, we have record-like
functionality in the form of fields on objects; a value object is pretty
much the same as an OCaml record:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .Java}
public class Blarg {
  public final int foo, bar
}
~~~~

So products are certainly a pretty universal construct. While these
languages do not have tuples or pairs themselves, we can still *think*
about their products in terms of tuples, which will let us reuse our
theory of product types in a lot of different contexts.

Variants
--------

The other component of algebraic data types are **variants**. Unlike
products, variants only tend to exist directly in functional
languages—most common OO and procedural languages do not support them
directly, although certain common patterns try to emulate them. Happily,
it looks like this is changing with the advent of languages like Rust
and Swift which *do* support them.

Where products contain multiple values, variants can be any of multiple
possibilities. Instead of having *both* field 1 *and* field 2, they have
*either* field 1 *or* field 2. In fact, that’s what we can call our
simple variant building block: `either` (in the spirit of Haskell):

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
type ('a, 'b) either = Left of 'a 
                     | Right of 'b
~~~~

We can construct different values of this type:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
# let left = Left 1;;
val left : (int, 'a) either = Left 1
# let right = Right 1;;
val right : ('a, int) either = Right 1
~~~~

In real programming, we generally write custom variants for our types:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
type AST = Expr of ...
         | Stmt of ...
         | Comment of ...
~~~~

However, just like for products, these more complicated types are
ultimately isomorphic to some nested series of `either`s.

In a lot of ways, variants are like an extension of enumeration types
(enums) in other languages. Enums in languages like Java also have a
series of tags, those tags just can’t have any values attached to them.
Here’s an example:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .Java}
public enum State {
  Running, Paused, Stopped
}
~~~~

This could be written with a variant by having constructors that do not
carry any values:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
type state = Running
           | Paused
           | Stopped
~~~~

These sorts of types are pretty useful, but not nearly as versatile as
full variants. For example, consider the option type which lets us make
values nullable:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
type 'a option = Some of 'a
               | None
~~~~

This is only possible because a variant’s constructor can carry a value.
It’s a very useful type in practice because it lets normal values in
OCaml not be nullable. As a quick reference, we could express this in
terms of our `either` type by making one of the branches hold `unit`:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
type 'a option = ('a, unit) either
Left value
Right ()
~~~~

Here, `Right ()` plays the role of the constructor `None`. Whenever we
see a constructor with no arguments, we can always express it as a
branch of an `either` with `unit`.

To actually get data *out* of a tagged union, we have to pattern match
on it providing a case for each possible constructor:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
match my_either with
  | Left a  -> ...
  | Right b -> ...
~~~~

Making Sense of Variants
------------------------

Products are an entirely natural programming construct: putting multiple
values together is something that emerges very naturally from any
non-trivial program we may want to write. On the other hand, variants
feel a bit more arbitrary: why the tags? Why not just a union type? I
think this is part of the reason why variants are uncommon in more
popular languages.

Compared to type unions, variants are generally safer: we always know
what we put in at runtime. In fact, quite often, C unions are used to
emulate variants with an explicit tag (hence the name “tagged union”):

~~~~ {.sourceCode .C}
enum Tag { Left; Right }

struct Either {
  enum Tag tag;
  union {
    int left;
    char* right;
  }
}
~~~~

The idea is to check the tag each time you read the value, to make sure
you’re getting the right sort of data from the `union`. Ultimately, this
reasonably common pattern amounts to jury-rigging variants on top of
enums and unions, without language support which makes it easier to make
mistakes.

In object-oriented programming, the [visitor design
pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern) serves a similar
role. The visitor pattern uses OO mechanisms to emulate pattern matching
in the OO language, letting us write variant-like code.

Already, we can see that variants aren’t completely arbitrary: one way
or another, they tend to emerge as a coding pattern of some sort. At the
same time, the fact that they emerge indirectly and often unacknowledged
means that it’s a less intuitive concept than a product.

Another way of looking at how products and variants fit together is in
terms of the “shape” of a product. What do I mean by that? Let’s start
by drawing some diagrams about the types involved. Given a pair `A × B`,
we have the two projection operations from it:

![image](http://espertech.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/product1.png?w=630)

But what makes `A × B` particularly special compared to any *other* type
`C` that also happens to have functions to `A` and `B`?

![image](http://espertech.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/product-cone1.png?w=630)

The core difference is that, in some sense, the product doesn’t carry
any additional information beyond that of its fields. The *only*
important things you can do with it are get the first value or get the
second value out. This is not necessarily true of some other type `C`,
even if it *does* let you get an `A` or a `B` out.

We can state this more formally as follows: for any type `C` with
functions `f : C → A` and `g : C → B`, there is *exactly one* function
`t : C → A × B` such that `π₁ (t c) = f c` and `π₂ (t c) = g c` for
every value `c` of type `C`. In other words, either of the possible
paths from `C` to `A` or `B` are equivalent (`t` is the function denoted
by a dotted line):

![image](http://espertech.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/product-limit1.png?w=630)

This might seem a bit weird, until you look at how we can define `t` in
general:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
let t c = (f c, g c)
~~~~

So really, this whole thing is a fancy way of saying that we can apply
both functions and put them into a tuple!

But why is this interesting? Well, it turns out that we can draw a very
similar diagram from a variant `A + B`. The only difference is that the
arrows are flipped! Otherwise, the same sort of relationships hold.

![image](http://espertech.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/coproduct-limit2.png?w=630)

So, in an abstract way, both products and variants have the same core
structure, with a particular kind of symmetry between them. Technically
speaking, they are **duals** of each other. To me, this symmetry is
strong evidence that variants really make sense: they’re just a natural
extension of products, which are entirely natural themselves.

This duality also makes certain other properties and behaviors of
algebraic data types emerge. Many languages have subtyping for records
(or record-like things—classes). The idea is simple: if we need
something with two fields `a` and `b`, we can always substitute in a
*bigger* record and just ignore the extra fields.

But how do we do subtyping with variants? Well, just like we flipped the
arrows in the diagrams, we flip the requirement: we can always
substitute in a *smaller* variant. In some sense, we get this
relationship for free just by acknowledging the duality of products and
variants. This is particularly relevant for OCaml because, unlike most
other languages, it actually supports this sort of subtyping directly in
the form of [polymorphic
variants](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-400/manual006.html).

Putting it all together
-----------------------

Products and variants together—with some nice syntax—give us algebraic
data types, which form a surprisingly expressive basis for modeling
different domains. We can write types that have multiple constructors,
each having multiple arguments:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
type foo = Foo of string * int
         | Bar of bool * float
         | Baz of int list
~~~~

Below the fancy syntax, this is still isomorphic to a bunch of nested
pairs and eithers. Reimplementing `foo` in these terms is a great
exercise to really understand this relationship.

One of the most direct ways in which algebraic data types like this are
useful is for working with abstract syntax trees. For example, here’s an
AST for the simply typed λ-calculus with basic arithmetic:
![image](http://espertech.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/ast.png?w=630)

We could represent it almost directly as an algebraic data type:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
type expr = Unit
          | Integer of int
          | Plus of expr * expr
          | Variable of name
          | Lambda of name * type * expr
          | App of expr * expr
~~~~

This makes for a definition that is fairly easy to follow, largely
because it reflects the “shape” of the domain (the grammar) well. This
becomes even more useful when you go to write an interpreter for this
language: the `eval` function also follows the shape of the algebraic
data type, guiding your implementation.

Another example in a similar vein is using an algebraic data type to
represent JSON:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .OCaml}
type json = Object of json StringMap
          | Array of json list
          | String of string
          | Number of float
          | True
          | False
          | Null
~~~~

Apart from being a concise definition that captures all of JSON, this
also makes traversing JSON values easy by pattern matching.

Ultimately, algebraic data types are just combinations of products and
variants, which turn out to be symmetric concepts. There really isn’t
much of a case for not including variants in your language when you
already have product types, whether they are tuples or structs or
records or even classes. They just fit too well together. And, from a
practical standpoint, the combination of the two is an expressive way to
declare the data types you’re working with.

    I think you have a typo :\
     In the sentence “The functions first and second are often
    abbreviated as fst and snd or π₁ and π₁ (π is used because these are
    projection functions).”, “π₁ and π₁” should be “π₁ and π₂”
