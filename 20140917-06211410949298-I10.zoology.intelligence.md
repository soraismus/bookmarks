Are dolphins cleverer than dogs?
================================

For decades now, dolphins and dogs have vied for the title of most
intelligent animal. But which is actually cleverer, and can the two even
be compared?

A lone bottlenose dolphin swam into the harbour at Tory Island off the
north coast of Ireland in April 2006. Her playfulness quickly earned her
an appreciative following among the locals who nicknamed her Duggie. Her
biggest fan was a Labrador retriever named Ben, who began swimming out
to meet her on a daily basis.

During a typical encounter, Ben would paddle frantically with his tail
wagging happily above the waves while Duggie blew giant bubble clouds
around his canine companion. Ask most people which of the two species in
this touching tale is the most intelligent and there is unlikely to be
much of a contest. Dolphins - with their sociability, communication
skills, playfulness and ability to understand the complex commands of
trainers – are widely considered to be the second most intelligent of
all animals after humans.

Yet recent years have seen a growing interest in canine cognition.
Researchers at institutes such as the [Duke Canine Cognition
Center](evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/research/dogs "Duke Canine Cognition Center"),
North Carolina, US, and the [Dog Cognition
Centre](http://www.port.ac.uk/department-of-psychology/facilities/dog-cognition-centre/ "Dog Cognition Centre")
at the University of Portsmouth, UK, are concluding there is far more
going on in the minds of dogs than we previously thought. In fact in
some cognitive tests they outwit both great apes and dolphins. So what
does the latest science say? Could dogs really be the intellectual
rivals of dolphins?

“There's lots of evidence that dogs are more skilled than primates at
thinking about a person's communicative intentions,” says [Laurie R.
Santos](psychology.yale.edu/faculty/laurie-r-santos "Laurie Santos"), a
psychologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, US, who
studies primates and canines to shed light on the human mind. “They
understand that people are trying to communicate information and use
such communicative signals way better than primates do.”

**Understanding us**

Dogs’ abilities to comprehend human communicative signals make them one
of the only animals to understand what people mean [when they point at
something](link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-005-0008-1 "Animal Cognition").
Even our cognitive cousins the chimpanzees don’t look past the tip of an
outstretched finger when a human points them in the direction of food. A
dog can use pointing as well as eye-direction cues to locate objects in
the distance. These abilities are rare in the animal kingdom, although
dolphins have them too, so on this test alone dogs don’t best them in a
contest of wits.

> Dolphins comprehend thousands of different sentences

There is however one cognitive feat at which dogs, somewhat
unexpectedly, outshine almost every other non-human animal. Chaser, a
Border Collie trained by US psychologists, is [reported to be able to
understand over 1,000
words](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635710002925 "Behavioural Processes")
used by her trainers to label her toys. When asked to fetch Bamboozle, a
stuffed orange horse, she is easily able to pick it out of a lineup of
other toys. She is even [able to understand simple
sentences](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029689 "PLoS One")
consisting of a preposition, two nouns, and a verb, like “to Frisbee
take ball” (take the ball to the Frisbee). With research showing the
famous language-trained apes like Kanzi the Bonobo top out at
vocabularies of less than half those of Chaser, and the dolphin language
prodigies from the [Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal
Laboratory](http://www.dolphin-institute.org "Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal Laboratory")
only managing about 40 words, dogs come out top when it comes to
learning the meaning of individual symbols.

**More than words**

But there’s more to language comprehension than just vocab. Although
Chaser was able to understand some basic syntax-like structure,
[scientists working with
dolphins](http://www.dolphin-institute.org/our_research/pdf/Herman%202012B.pdf "scientists working with dolphins")
have succeeded in combining up to five words in one sentence containing
complex concepts like “through” or “imitate.” This allows dolphins to
comprehend thousands of different sentences that involve much more
complex behaviour than simply “fetching.”

And unlike dogs, it seems that dolphins are keen problem solvers.

[In one
experiment](escholarship.org/uc/item/54x4b28g?query=can%20dolphins%20plan "In one experiment"),
dolphins were tasked with retrieving a series of weights scattered
around their pool which they had to place on top of a box in order to
release a food reward. Almost immediately they hit upon the idea of
collecting all of the weights at the same time instead of placing them
on the box one at a time. This apparent flash of insight suggests the
dolphins were planning their behaviour and turning over possible
solutions in their mind’s eye; a hallmark of complex thinking.

On top of this, dolphins are among the handful of animals that
understand they are looking at themselves when put in front of a mirror
(others include chimpanzees, elephants, and magpies). Researchers have
[used the mirror self-recognition
test](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/10/5937.short "PNAS") to determine
whether animals understand that they exist as separate entities in the
world, with their own thoughts and minds. This level of self-awareness
opens the door to greater flexibility in the face of new problems, or
when trying to figure out what’s going on inside the minds of other
animals. In this particular test of intelligence, dogs don’t make the
grade.

> Sometimes it just doesn't make sense to make comparisons

At first glance then, perhaps dolphins’ superior word-crunching skills,
problem solving, and self-awareness mean the gut instincts of those who
assume they outsmart dogs are supported by the evidence. But relying on
our gut to evaluate intelligence is problematic.

For one thing, the concept of human intelligence itself is an
ill-defined amalgamation of various different cognitive skills, and
efforts to evaluate it such as IQ tests are plagued by cultural bias. Is
someone who is good at solving algebraic equations more intelligent than
someone who can quickly determine the motivations of others? Is being
able to remember facts a mark of cleverness, and is it more or less
important than logical reasoning?

(credit: Deco / Alamy)

The difficulties such questions pose help explain why many scientists
object to subjective notions of human intelligence being applied to
non-human animals.

Furthermore, even if it were possible to agree on a constant and
universally-accepted definition of human intelligence, why should this
apply to non-human animals?

Dogs have been bred to thrive in a human-generated environment; they’re
particularly adept at reading human social cues, and tugging on human
heart strings. When we look into their eyes and see a glimmer of
intelligence, we see a reflection of our own minds. The skills at which
they excel – understanding pointing or object labels – are predominately
a result of humans having spent thousands of years breeding them to
understand concepts that are important to us. We are the architects of
their minds in many ways, and we’ve shaped them to conform to our
definitions of intelligence.

[](http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/130_73/images/live/p0/26/h0/p026h0dh.jpg "Dolphins live in a world mainly untouched by people (credit: Ivan Synieokov / Alamy)")

Dolphins, on the other hand, have evolved their cognitive skillset in a
world untouched by humans. Yet they seem intelligent to us because their
complex social behaviour reminds us of ourselves. We see reflections of
humanity in their playful demeanour and intricate societies. And when
scientists began digging into dolphin minds, they found abilities that
closely resembled that of our fellow great apes, such as mirror
self-recognition – an unexpected finding for an animal that looks more
like a tuna than a chimpanzee. Dolphins are perhaps the most human-like
of all non-primates, which is precisely why we consider them to be
intelligent.

**A question of intelligence**

“We know animals are shaped for certain specific kinds of cognitive
abilities by biology and evolution, so sometimes it just doesn't make
sense to make comparisons,” says Santos.

A dolphin’s mind evolved to produce behaviour that helps a dolphin cope
with dolphin problems, including finding fish buried in the sand with
echolocation, or only sleeping one half of their brain at a time so
they’re able to surface for a breath. The way a dolphin thinks is a
direct result of their physical, social, and ecological needs. The same
is true of dogs. And since each species has its own set of needs, each
species has its own unique way of thinking.

> Humans aren't necessarily ‘smarter’ than other primates

Humans have been shaped by the need to navigate complex social
situations and pass along learned information to our peers. This has
resulted in the evolution of language and culture, which coincided with
the rise of the kind of complex critical thinking that resulted in
things such as agriculture, technology and science, and ultimately space
exploration and nuclear fission. Granted, these things are extraordinary
by-products of the way we are able to think about information. But that
doesn’t make exchanging learned information the best or most intelligent
way of thinking.

“The idea is that humans aren't necessarily ‘smarter’ than other
primates so much as we're good at learning from others,” argues Santos.

Walker)

A good example of why intelligence is such a problematic term in this
context is to consider how different species perform in tests of object
permanence. This is the ability to understand that objects continue to
exist even when out of view. In the most complex version of the test, an
animal is shown an object such as a ball, which is then placed inside a
container and covered with a sheet. The ball is then removed from the
container while it is out of view, and the now empty container is pulled
from behind the sheet. If the animal has a full understanding of object
permanence, it should be able to work out what happened to the ball
while it was out of view, and realise that it must now be behind the
sheet.

**Thinking differently**

Human children work this out by the age of two, and other great apes
have no trouble figuring this out.
[Dogs](http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/spackled/2007readings/Dog_displace.pdf "Journal of Comparative Psychology")
and
[dolphins](link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-009-0250-z "Animal Cognition")
however just don’t get it. So does this mean dolphins and dogs are not
intelligent enough to have a full understanding of object permanence?

It could instead be a sign that dolphins and dogs think differently
rather than less intelligently about the problem. Primates are a visual
species, so our ability to visually track objects is how we relate to
the presence or non-presence of things around us. But dogs live in a
world of smells. Their understanding of objects in the world partly
involves chemical trails that linger for hours or days. Perhaps dogs
fail object permanence tests because objects that are no longer visually
there might have a continued chemical presence, which makes it difficult
for dogs to figure out what the researchers are asking of them.

[](http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/130_73/images/live/p0/26/h2/p026h298.jpg "Few animals understand the concept of pointing (credit: Jeff Rotman / NPL)")

Dolphins have visual systems that are similar to primates in many ways,
but they also have an extra sense that renders object permanence a
potentially troublesome concept. They are able to see through some
materials by penetrating them with sound waves. So a fish hiding in the
sand might be invisible to the naked eye, but be detectable to an
echolocating dolphin. Perhaps objects rarely – if ever – simply
disappear for dolphins.

It might then be that a dolphin’s brain [cannot easily
comprehend](https://www.cambridge.org/asia/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521845052&ss=fro "Spatial Cognition, Spatial Perception")
the idea of an object not being either visually or echoically
accessible. Or maybe they have a totally different understanding of how
objects move because they live in water where gravity sometimes plays
second fiddle to buoyancy. [A recent
study](link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-014-0788-2 "Animal Cognition")
found that dolphins can indeed pass the invisible displacement test
using 2D objects projected on a screen. Scientists now think that
dolphins were flummoxed in earlier studies by the idea of an object
disappearing into a container – a scenario that almost never occurs in
the wild. They seem to cope better with objects that pass behind – as
opposed to into – a visual barrier.

It’s interesting to ask why dogs and dolphins have a hard time with
object permanence, just as it’s interesting to wonder what Duggie and
Ben’s friendship might tell us about the way dolphins and dogs think
about the world. But ultimately, once subjective, human-centric value
judgments are stripped out of the concept of intelligence, it makes
about as much sense to ask which animal is cleverer as it does to ask
whether a hammer or a screwdriver is the better tool. The answer is it
depends on the task at hand.
