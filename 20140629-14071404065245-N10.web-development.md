Other than for historical reasons, is there is reason to have “www” in a
URL.\
 Should I do a permanent redirect from `www.xyz.com` to `xyz.com` or
`xyz.com` to `www.xyz.com`? Which one would you suggest and why?

One of the reasons why you need `www` or some other subdomain has to do
with a quirk of DNS and the CNAME record.

Suppose for the purposes of this example that you are running a big site
and contract out hosting to a CDN (Content Distribution Network) such as
Akamai. What you typically do is set up the DNS record for your site as
a CNAME to some `akamai.com` address. This gives the CDN the opportunity
to supply an IP address that is close to the browser (in geographic or
network terms). If you used an A record on your site, then you would not
be able to offer this flexibility.

The quirk of the DNS is that if you have a CNAME record for a host name,
you cannot have *any other* records for that same host. However, your
top level domain `example.com` usually must have an NS and SOA record.
Therefore, you cannot also add a CNAME record for `example.com`.

The use of `www.example.com` gives you the opportunity to use a CNAME
for `www` that points to your CDN, while leaving the required NS and SOA
records on `example.com`. The `example.com` record will usually also
have an A record to point to a host that will redirect to
`www.example.com` using an HTTP redirect.

You can provide a "default" CNAME record pointing to the CDN, you don't
have to use "www". This allows your DNS server to have SOA, NS, CNAME,
etc RRs all for the same domain name. – [Chris

How come nobody mentions the `ALIAS` (or `ANAME` records) in this kind
of topic? Doesn't it achieve the same results as the CNAME on
nakeddomain (except from the cookie issue...)? – [Augustin

One good technical reason to make `www.example.com` canonical is that
cookies of a main domain (i.e. `example.com`) are sent to all
subdomains.

So if your site uses cookies, they will be sent to all its subdomains.

Now, this often makes sense but it’s positively harmful if you only want
to download static resources. Consider all the style sheets and images
on your website: usually, there’s no reason to send cookies to the
server when requesting an image resource.

A good solution is therefore to use a subdomain for static resources,
such as `static.example.com`, to save bandwidth by not sending cookies.
All images and other static downloads can be downloaded from there. If
you now use `www.example.com` for the dynamic content, this means that
cookies only have to be sent to `www.example.com`, not to
`static.example.com`.

If, however, `example.com` is your main site, then cookies will be sent
to *all* subdomains, including `static.example.com`.

Now this isn’t relevant for most sites but changing your canonical URL
later on isn’t a good idea so once you settled for `example.com` instead
of `www.*`, you’re basically stuck with it.

An alternative is to use a *whole different* URL for static resources.
Stack Overflow for example uses `sstatic.net`, YouTube uses `ytimg.com`
etc. …

`www` is a subdomain usually used for the web server on a domain along
with others for other purposes such as `mail` etc. Nowadays, the
subdomain paradigm is unnecessary; if you connect to a website in a
browser, you'll get the website, or sending mail to the server will use
its mail service.

Using `www` or not is a matter of personal preference. Opposing points
of view can be found at [http://no-www.org/](http://no-www.org/) and
[http://www.yes-www.org/](http://www.yes-www.org/) - however, I believe
that `www` is unnecessary and just adds more cruft to the URI.

Most servers send the same site either way, but don't redirect. For SEO
purposes, choose one, then get the other to redirect to it. For example,
some PHP code to do this:

    if (preg_match('/www/', $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'])) {
      header("Location: http://azabani.com{$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']}");
      exit;
    }

However, some reasons promoting the use of a `www` subdomain made by
other answerers are great too, such as not sending cookies to static
servers (credit *Konrad Rudolph*).

I'd do the first. The `www` convention comes from the early days of HTTP
where www.cmu.edu and cmu.edu were very likely different machines.

in the 'early days' you'd rarely see an A record for a domain -- maybe
it'd have an MX record, but you rarely had a host there. – [Joe

If you are going to have subdomains for other purposes (blog for
instance), you may want to differentiate the sites and have a `www`
prefix for the regular site. Other then that, the only important thing
is to pick one of the two and stick to it (for SEO reasons).

Yes it will, unfortunately. You can't AJAX to `www.example.com` from
`example.com` or vice versa without something like JSONP. – [Delan

It's pretty historical. Once upon a time we used to have
www.example.com, ftp.example.com, images.example.com, uk.example.com etc
which seemed like a logical thing to do and provided a simple method to
spread the load between servers.

These days I would just go for example.com for the main site and
redirect the www version to that.

The [Google Webmaster tools allow you to specify your preferred
domain](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=44231),
so make sure you use those too.

Here is another minor perspective.

By not having www, there is a minor downside when it comes to text-based
media, whether printed or online, and that is getting it recognized as a
web address. In print, it’s usually pretty obvious that example.com is a
web address, and you can add styling touches to highlight that. But
plain text online? Not so easy. The chances are that if you send a plain
text message – whether email, tweet, Facebook post, SMS or whatever – it
will recognize a URL beginning with http:// or www. but won’t recognize
one without either of those. So in order to make the URL into a
clickable link, you have to either put www. or http:// on the front, and
of the two, www. is shorter, less clunky to look at and easier to read.

For system/network engineers, "www" == "http" == "tcp/80". This
nomenclature is interchangeable, because it's easy.

So it makes sense to manipulate "http" traffic at the DNS level, by
manipulating hosts or hostnames based on the "www" naming convention.

It is also an easy way to use shorthand when talking about a specific
ip:port socket.... I.e. "do you see www open on eth5?" would really mean
"do you see tcp/80 open to the world and accepting incoming connections
on the nic that registered with kernel as eth5?"

In other words, there is a lot going on behind the scene, and the ww
nomenclature is very useful IMHO. Especially when talking about caching
and ELB (I.e. hey Joey, how many healthy ww's do you see on site xyz?).

Obviously, ww's would have "ww" in their hostname, as db's have "db" in
their hostname. It is important to get this right from the get go. Once
a naming strategy is in place, it's hard to change it.
