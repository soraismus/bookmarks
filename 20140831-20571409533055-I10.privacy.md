This Man Has Nothing to Hide—Not Even His Email Password

If Noah Dyer has his way, everyone else will be stripped of any rights
to privacy too.

Issei Kato/Reuters

When someone debating privacy says, "but I don't have anything to hide,"
I am immediately suspicious. "Would you prove it by giving me access to
your email accounts," I've taken to replying, "along with your credit
card statements and bank records?" Not a single person has ever taken me
up on that challenge–until now.

Arizona resident Noah Dyer emailed me about an anti-privacy project he
is promoting. I replied in my usual way. And to my surprise, he sent all
his passwords.

"I have given you the things you’ve asked for, and have done so
unconditionally," he wrote. "I’ve given you the power to impersonate me.
I request that you do not take advantage of me in this way, though I
have obviously not made that desire a precondition to sharing the info
with you. Additionally, while you may paint whatever picture of me you
are inclined to based on the data and our conversations, I would ask you
to exercise restraint in embarrassing others whose lives have crossed my
path ... Again, I have not made your agreement to that request a
condition of sharing the data. I don’t think I have enough money that
you would bother to take it or spend it. Look forward to talking more
and seeing the article!"

"Wow," I thought. "How reckless to give this access to a complete
stranger!" Then I logged in to his email.

\* \* \*

Until age 21, Noah Dyer was a virgin. In fact, he'd never made it as far
as second base. A devout Mormon, he then married, had four children, and
decided that maybe there isn't a God after all. This caused him to
rethink all of his ethical beliefs. Now in his early thirties, he
insists that he hasn't changed much in the big picture.

"Zero is still the amount of times I've killed someone, robbed someone,
raped someone, taken illicit drugs, or even had alcohol or other
substances," he says. "What I did reevaluate and decided to change
drastically was my behavior in regard to sex. Don't get me wrong. I
loved my wife. I loved our sex. I was happy with all matters in our
relationship except for one thing. I really wanted to have sex with
other people. And in the absence of a jealous God who is overly
concerned about where I rub my genitals, I couldn't figure out why I
shouldn't."

Two years of counseling ensued. After much reflection, Dyer decided that
a polyamorous lifestyle was, in fact, for him. He is now a divorced
professor at a technical college with no credit cards and extremely
uninteresting finances, largely because the bulk of his paychecks are
directly deposited, per his preference, in the account of his ex-wife.

And having been transparent with his coreligionists about his loss of
faith and with his ex-wife about his lost willingness to be monogamous,
he gradually came to this life philosophy: Society would be better if no
one had any secrets. Email and bank accounts are just a small piece. A
person who truly had nothing to hide would also consent to footage being
captured when they're, say, fighting with their kids, sitting on the
toilet, masturbating, and negotiating with their boss for a pay raise.
Dyer is trying his damnedest to do just that. He doesn't necessarily
want you to see every moment, but doesn't think he should have a right
to stop you.

"In most societies, we [recognize] the right of people to keep secrets.
But really, there’s only one purpose for keeping secrets: secrets exist
to prevent other people from acting as they would if they had complete
information," he argues. So if his ambitious Kickstarter, "[A Year
Without
Privacy](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noahdyer/a-year-without-privacy-noahdyertv),"
is funded, "I will walk my talk. You will see every minute of my life
for a year. You will see every email, every text, every Facebook message
and any other communication that I receive. You will see my bank account
transaction and balances. You will see everything I eat and all the
exercise I do ... If I do have sex, it will be documented as a matter of
fact, not with any specific intention to arouse or otherwise manipulate
the viewer."

He figures he'll need around $300,000 to hire rotating camera crews, buy
them digital video equipment, and pay bandwidth costs for whoever wants
to tune in online. So far, he's raised just $628 for a fundraising
campaign that expires August 31, so odds are we won't have the chance to
see him teach computer programming classes, parent as a single father,
trim his nose hair, or browse Tinder.

Nor will we see a project intended to explore his novel approach to
political theory. As he sees it, all that is wasteful and corrupt in
U.S. governance is made possible by the ability of powerful actors to
cloak their bad behavior in secrecy. Advocating transparency in
government is, of course, a common enough position. So why does Dyer go
a step father, advocating a society where *everyone* is forced to be
transparent?

As he sees it, our insistence on a right to privacy empowers elites to
keep secrets. "The smartest people in any society will gain whatever
advantage they have over others—whatever the system is, they're going to
work it," he says. He sees information as a source of asymmetric
advantage, one used by corporate barons and other powerful people with
access to it. If only everyone had access to the same information, he
says, society would be fairer and more equal—we'd all be able to take
advantage of the best possible information.

He thinks most of us would live more ethically too. He is extremely
ethically consistent, adhering to his own value system far more than
most people, he explained. Yet he hypothesized that being recorded would
make him behave even better. "In my value system," he said, "I would see
my own kids three or four times a week." He thinks that's what is right
in his situation. "But over the summer, they were going on vacation with
their mom, I was going on vacation with them, they were going to
birthday parties—so I saw them once or twice a week for the last two
months. I don't like that. I'm not proud of it. Were my life being
constantly streamed, I might have made more of an effort to overcome the
logistical challenges."

A typical person given access to Dyer's email accounts would object less
to his missing a half-dozen summer days with his kids than to the
several married women with whom he has been intimate. Their unknowing
husbands would certainly feel that way.

I hasten to add that I didn't unearth that detail (or any others in this
story so far) via digital snooping or share it without the consent of my
subject. "Over the past 5 years, I have had sex with married women whose
husbands were not aware," he told me in the same initial message that
included his passwords. "I have missed child support payments, settled
debts, and probably done other stuff as well. Some of these things I
would do again in a world without privacy. Some of them I probably would
not. Some of them my co-conspirators would do again, others probably
not. But each of these decisions was made in an environment where the
understanding was that they would be kept private. I’m not advocating
that all activities made within that context should be revealed. I’m
arguing that a society that does so, going forward, will reap benefits
that outweigh the cons."
