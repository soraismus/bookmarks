The future of Wikipedia
-----------------------

### WikiPeaks?

The popular online encyclopedia must work out what is next
==========================================================

edition](/printedition/2014-03-01)

IN 2012, after 244 years in print, Encyclopedia Britannica became
online-only. Now a group of German fans of Wikipedia, an online,
user-generated encyclopedia, are raising money for a move in the
opposite direction. A print version of the English Wikipedia—1,000 bulky
volumes and 1,193,014 pages—will be on show at a gathering of
Wikipedians later this year. A world tour will probably follow: a global
victory lap for the internet’s most impressive crowd-sourced creation.

The books will be instantly out of date; several times a second an
article is amended online. But that is not the point. Wikipedia, which
was founded in 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, has a right to show
off. With articles on subjects as diverse as Spaghetti code (“a
pejorative term for source code”) and SpaghettiOs (“an American brand of
canned spaghetti”), it has 1,600 times as many articles as the
Encyclopedia Britannica. It is the world’s fifth most popular website,
with editions in 287 languages. (The English one is the biggest, with
4.4m articles.) On any given day 15% of all internet users visit it,
amounting to 495m readers a month.

Visitors to Wikipedia’s headquarters in downtown San Francisco, not far
from the buzzing offices of giant internet firms like Twitter, will find
an eerily silent workplace. The not-for-profit Wikimedia Foundation,
which oversees it, has around 170 employees. But its life blood is the
“community” of over 76,000 volunteers who create and update entries
remotely.

“Our job is to provide the sum of all knowledge,” says Erik Möller, the
foundation’s deputy director. But like an entry in a fast-changing
field, Wikipedia itself is due an update. After a year-long search, the
foundation is expected to name a new boss in March. The requirements are
stiff: the search committee recently admitted it had been looking for a
“unicorn”. He or she must ensure the non-profit’s financial future,
rebalance its content—and work out how to attract not only enough
contributors, but the right sort.

The current boss, Sue Gardner, transformed Wikipedia’s once-feeble
finances. When she started in 2007 the foundation had funds of just
$7.3m, a staff of 12 and headquarters in a dingy shopping centre in St
Petersburg, Florida. Last year it raised $50m from donations and grants.
The average reader donated 11 cents. Her replacement will have to decide
whether to establish an endowment to help ensure future financial
stability. And what about selling ads? “I would never say never, but
no,” says Lisa Seitz Gruwell, the foundation’s chief revenue officer.

![image](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/20140301_WBC461_1.png)

Wikipedia’s most pressing difficulty is finding and keeping
contributors, says Phoebe Ayers, who sits on the foundation’s board. The
number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third
in seven years (see chart). When Wikipedia was launched, one attraction
was being able to see updates straight away; now any teenager on
Facebook can experience that thrill. It also faces more competition for
volunteers’ time online.

Wanted: Wikipedians

Wikipedia is “starting to show the limits of the volunteer-only model”,
says William Beutler, the author of “The Wikipedian”, a blog. The fabled
grumpiness of established editors is one reason: “Please do not bite the
newcomers” runs a reminder on its noticeboard, presumably frequently
ignored. Last year it added a “thanks” feature, so editors can be
complimented for their work, rather than just harangued for errors on
message boards. But it still needs to do more, thinks Mr Beutler,
perhaps including paying contributors—though that would be resisted by
many Wikipedians, who fear creeping commercialisation. A decade ago, the
mere discussion of taking advertising caused a schism, with a purist
Spanish version splitting off.

A greater diversity of writers would be welcome, too. Today’s bunch are
90% male and mostly from rich countries. One consequence is coverage
that is comprehensive on science and technology, but patchy on poorer
regions and social issues. A recent analysis found that only 2.6% of its
“geo-tagged” articles are about Africa, which accounts for 14% of the
world’s population. Various groups are trying to make its coverage less
skewed, in different ways. On March 4th the Royal Society in London will
hold an event to update articles on women scientists, which tend to be
incomplete or even non-existent.

Wikipedia wants more readers, too, especially in places where
information is in short supply. In some languages—for example Malagasy,
Madagascar’s national language—it is almost the only reference work and
a valuable “cultural repository”, says Ethan Zuckerman of MIT’s Media
Lab. Through a project called Wikipedia Zero, mobile operators in 25
countries, including Cameroon, Malaysia and South Africa, supply
Wikipedia free to smartphone users. A pilot programme in Kenya lets
owners of phones that are too basic for internet browsing receive
entries by text message.

As if all that were not enough, Wikipedia’s new boss will also need to
work out how the transmission of knowledge should keep pace with
changing patterns of consumption. It is trying to follow the shift from
personal computers, for example, by making it easier to edit articles on
mobile devices. But only the most devoted will spend their commutes
editing entries instead of playing Angry Birds. And what will Wikipedia
be, when information can be supplied by voice or wearable devices like
Google Glass, asks Jeff Jarvis of the City University of New York’s
journalism department? If it is as popular then as it is now, another
victory lap will be in order.

**Correction**: We slightly underestimated the number of
foreign-language editors in the chart that ran in print. This has been
corrected online
