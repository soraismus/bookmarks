The Logic of Real and Complex Numbers
-------------------------------------

I’ve always liked logic. I studied it a bunch in high school and
college. Nowadays it’s a kind of hobby. I turn to it for relief
sometimes when I become frustrated trying to figure out what I can do
about global warming. Lately I’ve been digging a bit deeper into the
logic behind the real and complex numbers. And I’m teaching a graduate
course on real analysis this fall, so I actually have a slight excuse
for doing this.

There’s something about logic that’s both fascinated and terrified me
ever since I was a kid: it’s how we can’t fully pin down infinite
structures, like the real or complex number systems, using a language
with finitely many symbols and a theory with finitely many axioms.

It’s terrifying that we don’t fully know what we’re talking about when
we’re talking about numbers! But it’s fascinating that we can understand
a lot about the limitations.

There are many different things to say about this, depending on what
features of these number systems we want to describe, and what kind of
logic we want to use.

Maybe I should start with the natural numbers, since that story is more
famous. This can also serve as a lightning review of some basic concepts
which I’ll pretend you already vaguely know:
[first-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic) versus
[second-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_logic) logic,
[proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory) versus
[models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory), and so on. If you
don’t know these, you can either fake it or read some of the many links
in this article!

### Natural numbers

When Peano originally described the natural numbers he did so using
axioms phrased in second-order logic. In [first-order
logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic) we can quantify
over variables: for example, we can say

![\\forall x \\; (P(x)) \\; \\Rightarrow \\; P(y)
\\;](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cforall+x+%5C%3B+%28P%28x%29%29+%5C%3B+%5CRightarrow+%5C%3B+P%28y%29+%5C%3B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\forall x \; (P(x)) \; \Rightarrow \; P(y) \;")

which means that if the predicate
![P](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P")
holds for all
![x](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x") it
holds for any variable
![y.](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y.&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "y.")
In [second-order
logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_logic) we can also
quantify over predicates: for example, we can say

![\\forall P \\; (P(x) \\Leftrightarrow P(y)) \\; \\Leftrightarrow \\; x
=
y](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cforall+P+%5C%3B+%28P%28x%29+%5CLeftrightarrow+P%28y%29%29+%5C%3B+%5CLeftrightarrow+%5C%3B+x+%3D+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\forall P \; (P(x) \Leftrightarrow P(y)) \; \Leftrightarrow \; x = y")

which says that ![x =
y](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x = y")
if and only if for every predicate
![P,](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%2C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P,")
![P(x)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P(x)")
is true precisely when
![P(y)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28y%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P(y)")
is true. Leibniz used this principle, called [the identity of
indiscernibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles),
to *define* equality… and this is a nice example of the greater power of
second-order logic. In first-order logic we typically include equality
as part of the language and add axioms describing its properties, like

![\\forall x \\; \\forall y \\; (x = y \\Leftrightarrow y =
x)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cforall+x+%5C%3B+%5Cforall+y+%5C%3B+%28x+%3D+y+%5CLeftrightarrow+y+%3D+x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\forall x \; \forall y \; (x = y \Leftrightarrow y = x)")

In second-order logic we can *define* equality and *prove* these
properties starting from the properties we already have for
![\\Leftrightarrow.](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CLeftrightarrow.&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\Leftrightarrow.")

Anyway, in his axioms for the natural numbers, Peano used second-order
logic to formulate the principle of mathematical induction in this sort
of way:

![\\forall P \\; \\big[ P(0) \\; \\& \\; \\forall n \\; ((P(n)
\\Rightarrow P(n+1)) \\; \\; \\Rightarrow \\; \\; \\forall n \\;
P(n))\\big]](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cforall+P+%5C%3B+%5Cbig%5B+P%280%29+%5C%3B+%5C%26+%5C%3B+%5Cforall+n+%5C%3B+%28%28P%28n%29+%5CRightarrow+P%28n%2B1%29%29+%5C%3B+%5C%3B+%5CRightarrow+%5C%3B+%5C%3B+%5Cforall+n+%5C%3B+P%28n%29%29%5Cbig%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\forall P \; \big[ P(0) \; \& \; \forall n \; ((P(n) \Rightarrow P(n+1)) \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; \forall n \; P(n))\big]")

This says that if you’ve got any predicate that’s true for
![0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "0") and
is true for
![n+1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n+1")
whenever it’s true for
![n,](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n,")
then it’s true for all natural numbers.

In 1888, Dedekind showed that Peano’s original axioms for the natural
numbers are
**[categorical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms#Models)**,
meaning all its models are isomorphic.

The concept of
[‘model’](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/model-theory/) involves set
theory. In a model you pick a set
![S](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "S") for
your variables to range over, pick a subset of
![S](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "S") for
each predicate—namely the subset where that predicate is true —and so
on, in such a way that all the axioms in that theory are satisfied. If
two models are isomorphic, they’re the same for all practical purposes.

So, in simple rough terms, a categorical theory is one that gives a
*full* description of the mathematical structure it’s talking about.

This makes Dedekind’s result sound like great news. It sounds like
Peano’s original second-order axioms for arithmetic completely describe
the natural numbers.

However, there’s an important wrinkle. There are many inherently
undetermined things about set theory! So in fact, a categorical theory
only gives a full description of the mathematical structure it’s talking
about *relative to a choice of what sets are like*.

So, Dedekind’s result just shoves everything mysterious and undetermined
about the natural numbers under the carpet: they become mysterious and
undetermined things about set theory. This became clear much later,
thanks to Gödel and others. And in the process, it became clear that
second-order logic is a bit problematic compared to first-order logic.

You see, first-order logic has deduction rules that are:

• **[sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness)**: Every provable
sentence holds in every model.

• **[semantically
complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_%28logic%29):**
Every sentence that holds in every model is provable.

• **[effective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method):** There
is an algorithm that can correctly decide whether any given sequence of
symbols is a valid proof.

Second-order logic does not! It’s ‘too powerful’ to also have all three
of these nice properties.

So, these days people often work with a first-order version of Peano’s
axioms for arithmetic. Instead of writing down a single axiom for
mathematical induction:

![\\forall P \\; \\big[ P(0) \\; \\& \\; \\forall n \\; P(n)
\\Rightarrow P(n+1)) \\; \\; \\Rightarrow \\;\\; \\forall n \\;
(P(n))\\big]](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cforall+P+%5C%3B+%5Cbig%5B+P%280%29+%5C%3B+%5C%26+%5C%3B+%5Cforall+n+%5C%3B+P%28n%29+%5CRightarrow+P%28n%2B1%29%29+%5C%3B+%5C%3B+%5CRightarrow+%5C%3B%5C%3B+%5Cforall+n+%5C%3B+%28P%28n%29%29%5Cbig%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\forall P \; \big[ P(0) \; \& \; \forall n \; P(n) \Rightarrow P(n+1)) \; \; \Rightarrow \;\; \forall n \; (P(n))\big]")

we write down an [axiom
schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema)—an infinite list of
axioms—with one axiom like this:

![\\phi(0) \\; \\& \\; \\forall n \\; (\\phi(n) \\Rightarrow \\phi(n+1))
\\; \\; \\Rightarrow \\;\\; \\forall n \\;
(\\phi(n))](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%280%29+%5C%3B+%5C%26+%5C%3B+%5Cforall+n+%5C%3B+%28%5Cphi%28n%29+%5CRightarrow+%5Cphi%28n%2B1%29%29+%5C%3B+%5C%3B+%5CRightarrow+%5C%3B%5C%3B+%5Cforall+n+%5C%3B+%28%5Cphi%28n%29%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\phi(0) \; \& \; \forall n \; (\phi(n) \Rightarrow \phi(n+1)) \; \; \Rightarrow \;\; \forall n \; (\phi(n))")

for each formula
![\\phi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\phi")
that we can actually write down using the language of arithmetic.

This first-order version of Peano arithmetic is *not* categorical: it
has lots of nonisomorphic models. People often pretend there’s one
‘best’ model: they call it the ‘standard’ natural numbers, and call all
the others ‘nonstandard’. But there’s something a bit fishy about this.

Indeed, [Gödel’s first incompleteness
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems#First_incompleteness_theorem)
says there are many statements about natural numbers that can neither be
proved nor disproved starting from Peano’s axioms. It
[follows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem)
that for any such statement we can find a model of the Peano axioms in
which that statement holds, and also a model in which it does not.

Furthermore, this remains true even if we add any list of extra axioms
to Peano arithmetic, as long as there’s some algorithm that can list all
these axioms.

So, I’d prefer to say there are many different ‘versions’ of the natural
numbers, just as there are many different groups.

We can study these different versions, and it’s a fascinating subject:

• Wikipedia, [Nonstandard models of
arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_model_of_arithmetic).

However, I want to talk about the situation for other number systems!

### The real numbers

The situation is better for the real numbers—at least if we are willing
to think about them in a ‘purely algebraic’ way, leaving most analysis
behind.

To do this, we can use the theory of a ‘real closed field’. This is a
list of axioms, formulated in first-order logic, which describe how ![+,
\\times, 0,
1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C+%5Ctimes%2C+0%2C+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "+, \times, 0, 1")
and
![\\le](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cle&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\le")
work for the real numbers. You can think of these axioms as consisting
of three parts:

• the **[field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_%28mathematics%29)**
axioms: the usual algebraic identities involving ![+, \\times,
0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C+%5Ctimes%2C+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "+, \times, 0")
and ![1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "1")
together with laws saying that everything has an additive inverse and
everything except
![0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "0") has
a multiplicative inverse.

• the **[formally real
field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formally_real_field)** axiom,
saying that
![-1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "-1")
is not the square of anything. This implies that we can equip the field
with a concept of
![\\le](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cle&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\le")
that makes it into an [ordered
field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field)—but not necessarily
in a unique way.

• the **[real closed
field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_closed_field)** axioms, which
says that also for any number
![x,](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x,")
either
![x](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x") or
![-x](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "-x")
has a square root, and every polynomial of odd degree has a root. Among
other things this implies our field can be made into an ordered field in
a unique way. To do this, we say ![x \\le
y](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cle+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x \le y")
if and only if ![y -
x](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+-+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "y - x")
has a square root.

Tarski showed this theory is
**[complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_theory)**: any
first-order sentence involving only the operations ![+, \\times, 0,
1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C+%5Ctimes%2C+0%2C+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "+, \times, 0, 1")
and the relation
![\\le](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cle&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\le")
can either be proved or disproved starting from the above axioms.

Nonetheless, the theory of real closed fields is not categorical:
besides the real numbers, there are many other models! These models are
all **[elementarily
equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_equivalence)**: any
sentence involving just ![+, \\times, 0, 1,
\\le](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C+%5Ctimes%2C+0%2C+1%2C+%5Cle&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "+, \times, 0, 1, \le")
and first-order logic that holds in one model holds in all the rest. But
these models are not all isomorphic: we can’t get a bijection between
them that preserves ![+, \\times, 0,
1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C+%5Ctimes%2C+0%2C+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "+, \times, 0, 1")
and
![\\le.](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cle.&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\le.")

Indeed, only finite-sized mathematical structures can be ‘nailed down’
up to isomorphism by theories in first-order logic. You see, the
**[Löwenheim–Skolem
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6wenheim%E2%80%93Skolem_theorem)**
says that if a first-order theory in a countable language has an
infinite model, it has at least one model of each infinite cardinality.
So, if we’re trying to use this kind of theory to describe an infinitely
big mathematical structure, the most we can hope for is that *after we
specify its cardinality*, the axioms completely determine it.

However, the real closed field axioms aren’t even this good. For
starters, they have infinitely many nonisomorphic *countable* models.
Here are a few:

• the **[algebraic real
numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number)**: these are
the real numbers that obey polynomial equations with integer
coefficients.

• the **[computable real
numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_number)**: these are
the real numbers that can be computed to arbitrary precision by a
computer program.

• the **[arithmetical real
numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definable_real_number#Language_of_arithmetic)**:
these are the numbers definable in the language of arithmetic. More
precisely, a real number
![x](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x") is
**arithmetical** if there is a formula
![\\phi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\phi")
in the language of first-order Peano arithmetic, with two free
variables, such that

![\\displaystyle{ \\forall m \\; \\forall n \\; (\\frac{m}{n} \\le x \\;
\\; \\Leftrightarrow \\; \\; \\phi(n,m)) }
](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cforall+m+%5C%3B+%5Cforall+n+%5C%3B+%28%5Cfrac%7Bm%7D%7Bn%7D+%5Cle+x+%5C%3B+%5C%3B+%5CLeftrightarrow+%5C%3B+%5C%3B+%5Cphi%28n%2Cm%29%29+%7D+&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\displaystyle{ \forall m \; \forall n \; (\frac{m}{n} \le x \; \; \Leftrightarrow \; \; \phi(n,m)) } ")

Every computable real number is arithmetical, but not vice versa: just
because you can define a real number in the above way does not mean you
can actually compute it to arbitrary precision!

And indeed, there are other even bigger countable real closed fields,
consisting of real numbers that are
[definable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definable_real_number) using
more powerful methods, like second-order Peano arithmetic.

We can also get countable real closed fields using tricks like this:
take the algebraic real numbers and throw in the number
![\\pi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi")
along with just enough other numbers to get a real closed field again.
Or, we could throw in both
![\\pi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi")
and
![e.](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e.&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "e.")
This probably gives a bigger real closed field—but nobody knows, because
for all we know,
![\\pi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi")
could equal
![e](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "e")
plus some rational number! Everyone *believes* this is false, but nobody
has proved it.

There are also lots of nonisomorphic *uncountable* real closed fields,
including ones that include the usual real numbers.

For example, we can take the real numbers and throw in an element
![\\infty](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\infty")
that is bigger than ![1, 2, 3,
\\dots,](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+%5Cdots%2C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "1, 2, 3, \dots,")
and so on—and then do what it takes to get another real closed field.
This involves throwing in elements like

![-\\infty, \\; \\infty + 1, \\; 1/\\infty, \\; \\infty\^2, \\;
\\sqrt{\\infty}, \\; \\sqrt{\\infty\^2 + 17} ,
\\dots](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Cinfty%2C+%5C%3B+%5Cinfty+%2B+1%2C+%5C%3B+1%2F%5Cinfty%2C+%5C%3B+%5Cinfty%5E2%2C+%5C%3B+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cinfty%7D%2C+%5C%3B+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cinfty%5E2+%2B+17%7D+%2C+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "-\infty, \; \infty + 1, \; 1/\infty, \; \infty^2, \; \sqrt{\infty}, \; \sqrt{\infty^2 + 17} , \dots")

and so on. So, we get lots of infinities and infinitesimals.

It gets a bit confusing here, trying to figure out what equals what. But
there’s another real closed field containing an infinite element that
seems easier to manage. It’s called the field of **[real Puiseux
series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puiseux_series)**. These are
series of the form

![\\sum\_{i = k}\^\\infty a\_i
z\^{i/n}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum_%7Bi+%3D+k%7D%5E%5Cinfty+a_i+z%5E%7Bi%2Fn%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\sum_{i = k}^\infty a_i z^{i/n}")

where
![k](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "k") is
any integer, perhaps negative,
![n](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n") is
any\
 positive integer, and the coefficients
![a\_i](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_i&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a_i")
are real.

What’s
![z?](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "z?")
It’s just a formal variable. But the real Puiseux series are real closed
field, and
![z](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "z")
acts like
![1/\\infty:](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F%5Cinfty%3A&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "1/\infty:")
it’s positive, but smaller than any positive real number.

With considerably more work, we can make up a real closed field that:

• contains the real numbers,

• contains an element
![\\infty](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\infty")
bigger than ![1,2,3,
\\dots,](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2C2%2C3%2C+%5Cdots%2C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "1,2,3, \dots,")
and

• obeys the **[transfer
principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_principle#Transfer_principle_for_the_hyperreals)**,
which says that a first-order statement phrased in the usual language of
set theory holds for the real numbers if and only if it holds for this
other number system.

Any real closed field with these properties is called a system of
**[hyperreal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number)**.
In the 1960s, the logician Abraham Robinson used them to make Leibniz’s
old idea of infinitesimals in calculus fully rigorous. The resulting
theory is called **[nonstandard
analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_analysis)**.

So, I hope you see there’s an exciting—or perhaps appalling—diversity of
real closed fields. But don’t forget: they’re all elementarily
equivalent. If a sentence involving just ![+, \\times, 0,
1,](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C+%5Ctimes%2C+0%2C+1%2C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "+, \times, 0, 1,")
![\\le](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cle&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\le")
and first-order logic holds in any one of these real closed fields, it
holds in all of them!

You might wonder what second-order logic has to say about this.

Here the situation looks very different. In second-order logic we can do
analysis, because we can quantify over *predicates*, which allows us to
talk about subsets of real numbers. And in second-order logic we can
write down a theory of real numbers that’s categorical! It’s called the
theory of a **[Dedekind-complete ordered
field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#Definition)**. Again,
we can group the axioms in three bunches:

• the **[field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_%28mathematics%29)**
axioms: the usual algebraic identities involving ![+, \\times,
0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C+%5Ctimes%2C+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "+, \times, 0")
and ![1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "1")
together with laws saying that everything has an additive inverse and
everything except
![0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "0") has
a multiplicative inverse.

• the **[ordered field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field)**
axiom, saying there is a total ordering
![\\le](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cle&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\le")
such that ![x \\le
y](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cle+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x \le y")
and ![x' \\le
y'](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%27+%5Cle+y%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x' \le y'")
implies ![x + x' \\le y +
y'](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%2B+x%27+%5Cle+y+%2B+y%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x + x' \le y + y'")
and ![x,y \\ge
0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy+%5Cge+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x,y \ge 0")
implies ![x y \\ge
0.](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+y+%5Cge+0.&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x y \ge 0.")

• the **[Dedekind
completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_of_the_real_numbers)**
axiom, which says that every nonempty subset with an upper bound has a
least upper bound. But instead of talking about subsets, we talk about
the predicates that hold on those subsets, so we say “for all predicates
![P](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P")
such that…”

Because they’re categorical, people often use these axioms to define the
real numbers. But because they’re second-order, the problem of many
nonisomorphic models has really just been swept under the rug. If we use
second-order logic, we won’t have a concept of ‘proof’ that’s sound,
semantically complete and effective. And if we use first-order axioms
for set theory to explicitly talk about subsets instead of predicates,
then our set theory will have many models! *Each model* will have a
version of the real numbers in it that’s unique up to isomorphism… but
the versions in different models will be really different.

In fact, there’s a precise sense in which the ‘standard reals numbers’
in one model of set theory can be the ‘hyperreals’ in another. This was
first shown by Abraham Robinson.

### The complex numbers

I mentioned that when wefc’re studying an infinite mathematical
structure using first-order logic, the best we can hope for is to have
one model *of each size*, up to isomorphism. The real numbers are far
from being this nice… but the complex numbers come much closer!

More precisely, say
![\\kappa](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ckappa&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\kappa")
is some cardinal. A first-order theory describing structure on a single
set is called
**[κ-categorical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morley%27s_categoricity_theorem)**
if it has a unique model of cardinality
![\\kappa.](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ckappa.&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\kappa.")
And 1965, a logician named Michael Morley showed that if a list of
axioms is
![\\kappa](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ckappa&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\kappa")-categorical
for *some* uncountable
![\\kappa,](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ckappa%2C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\kappa,")
it’s
![\\kappa](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ckappa&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\kappa")-categorical
for *every* uncountable
![\\kappa.](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ckappa.&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\kappa.")
I haven’t worked my way through the proof, which seems to be full of
interesting ideas. But such theories are called **[uncountably
categorical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morley%27s_categoricity_theorem#History_and_motivation)**.

A great example is the ‘purely algebraic’ theory of the complex numbers.
By this I mean we only write down axioms involving ![+, \\times,
0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C+%5Ctimes%2C+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "+, \times, 0")
and
![1.](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1.&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "1.")
We don’t include anything about
![\\le](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cle&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\le")
this time, nor anything about complex conjugation. You see, if we start
talking about complex conjugation we can pick out the real numbers
inside the complex numbers, and then we’re more or less back to the
story we had for real numbers.

This theory is called the theory of an **algebraically closed field of
characteristic zero**. Yet again, the axioms come in three bunches:

• the **[field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_%28mathematics%29)**
axioms.

• the **[characteristic
zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_%28algebra%29)**
axiom schema: this is an infinite list of axioms saying that

![1 \\ne 0, \\quad 1+1 \\ne 0, \\quad 1+1+1 \\ne 0, \\dots
](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%5Cne+0%2C+%5Cquad+1%2B1+%5Cne+0%2C+%5Cquad+1%2B1%2B1+%5Cne+0%2C+%5Cdots+&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "1 \ne 0, \quad 1+1 \ne 0, \quad 1+1+1 \ne 0, \dots ")

• the **[algebraically
closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraically_closed_field)**
axiom: this says that every non-constant polynomial has a root.

Pretty much any mathematician worth their salt knows that the complex
numbers are a model of these axioms, whose cardinality is that of the
continuum. There are lots of different countable models: the algebraic
complex numbers, the computable complex numbers, and so on. But because
the above theory is uncountably categorical, there is *exactly one*
algebraically closed field of characteristic zero of *each* uncountable
cardinality… up to isomorphism.

This implies some interesting things.

For example, we can take the complex numbers, throw in an extra element,
and let it freely generate a bigger algebraically closed field. It’s
‘bigger’ in the sense that it contains the complex numbers as a proper
subset, indeed a subfield. But since it has the same cardinality as the
complex numbers, it’s *isomorphic* to the complex numbers!

And then, because this ‘bigger’ field is isomorphic to the complex
numbers, we can turn this argument around. We can take the complex
numbers, remove a lot of carefully chosen elements, and get a subfield
that’s isomorphic to the complex numbers.

Or, if we like, we can take the complex numbers, adjoin a *really huge*
set of extra elements, and let them freely generate an algebraically
closed field of characteristic zero. The cardinality of this field can
be as big as we want. It will be determined up to isomorphism by its
cardinality.

One piece of good news is that thanks to a [result of
Tarski](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~gp351/acf-qe.pdf), the theory of an
algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is
[complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_theory), and thus, all
its models are elementarily equivalent. In other words, all the same
first-order sentences written in the language of ![+, \\times,
0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C+%5Ctimes%2C+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "+, \times, 0")
and ![1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "1")
hold in every model.

But here’s a piece of *strange* news.

As I already mentioned, the theory of a real closed field is *not*
uncountably categorical. This implies something really weird. Besides
the ‘usual’ real numbers
![\\mathbb{R}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{R}")
we can choose another real closed field
![\\mathbb{R}',](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%27%2C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{R}',")
not isomorphic to
![\\mathbb{R},](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%2C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{R},")
with the same cardinality. We can build the complex numbers
![\\mathbb{C}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{C}")
using pairs of real numbers. We can use the same trick to build a field
![\\mathbb{C}'](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{C}'")
using pairs of guys in
![\\mathbb{R}'.](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%27.&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{R}'.")
But it’s easy to check that this funny field
![\\mathbb{C}'](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{C}'")
is algebraically closed and of characteristic zero. Since it has the
same cardinality as
![\\mathbb{C},](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%2C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{C},")
it must be isomorphic to
![\\mathbb{C}.](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D.&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{C}.")

In short, different ‘versions’ of the real numbers can give rise to the
*same* version of the complex numbers!

So, I hope you see that the logical foundations of the real and complex
number systems are quite slippery… yet with work, we can understand a
lot about this slipperiness.

categorical theories:

    While hardly the same thing, the “strange news” is reminiscent of
    the following. There are uncountably many fake R\^4s, homeomorphic
    but not diffeomorphic to the standard R\^4. Take one and cross it
    with R. Now it’s diffeomorphic to R\^5, since there’s only one! To
    what closed smooth submanifold of R\^5 does Fake x 0 go under this
    diffeomorphism?

    John, it looks like you’re saying that in Peano’s second-order
    logic, mathematical induction (MI) is an axiom rather than a
    theorem. If so, why did Peano not incorporate enough logical power
    in his system to \*prove\* MI?

    Is it because any attempt to do so must in effect assume MI (in
    which case my hand should have obnoxiously shot up when our high
    school teacher argued for its truth)? Or is it because any attempt
    to do so results in contradiction? Or, …?

        In most approaches to the natural numbers, mathematical
        induction is an axiom rather than a theorem!

        You can think of mathematical induction as a way of saying that
        every natural number is either 0, or 1, or 1+1, or 1+1+1, or…
        something like this, with some natural number of 1’s.

        This is the key fact about natural numbers, but it’s hard to
        state this fact in a non-circular way—you’ll notice I just said
        it in a circular way. Mathematical induction is a way of saying
        it in a non-circular way!

        We can prove mathematical induction as a theorem—but as far as I
        know, only if we start from some axiom that’s really
        mathematical induction in disguise.

        For example, we can assume that the natural numbers come with a
        concept of ≤ obeying some plausible axioms, and then add an
        axiom saying that “every nonempty set of natural numbers has a
        least element”. This is called the **well-ordering principle**.

        Given the other axioms we can use the well-ordering principle to
        prove mathematical induction… but we can also use mathematical
        induction to prove the well-ordering principle, so after some
        thought you’ll realize they are the same idea in two disguises:

        • Wikipedia, [Mathematical induction: equivalence with the
        well-ordering
        principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction#Equivalence_with_the_well-ordering_principle).

        Finally, I should warn you that even the principle of
        mathematical induction is not powerful enough to completely
        break the circularity of saying “every natural number is either
        0, or 1, or 1+1, or 1+1+1, or… something like this, with some
        natural number of 1’s”. The point is that nonstandard versions
        of the natural numbers obey the principle of mathematical
        induction but have numbers bigger than all the ‘standard’
        natural numbers.

            Thanks John. If I understand the first part of your reply
            you’re saying that my math teacher must have effectively
            assumed MI when arguing for its truth.

            I do recall my teacher implicitly assuming that every
            natural number can be reached by repeatedly adding 1. But
            looking at the wikipedia article on the Peano Axioms,
            invoking the successor function S() on a natural number
            appears to be the only way to generate a natural number
            other than the one (call it 0) that is given us for free.

            If that’s right, how could my teacher’s assumption be false
            – how could there possibly be a natural number that isn’t
            either the one we’re given for free, or the result of
            (possibly repeated applications of) the only permitted means
            of generating a new one?

                As a teacher, when you try to teach students a rather
                complicated axiom like mathematical induction, you
                typically use their previous experience—in this case,
                their experience with the natural numbers—to coax them
                into seeing the axiom as ‘reasonable’ and ‘believable’.
                This is completely different than proving a theorem:
                it’s a matter of persuasion rather than proof. A really
                good teacher will (at least for sufficiently advanced
                students) explain the difference.

                > If that’s right, how could my teacher’s assumption be
                > false—how could there possibly be a natural number

                Everyone agrees that the only natural numbers are zero
                and its successors:

                ![0, S(0), S(S(0)),
                \\dots](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0%2C+S%280%29%2C+S%28S%280%29%29%2C+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "0, S(0), S(S(0)), \dots")

                and this is why mathematical induction is true. The
                problem is that it’s impossible turn this into a
                rigorous proof. Why not? Because it’s impossible to say
                precisely what
                ![\\dots](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\dots")
                means without a theory of natural numbers!

                In other words, you can’t make your idea of ***repeated
                applications*** precise without using precisely the
                ideas about natural numbers that you’re trying to
                explain, or prove. As I said:

                You might try to get around it this way: say that every
                natural number that’s not zero is the successor of some
                natural number. In fact this is an axiom of Peano
                arithmetic. However, this axiom is not enough to imply
                mathematical induction. You might enjoy figuring out
                why.

                Thanks John. I guess the stumbling block in attempting
                to use the axiom you mention (“every natural number
                that’s not zero is the successor of some natural
                number”) to prove mathematical induction is at bottom
                the same thing that tripped us up before, because the
                ‘predecessor chain’ from an arbitrary natural number
                back to 0, being of arbitrary length, can’t be
                accomodated in any given proof without resorting to some
                equivalent of “…”.

                BTW I don’t see your axiom among the Peano axioms in
                Wikipedia. Maybe it’s part of an alternative
                formulation. (Then again, I find the axioms I \*do\* see
                there sufficiently puzzling – e.g. \#7’s restatement
                suggests that “=” is intended to denote identity, but
                wouldn’t that render \#5 redundant? – that it’s just as
                likely I’m mentally wedged again:-))

                Right.

                Whoops! I was being silly; this follows from the other
                axioms using mathematical induction, in a very simple
                and amusing way. Let

                P(n) = “either n = 0 or n = S(m) for some m”

                where S means “successor”. Then

                ∀n P(n)

                says that every number except zero is a successor. Let’s
                prove it by induction.

                It’s really easy to check that P(0) is true, since 0 =
                0, and it’s really easy to check that

                P(n) ⇒ P(S(n))

                since P(S(n)) is always true: S(n) is the successor of
                n. So, by mathematical induction we get

                ∀n P(n)

                It’s in [Robinson
                arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_arithmetic#Axioms),
                a system that leaves out mathematical induction, that we
                need an axiom saying every number except zero is a
                successor.

                The Wikipedia article on [Peano
                arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms)
                says this about axioms 2-5 in Peano’s original
                treatment. These axioms are about equality:

                > Since they are logically valid in first-order logic
                > with equality, they are not considered to be part of
                > “the Peano axioms” in modern treatments.

                Indeed, axioms 2-4 are considered part of first-order
                logic, while axiom 5 is completely irrelevant to the
                modern form of the Peano axioms, which talk about
                *nothing except* natural numbers. It’s better to look at
                the [modern form of the Peano
                axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms#First-order_theory_of_arithmetic).

                I considered saying that, because there’s some truth to
                it: presumably you’re referring to the fact that the
                second-order Peano axioms are categorical.

                But the concept of ‘categorical theory’ is a
                model-theoretic concept, so it brings in set theory.
                When we take models of a theory in second-order logic,
                the models we get depend on the set theory we use… and
                the ‘standard model’ of the natural numbers in a
                nonstandard set theory can be essentially the same as a
                *nonstandard* model of the natural numbers in some
                ‘standard’ set theory.

                So while I’m not an expert on this stuff, I have the
                feeling that going to second-order logic merely ‘sweeps
                the problem under the rug’.

    Fascinating post! That last bit, about different models of real
    numbers giving rise to the same complex numbers, reminds me a bit of
    Turing universality—how different models of computation that appear
    very different all give rise to the same set of computable
    functions. I can see why people might think that
    ![\\mathbb{C}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{C}")
    is in some sense “more fundamental” than
    ![\\mathbb{R}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{R}")—which
    might tie into why complex numbers appear at the heart of physics.

        Indeed, my latest burst of interest in logic came from some
        papers arguing that the “logical perfection” of the complex
        numbers might explain their appearance in physics:

        • Boris Zilber, [Perfect infinities and finite
        approximation](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/zilber/inf-to-finite.pdf).

        • Boris Zilber, [On model theory, noncommutative geometry and
        physics](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/zilber/bul-survey.pdf).

        I explained the basic ideas over at the *n*-Category Café, and
        in the comments some people gave good criticisms:

        • John Baez, [Uncountably categorical
        theories](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/08/logically_perfect_theories.html).

        I think these criticisms would need to be dealt with to make
        further progress. Briefly, while the ‘purely algebraic’ approach
        to the complex numbers gives an uncountably categorical theory,
        this approach doesn’t include complex conjugation or the
        topology on the complex numbers, both of which are crucial in
        quantum physics as we know it.

        The post here is kind of a slowed-down, expanded version of the
        easy part of my post on the *n*-Café.

    I don’t have anything constructive to add to this fantastic post
    except to point out a very minor typo:

    “And in second-order logic can write down a theory of real numbers
    that’s categorical!”: add a “we” between “logic” and “can”?

    In the definition of arithmetical real numbers, I think the
    ![a](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a")
    should be an

    or vice versa.

    I’m a bit surprised that it’s an open question whether or not
    ![\\pi-e](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi-e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi-e")
    is irrational! Given how simple some of the proofs are for the

    and
    ![e](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "e")
    individually, I wonder if it would actually be very difficult to
    prove, or whether people have just decided that it’s not a very
    interesting question.

    Yes, I’ll fix that. I’m in the mood for
    ![x.](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x.&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x.")

    Actually, now that I look, I see people saying that nobody knows if
    ![\\pi +
    e](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%2B+e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi + e")
    is irrational. This seems to be an independent question (though I’ve
    only thought about it for one minute, so I could be missing an easy
    trick). But I think if people knew the answer for ![\\pi -
    e,](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+-+e%2C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi - e,")
    I would have heard.

    Here’s a fun puzzle: show that at least one of ![\\pi -
    e](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+-+e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi - e")
    and ![e
    \\pi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e+%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "e \pi")
    must be irrational. There’s a one-line proof, not using anything
    very fancy.

    Given that the irrationality of
    ![e](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "e")
    and ![e +
    1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e+%2B+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "e + 1")
    are individually quite easy to prove, you might think *their*
    difference would be easy to prove irrational too.

    > …or whether people have just decided that it’s not a very

    I think mathematicians would consider this hugely interesting. But I
    don’t know how hard people have tried to prove this particular fact.
    People have though much harder about Schanuel’s conjecture, which
    would settle this and a vast number of similar questions:

    **[Schanuel’s
    conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schanuel%27s_conjecture).**
    Given any complex numbers
    ![z\_1,...,z\_n](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_1%2C...%2Cz_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "z_1,...,z_n")
    that are linearly independent over the rational numbers
    ![\\mathbb{Q}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BQ%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{Q}"),
    the field

    ![\\mathbb{Q}(z\_1,...,z\_n,
    \\exp(z\_1),...,\\exp(z\_n))](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BQ%7D%28z_1%2C...%2Cz_n%2C+%5Cexp%28z_1%29%2C...%2C%5Cexp%28z_n%29%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{Q}(z_1,...,z_n, \exp(z_1),...,\exp(z_n))")

    has transcendence degree at least $n$ over
    ![\\mathbb{Q}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BQ%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{Q}").

    Here
    ![\\mathbb{Q}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BQ%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{Q}")
    is the field of rational numbers, and the [**transcendence
    degree**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_degree) of a
    field
    ![L](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "L")
    over a field
    ![K](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "K")
    is the cardinality of the largest set of elements of
    ![L](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "L")
    that obey no polynomial equations with coefficients in
    ![K](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "K").

    So, if Schanuel’s conjecture is true,

    ![\\mathbb{Q}(1, i \\pi, e\^1,e\^{i\\pi}) = \\mathbb{Q}(e,
    \\pi)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BQ%7D%281%2C+i+%5Cpi%2C+e%5E1%2Ce%5E%7Bi%5Cpi%7D%29+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BQ%7D%28e%2C+%5Cpi%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbb{Q}(1, i \pi, e^1,e^{i\pi}) = \mathbb{Q}(e, \pi)")

    has transcendence degree 2, so
    ![e](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "e")
    and
    ![\\pi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi")
    don’t obey any nontrivial polynomial equations with rational
    coefficients.

    And as Richard Elwes once pointed out to me, the logician Boris
    Zilber has proved a truly astounding fact about Schanuel’s
    conjecture, using ideas about uncountably categorical theories.

    An **exponential field** is field with an operation
    ![\\exp](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\exp")
    obeying these rules:

    ![\\exp(a + b) = \\exp(a) \\exp(b) , \\quad \\exp(0) =
    1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp%28a+%2B+b%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28a%29+%5Cexp%28b%29+%2C+%5Cquad+%5Cexp%280%29+%3D+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\exp(a + b) = \exp(a) \exp(b) , \quad \exp(0) = 1")

    Zilber showed that up to isomorphism, there is a unique exponential
    field that obeys Schanuel’s conjecture and has the ordinary complex
    numbers as its underlying field!

    So either the complex numbers with its usual notion of
    exponentiation obeys Schanuel’s conjecture, or there is *another*
    operation on the complex numbers, some sort of
    ‘pseudoexponentiation’, which obeys

    ![\\exp(a + b) = \\exp(a) \\exp(b) , \\quad \\exp(0) =
    1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp%28a+%2B+b%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28a%29+%5Cexp%28b%29+%2C+%5Cquad+%5Cexp%280%29+%3D+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\exp(a + b) = \exp(a) \exp(b) , \quad \exp(0) = 1")

    but is not related to the usual exponentiation!

    Right now this is a very interesting ‘rhetorical argument’ for
    Schanuel’s conjecture: either it’s true or something very weird
    would have to be true. Maybe someday it will be part of a full
    proof.

    Lots of interesting things to ponder! But at least the puzzle wasn’t
    too hard. Suppose
    ![\\pi-e](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi-e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi-e")
    and ![e
    \\pi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e+%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "e \pi")
    were **both** rational. Then the quadratic:

    ![q(x) = x\^2 - (\\pi-e) x - e
    \\pi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%28x%29+%3D+x%5E2+-+%28%5Cpi-e%29+x+-+e+%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "q(x) = x^2 - (\pi-e) x - e \pi")

    has rational coefficients. But:

    ![q(\\pi) = \\pi\^2 - (\\pi-e)\\pi - e \\pi
    =0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%28%5Cpi%29+%3D+%5Cpi%5E2+-+%28%5Cpi-e%29%5Cpi+-+e+%5Cpi+%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "q(\pi) = \pi^2 - (\pi-e)\pi - e \pi =0")

    which contradicts the known fact that
    ![\\pi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi")
    is transcendental.

        Greg, unless I’m missing something your final equation doesn’t
        contradict pi being transcendental – it can’t possibly, because
        it’s a true statement (in fact, it’s true when pi and e are
        replaced w/ any real numbers).

            I see, the contradiction is not in the final equation alone,
            but rather in that entire line and the one above.

            The contradiction is that if ![\\pi -
            e](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+-+e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi - e")

            ![e\\pi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "e\pi")
            are both rational, then
            ![\\pi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi")
            and
            ![e](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "e")
            are roots of a polynomial with rational coefficients—which
            is impossible, since they’re transcendental numbers.

            We can use the same type of argument to show that ![\\pi +
            e](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%2B+e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\pi + e")
            and ![e
            \\pi](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e+%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "e \pi")
            can’t both be rational.

            While we’re talking about easy, fun proofs, here’s a
            classic:

            Show that there are irrational numbers
            ![a,b](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Cb&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a,b")
            such that
            ![a\^b](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5Eb&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a^b")
            is rational.

            Okay, consider
            ![\\sqrt{2}\^{\\sqrt{2}}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%5E%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}").
            It could be rational, in which case we’re done. So suppose
            it’s irrational. Then note that

            ![\\displaystyle{
            \\left(\\sqrt{2}\^{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\^{\\sqrt{2}} } =
            2](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cleft%28%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%5E%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D+%7D+%3D+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\displaystyle{ \left(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{\sqrt{2}} } = 2")

            so we’re done.

            [In
            fact](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/446647/irrationality-of-sqrt2-sqrt2),
            Kuzmin showed in 1930 that for any natural numbers
            ![m,n](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%2Cn&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "m,n")
            with ![m \\ne
            0,1](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%5Cne+0%2C1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "m \ne 0,1")
            and
            ![n](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n")
            not a perfect square,
            ![m\^{\\sqrt{n}}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%5E%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "m^{\sqrt{n}}")
            is transcendental. Hence
            ![2\^{\\sqrt{2}}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "2^{\sqrt{2}}")
            is transcendental and thus so is its square root
            ![\\sqrt{2}\^{\\sqrt{2}}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%5E%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}").
            This shows the difference between what you can get from
            cheap tricks and what you can get from real work.

                Here’s an easy and non-cheap solution to that last
                puzzle:
                ![\\sqrt{2}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\sqrt{2}")
                is irrational, and ![2\\frac{\\log 3}{\\log
                2}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Cfrac%7B%5Clog+3%7D%7B%5Clog+2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "2\frac{\log 3}{\log 2}")
                is also irrational (for if ![\\frac{\\log 3}{\\log 2} =
                \\frac{p}{q}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Clog+3%7D%7B%5Clog+2%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7Bq%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\frac{\log 3}{\log 2} = \frac{p}{q}")
                where ![p,
                q](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2C+q&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "p, q")
                are integers, then ![2\^{p/q} =
                3](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bp%2Fq%7D+%3D+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "2^{p/q} = 3")
                and therefore ![2\^p =
                3\^q](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Ep+%3D+3%5Eq&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "2^p = 3^q"),
                contradicting the fundamental theorem of arithmetic).
                Thus ![a =
                \\sqrt{2}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a = \sqrt{2}")
                and ![b = 2\\frac{\\log 3}{\\log
                2}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b+%3D+2%5Cfrac%7B%5Clog+3%7D%7B%5Clog+2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "b = 2\frac{\log 3}{\log 2}")
                are irrational, but we have ![a\^b =
                3](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5Eb+%3D+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a^b = 3").

    I feel like you left out the final statement. Turn around the
    statement that you actually ended with (before the references); you
    can start with an uncountable algebraically closed field of
    characteristic zero (which could be the standard field of complex
    numbers) and find within it many non-isomorphic but elementarily
    equivalent subfields of ‘real’ numbers (one of which could be the
    standard field of real numbers). Or to put it another way, you can
    find many non-isomorphic but elementarily equivalent
    complex-conjugation operations (technically: ring involutions) on
    the field.

        Good point! Over the *n*-Category Café, [Mike
        Shulman](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/08/logically_perfect_theories.html#c047228)
        said it a bit differently, and quite nicely:

        > Put differently, the complex numbers contain more than one
        > non-isomorphic real-closed field that together with
        > ![i](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "i")
        > generate all of it.

        By the way, this is precise:

        > you can find many non-isomorphic but elementarily equivalent
        > complex-conjugation operations (technically: ring involutions)
        > on the field.

        but this is a bit vague:

        > you can start with an uncountable algebraically closed field
        > of characteristic zero (which could be the standard field of
        > complex numbers) and find within it many non-isomorphic but
        > elementarily equivalent subfields of ‘real’ numbers

        until you say what ‘real’ means here. You probably mean more
        than ‘real closed fields’, since the standard reals probably
        contain within them some uncountable proper real closed
        subfields (though to be frank I didn’t give any examples and I
        can’t instantly think of any). You probably meant what you
        hinted at next: uncountable real closed fields that are fixed by
        some involution of the complex numbers. Or else what Mike said.

    Bit late to the party, but…

    You write

    > So in fact, a categorical theory only gives a full description of
    > the mathematical structure it’s talking about relative to a choice
    > of what sets are like.

    This is reflected in category theoretic approaches to sets in that
    the natural number object in a topos is unique up to isomorphism
    (and uniquely so, if we ask this to preserve the structure). But
    postulating the existence of a topos with nno that is also
    well-pointed and satisfies Choice (i.e. ETCS) we can build other
    toposes satisfying those conditions, which *aren’t* equivalent to
    the first, they have their own nno and arithmetic statements that
    may be false in one may be true in another.

    From the point of view of a material set theorist who thinks in
    terms of some vaguely Platonic universe of sets, then perhaps one
    feels there should be a ‘real’ set of natural numbers. But category
    theoretically, the thinking is more synthetic. I at least have no
    problems thinking about different toposes having completely
    different natural number objects – it would be surprising if they
    were ‘the same’!

-   How To Write Math Here:
    -----------------------

    You can [include math in your comments using
    LaTeX](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics), but you need
    to do it this way:

    $latex E = mc\^2$

    You need the word 'latex' right after the first dollar sign, and it
    needs a space after it. Double dollar signs don't work, and other
    limitations apply, some described
    [here](http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/). You can't preview
    comments here, but I'm happy to fix errors.
