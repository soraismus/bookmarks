Recently I was asked to give a talk about working in the IT industry for
the first year students. I was asked to represent our company (Saga) at
technical level and after intensive thinking about the subject for
presentation I came up with six tips for faster advancement in IT
industry.

Those tips would have helped me a lot if I’ve heard them in the
beginning of my career. I’ve been working in IT industry for about five
years on a few enterprise-scale applications and I’ve advanced for that
period from junior programmer to Solution Architect. So having that in
mind I felt competent to give a few tips:

### Choose company which will help you grow

You should choose your employer really carefully, especially at the
beginning of your career. You’ll want an employer that will help you
grow, improve your skills and gain valuable experience.

You should set a long-term goal. Something you want to achieve in the
future and keep that goal in your mind at all times. Every job should
set you closer for reaching that goal. And when you finally reach it you
will feel a lot better about yourself, you will know that you earned it
and that you are capable of defining your own future.

Your employer should challenge you with the size and creativity of
projects. He should help you improve your skills and gain new skills
relevant to your long-term goal.

### Find a mentor

When you start working at new job you will want to learn your job as
quickly as possible. It will be much easier if there is someone to teach
you, someone who is already good at it. When you start working at new
company your new employer should provide a mentor for you, but if that
is not the case you must find it on your own.

I suggest that you ask the most experienced colleague to be your mentor.
Explain to him that you want to improve your skills and get into the job
as quickly as possible, and that you find him the best example of what
you want to accomplish. Using this approach you will acknowledge him as
an expert in the area and as someone you professionally admire, so
hopefully he will accept to be your mentor.

### Stay on top of things

IT industry is very dynamic. We can see new products and technologies
come out on a daily basis, so if you want to be very good at your job
you must “stay on top of things”. In other words you must learn new
stuff continually.

One good way to stay informed is to follow the most influential people
in your area. You can do this on social networks or simply by
subscribing to RSS feeds for most relevant blogs.

I can recommend Google Reader for that purpose. If you don’t know where
to start simply open Google Reader, click on link “Browse for stuff” and
select a few bundles most relevant to your field. Bundles are
collections of quality blogs for various fields that Google selected for
us.

Once you make checking for new things your usual practice you will
notice how you know everything what happens at your field. When new
library comes out, when the library you use gets updated, when the
interesting job position opens and so on.

### Write a blog

Absolutely every software developer should have a blog.

I saw this interesting remark on [Scott Hanselman’s
blog](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) and I couldn’t agree more. Here is
my list of the best things about blogging:

-   To write about subject you must really understand it. Well you
    don’t, but if you want people to understand what you want to say
    then you must. If you only partially understand a subject and you
    start to write about it you will soon enough find out that you can’t
    complete a few sentences.
-   Don’t forget about big problems you solved. When you find a
    challenging task and you successfully complete it write it down.
    Later at some point you may need to remember solution, or simply you
    can watch back and see what decisions you made and how much you
    improved over time.
-   How do you find solutions for your problems? Think about it, how
    many times you found a solution to your problem at someones blog? I
    know I did a lot, especially for some tricky problems, problems that
    require elaboration. So, write down solution for a tricky problem,
    chances are someone will have the same problem as you do. In that
    way you will repay your debt to community which helped you and you
    will feel a lot better, I promise.
-   Blog is very good addition to your CV. Did you ever ask yourself
    what will your potential employer see if he enters your name in
    search engine? Facebook profile with some compromising pictures?
    Tweets when you were in a bad mood? Why not showcase your rock solid
    problem solving skill? By looking at your blog your potential
    employer will see all kinds of problems you solved over time and he
    will get to know you really good from professional aspect.

### Work on personal projects

Always attempt to stretch your limits. To do that you must attempt
something that is not your usual field of work, something creative. How
about creating a game? Something old and simple and yet challenging
(tetris, minesweeper, battleships, sudoku). Or you might start working
on some opensource project. In the end you will have a good time and
learn a lot from it.

### Organize your time

Essentially a measure of your success at work will be how many things
you get done. You can be a great expert at some field, but if you don’t
know how to organize your time effectively you may not get the
recognition you deserve.

Here is a list of a few good tips I came across over time:

-   Don’t read your email in the morning. If you do you might
    time-travel to afternoon. Chances are you will find some emails you
    must answer, or you might engage a discussion over email.
-   Find your most productive time period in a day and use it to the
    maximum. For example I found out that I’m the most productive from
    9:00-12:00. So I try to put all important things in that period and
    less important things (mail reading, surfing) afterwards. This is
    simply a good strategy to get the most out of your time.
-   Don’t get burned! In your free time try not to look at the screen,
    try to relax and spend some time with your friends and family. You
    will feel a lot better and fresh after some quality time.

So that’s it. That was the list of tips that helped me a lot throughout
my career so far. Try them and see how it goes, they might work for you
better then you think.

What do you think? Would you add some tips to this list?
