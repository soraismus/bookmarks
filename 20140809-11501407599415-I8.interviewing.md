IN “ZERO TO ONE”*,*Peter Thiel's forthcoming guide to startups, he lets
aspiring tech magnates in on an effective if unorthodox rule for making
smart decisions: don’t do business with anyone who dresses in a suit. A
slicked-up entrepreneur is inevitably a salesman trying to compensate
for an inferior product. Based on this perception, Mr Thiel’s venture
fund instituted a blanket rule to pass on any company whose principals
dressed in formal wear for pitch meetings. The evidence suggests that
Thiel’s bias worked: the fund was an early investor in companies like
Napster, Facebook and Spotify. “Maybe we still would have avoided these
bad investments if we had taken the time to evaluate each company’s
technology in detail,” he writes. “But the team insight—never invest in
a tech CEO that wears a suit—got us to the truth a lot faster.”

In Silicon Valley informality has long been *de rigueur*. But as the
startup bug is spreading to innovation hubs across the world, hoodies,
T-shirts and sneakers are the new corporate livery. The shift isn’t just
a matter of comfort or convenience, but a change in how we conceptualise
competence and professionalism. The thinking goes something like this:
by stripping away the artificial appearances of showmanship, you can get
to the truth about a product, person, or business. It is part of a
cultural gravitation toward transparency—and a penchant for disruption
in all its forms. People who have the confidence to dress informally and
to disrupt traditional business codes, are perceived as more
independent, innovative and competent.

Researchers at Harvard Business School call this the “red sneakers
effect”. In a study published by *The Journal of Consumer Research*they
note that professors dressed less formally at academic events as they
gained higher status. Students also perceived unshaven, devil-may-care
professors as more knowledgeable than ones in a dress shirt and tie.
These mildly rebellious signals are powerful in a culture that has long
emphasised conformity as the road to social acceptance. “Instead of
showing you can afford to spend money,” the authors explain, “you’re
showing you can afford to spend your social capital… You’re saying, I’m
so autonomous and successful that I can afford to dress in a
non-conforming way.”

The way we signal status has also changed. Especially in business,
success isn’t just about looking wealthy, but about looking different. A
lot rides on the perspective of the viewer. Not everyone will look
favorably on red sneakers in a professional setting. At a recent
business-school symposium at which a professor wore red converse
sneakers, executives who also owned a pair of eccentric shoes granted
the professor higher professional status than those who didn’t.

People who value disruption and unconventionality are more likely to
interpret these signals positively. They work where deviations from the
norm are lauded, and the interpretation says as much about the viewer as
the wearer. But as waves of hoodie-wearing 20-somethings flood
companies, sartorial deviation is poised to become the new norm. When
everyone wears a T-shirt to lectures and board meetings, how do you tell
who is truly innovative and who is just posing?

At the end of the day, the trend toward informality doesn’t actually get
away from the traditional business emphasis on appearance and
presentation. It just replaces one standard with another that is, in its
own way, just as obsessed with appearance. Still, insofar as this new
bias emphasises—at least for some time—originality, independence, and
substance over style, it serves a purpose, as Mr Thiel's anecdote
highlights. The irony is that it still has to go through style to get
there.

I'm not so successful that I can get away with hoodies and t-shirts,
yet. For now I go with floral themed, short sleeved, button down,
collared shirts; AKA Hawaiian shirts. They're comfortable, a little
different, technically but only just business casual as mandated by the
office dress code, and the CEO wears them too (when not in a suit) which
isn't a bad thing. But don't all you hipsters start wearing them now; I
don't want to have to think of something new to wear.

The article is about a decade or two behind the times. We've come full
circle, in my experience at least. I find that eccentric dressing has
become an end in itself and the people who do dress in red sneakers and
baggy chinos and unwashed jeans are the ones who are substituting
showmanship for competence.\
 There are those who buy fluorescent messenger bags because they are
intrinsically non-conformist and truly like the bags and there are those
who buy the bag only to send the message that they're non-conformist but
aren't really so. There are those whose shirts are wrinkled because they
have better things to do than get them laundered and there are those for
whom wrinkled shirts are a carefully thought out and cultivated look.

You know, that might have been the worst (or best? author, was this
intentional?) selected stock photo for this article. Figure that women
have been discriminated against in business and tech for years and have
used suits -- yup, simply wearing a suit -- to garner some respect and
maybe delay hitting the glass ceiling. The article says one thing,
literally, but that image says another entirely.

Seems a bit cynical to view proper business attire as anything other
than a simple sign of respect for your colleagues/customers, along the
lines of other common courtesies like a proper handshake, eye contact,
not putting your feet on the conference room table. Is it ok to smile,
or is that compensating for an inferior product?

The fact that you associate anything other than business attire to being
a bum says volumes about you. None of it good by the way. It should not
matter how someone dresses if they have a solid product or can do
top-level work. This old school mentality is thankfully dying with the
older generations.

Well, it depends one where you are looking. In the corporate world in
which I work in Western Canada, the trend is in the exact opposite
direction. The younger employees are dressing much better than the
previous generation of employees. Management seems to be still wearing
golf shirts and Dockers, whereas the grunts are wearing dress pants and
collared shirts.

Eons ago, Desmond Morris, the human species zoologist, noted that the
informal dress code of one generation becomes the formal one for the
next.

Probably true now, but I don't think it was always true. I worked for a
very innovative (and very profitable) electronics company in the
eighties and nineties. We were mocked by others because we were the last
company whose engineers donned suits for exhibition stands and product
launches. The time we finally abandoned this and went company-casual was
almost exactly the time we lost the spark which had kept us in the lead,
and we became just another tech company in the late nineties.

Informality is anything but a dressing code. It should reflect an
individual's personality and self-confidence, traits prevailing upon
common standards and corporate identity rules (all too often concerned
with the staff's appearance). But such an attitude loses these traits
when it gets "cool".

This trend in dressing down in Silicon Valley has a lot to do with Steve
Jobs: the original computer nerd genius.\
 Apple Computer's success was more due to luck than competency.\
 Apple was Stephen Jobs.\
 And Stephen Jobs was crazy.\
 Jobs was bipolar.\
 And they can be visionary, inspirational and charismatic.\
 Any other personality would not have have achieved their string of
success of great products.\
 And become the most valued company in America and became the leader of
the computer industry, the music industry, the smart phone industry, the
gadget industry, and now tablet computing.\
 Now the most valued company in America and most profitable in the
world.\
 -\
 Jobs is Insanely Great.\
 Both Insane and Great.\
 The problem with the button-up corporates are they are NOT crazy. They
just push elevator buttons until they get to their floor.\
 Jobs was a vegetarian and lived with Buddhist simplicity--certainly not
like a billionaire.\
 He dressed like an impoverished college student and never had jewelry
or bling.\
 He had priorities focused like a laser.\
 Jobs had a terminal cancer and a liver transplant...how many CEO's
could have run their company in that state, let alone pull off one of
the greatest corporate turnarounds in modern business history?\
 And towards the end spent his last months suffering in service and
enduring life. And going to work.\
 For these new start up pretenders, is a kiddie dress up game, not a
sign of mad scientist genius of the generation.\
 ===\
 Hoodies and sneakers are simply the new business suit.\
 You can't engineer craziness.\
 Don't mix up fashion for genius or competency.

I am one of the few people in my office that wears a suit to work
(because I like the simplicity of it and I think they are comfortable
and look nice). I just wonder if I'm the conformist or non-conformist in
my company?

The “red sneakers effect” is similar to how female corporate executives
are more likely to wear fishnet stockings to work than their admin
assistants.

A sign of astuteness in business is to adjust your approach to fit the
people you are trying to persuade. Every good salesman knows that.

Still, Thiel's Law sounds like a way to relieve himself of thought.

*The evidence suggests that Thiel’s bias worked: the fund was an early
investor in companies like Napster, Facebook and Spotify.*

Which Napster?\
 The first launch, or the 2nd one - after the 1st got into legal
trouble.\
 --

"Spotify has lost a total of $200 million since it was founded,
according to a report last year based on its financial disclosures
written by PrivCo, a firm that studies private company performance.
Spotify declined to discuss its balance sheet."\
