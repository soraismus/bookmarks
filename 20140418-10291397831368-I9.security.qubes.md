*This was originally published on the [Freedom of the Press Foundation’s
blog](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/04/operating-system-can-protect-you-even-if-you-get-hacked).*

We wrote about the importance of the [Tails operating
system](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/04/help-support-little-known-privacy-tool-has-been-critical-journalists-reporting-nsa)
to all of the NSA journalists last week, but there’s also another
little-known operating system that journalists should consider using if
they find themselves in high-risk scenarios. It’s called
[Qubes](http://qubes-os.org/).

I’ve only been using Qubes for a few weeks, but I feel like my operating
system is now a digital fortress. Let me try to explain why, and how
Qubes differs from Tails.

Qubes’ design is based off an important law of software: all programs
contain bugs. Some of these are security vulnerabilities. Your computer
can get hacked by viewing a Flash video or using javascript in your web
browser: this is likely how NSA’s QUANTUM/FOXACID programs hack people.
Your computer could also get hacked by opening a PDF, or a Microsoft
Word or LibreOffice document, or just by viewing a JPG or GIF.

If any piece of software gets compromised, your whole computer is
compromised. The attacker can look at your files, log your keystrokes,
take screenshots, steal your encryption keys, and read the emails that
you type before you even have a chance to encrypt them.

Developers can (and should) try to make their software more secure, but
software will never be perfect. Trying to not get hacked is difficult
when you have powerful adversaries, yet still have to get work done.
Short of never connecting your computer to the internet, the best way to
stay secure is to minimize the damage caused when you do eventually get
hacked and “sandbox” the most vulnerable programs away from the rest of
your computer. Qubes makes this more straight-forward than any other
operating system I’ve used.

Qubes uses virtual machines to let you manage separate “security
domains”. A virtual machine (VM) is basically a tiny operating system
running inside of your real operating system. If your VM gets hacked,
the attacker is able to access the files and read keystrokes in that VM,
but not in other VMs or on your host computer. In Qubes all software
(besides the desktop environment) is running inside of VMs, and you can
easily and efficiently make as many as you need for whatever purposes
you need. It’s also designed in such a way that if one VM gets infected
with malware, the malware won’t be there the next time you reboot that
VM.

For example, you may want to use Pidgin, an instant messaging
application with [OTR
encryption](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/encryption-works#otr)
capability, to chat with people securely. But Pidgin is notorious for
its memory corruption vulnerabilities: the kind of bug that attackers
can use to take over your computer by IMing you a weird-looking message.
(All publicly known Pidgin vulnerabilities have been fixed if you’re
using the latest version, but there’s always the possibility that there
are vulnerabilities that have never been reported to the developers.
These are called zero day vulnerabilities, and agencies like NSA and FBI
spend lots of money to buy information about them.)

In order to use Pidgin as safely as possible, you can create an AppVM
(the Qubes word for a VM to run specific apps in) that you use only for
Pidgin. If a Pidgin-zero-day-wielding attacker sends you a weird-looking
message that takes over your computer, all it will actually take over is
your Pidgin AppVM. The worst that the attacker can do is steal your OTR
keys and spy on your chat conversations. Everything else on your
computer, such as your work documents, your PGP key, and your password
database, will remain safe from the attacker.

Another example that would be useful to journalists: if you’re writing
an article about sensitive documents, you can create an “air-gapped”
AppVM that contains these documents, and any files or drafts associated
with the story. If you open a document in this AppVM that tries to phone
home to alert someone that it’s been opened, it will fail because this
AppVM doesn’t have internet access. And if you open a malicious document
that hacks this AppVM, the malware won’t be able to exfiltrate any of
your files because it won’t have internet access. And finally, if some
other part of your computers gets compromised, like your web browser,
the attackers won’t have access to these sensitive work files.

You can also easily use “disposable VMs”, AppVMs that you create for a
specific purpose and delete when you’re done with them, to open
documents that you don’t completely trust. If that PDF someone emailed
you is actually malicious and tries to take over your computer, it will
only take over the disposable VM. But if it actually contains something
useful, you’ll still be able to read it.

You can do this all on one computer using a single desktop manager. This
is one of the most powerful features about Qubes.

You can always choose to isolate software like this on traditional
operating systems using tools like VirtualBox or VMWare, but it’s
impossible to do as good a job of locking down your computer as you can
with Qubes.

**Current state of the project**

At the moment you have to be pretty tech savvy in order to get the full
benefits of Qubes. And it doesn’t hurt if you’re already a Linux nerd. I
think this can be improved, but Qubes will never be a “turn on and
forget” security tool. Which security domains each user needs is
completely dependent on their preferences and security needs. But if you
understand your needs and understand how to use and configure AppVMs to
fit them, you’ll be able to use your computer with much higher security
than if you were using a traditional OS.

The places where usability could be greatly improved is hardware support
inside of VMs. I spent hours trying to figure out how to make my
laptop’s internal webcam accessible to an AppVM. The solution finally
ended up being to give the AppVM control of my USB controller and to
change permissions on /dev/video0 to be world-writable inside of the
AppVM — at the expense of having access to one my USB ports, and while
opening up other USB-related security problems (which normal OSes always
have). Hardware issues like this keep popping up for me: USB sticks work
fine, but USB ethernet cards don’t; I can’t easily import photos from my
Android phone. I have enough patience, googlefu, and Linux experience to
solve them, but I think many users would be lost.

**Qubes vs Tails?**

Qubes and Tails have fundamentally different use-cases. They’re both
very important, and I use both operating systems every day.

Tails is for staying anonymous. When you use it on a computer, it
doesn’t leave a trace that it was ever booted. It changes your MAC
address before you connect to a network, and it forces all traffic to go
over the Tor network, ensuring that you don’t make a technical mistake
and accidentally leak your IP address. When you use the web browser that
comes with Tails, your traffic looks exactly like the traffic of all
other Tor users.

Qubes is for staying secure while still being able to use a wide variety
of software that might contain zero day vulnerabilities, but it’s not
for staying anonymous. Qubes supports cool networking tricks, like
making an AppVM where all traffic is forced to go through Tor, but this
doesn’t incorporate most of the anonymity tricks that Tails excels at.

**Bottom line**

For maximum security, I would recommend that people use Qubes on their
computer for all their everyday, non-anonymous needs: checking email,
chatting, using social media and browsing the web, developing software,
doing research, writing articles. Since you do all of this work in
AppVMs that run Linux (and optionally some of it in AppVMs that run
Windows), you get the latest and best tools to work with, and it’s
simple to install new software. For more sensitive needs where anonymity
is important, you can use Tor Browser Bundle inside of an AppVM.

And for the most sensitive needs, as the NSA journalists explained, you
should boot to Tails.

[Ubuntu is finally taking privacy seriously](https://micahflee.com/2014/04/ubuntu-is-finally-taking-privacy-seriously/)
=======================================================================================================================

**Update: A couple people have pointed out that the privacy changes
won’t actually take affect in 14.04, which means that
[fixubuntu.com](https://fixubuntu.com/) will still be necessary until at
least 14.10, which will be released in October. Oops.**

In October 2012, Canonical made a horrible mistake. They included a
“feature” in Ubuntu 12.10 that has been widely considered
[adware](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/ubuntu-spyware-what-to-do) and
[spyware](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1070111). I blogged
about the new Ubuntu’s [Amazon ads and data
leaks](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/privacy-ubuntu-1210-amazon-ads-and-data-leaks)
for EFF at the time, with the main ask being that Dash’s online search
should be an opt-in feature and not enabled by default.

Ubuntu’s disregard for user privacy become the impetus that caused me to
[switch to
Debian](https://micahflee.com/2013/01/why-im-leaving-ubuntu-for-debian/)
(though nowadays I’m running [Qubes](http://qubes-os.org/trac)). And in
order to make it easier to fix Ubuntu’s privacy problems on new
computers I helped people set up, I started the website [Fix
Ubuntu](https://fixubuntu.com/).

Canonical, the company that makes Ubuntu, sent me a bogus [takedown
notice](https://micahflee.com/2013/11/canonical-shouldnt-abuse-trademark-law-to-silence-critics-of-its-privacy-decisions/)
about it—later apologizing for it. While it made the privacy issue
[blow](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/canonical-abused-trademark-law-to-target-a-site-critical-of-ubuntu-privacy/)
[up](http://www.wired.com/2013/11/fixubuntu/)
[in](http://news.slashdot.org/story/13/11/08/1335231/canonical-targets-ubuntu-privacy-critic)
[the](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1q5ba8/canonical_abused_trademark_law_to_target_a_site/)
[media](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131107/17583725174/disappointing-to-see-canonical-act-like-trademark-bully-over-ubuntu.shtml)
again, Canonical still refused to fix their bad privacy choices.

[![fixubuntu.com Streisand
effect](https://micahflee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/fixubuntu_streisand.png)](https://twitter.com/micahflee/status/399321587943342080)

So after all of this, I’m thrilled to see that Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, which
is due for release later this month, [won’t include online searches in
Dash by
default](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/03/ubuntu-make-amazon-product-results-opt-unity)!
For the first time in a year and a half of releases, a default
installation of Ubuntu won’t be phoning home with everything you type
into Dash, or annoying you with unsolicited ads.

**Thank you, Canonical, for finally taking privacy seriously.**

(While I’m at it: Thank you, Edward Snowden, for making everyone finally
start to take privacy seriously.)

[Two really simple things Microsoft can do to make Windows more secure against NSA](https://micahflee.com/2013/12/two-really-simple-things-microsoft-can-do-to-make-windows-more-secure-against-nsa/)

Thanks to Edward Snowden and journalists at Der Spiegel, today we
learned about [Tailored Access
Operations](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-nsa-uses-powerful-toolbox-in-effort-to-spy-on-global-networks-a-940969.html)
(TAO), NSA’s world-class hacking team. There was a lot of interesting
information in that article (like how they divert shipping of
electronics to a secret warehouse where they can modify it to install
backdoors!).

But I’m just going to talk about how they use Microsoft error reports to
gather private information about Windows computers that can be used to
compromise their security — a problem that’s trivially easy for
Microsoft to fix.

You know how Windows programs crash all the time? In order to make that
happen less, Microsoft collects information about the crash. They want
to know what program crashed and what the current state of your computer
is so that they can uncover the bug that you triggered and hopefully fix
it in a future update. You can read more about exactly what data gets
collected and how Microsoft “protects” this data by reading their
[Microsoft Error Reporting Service privacy
policy](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows/microsoft-error-reporting-privacy-statement).

![Windows error
reporting](https://micahflee.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/windows_error.png)

Because Microsoft doesn’t use freely available and widely used security
and privacy technology, these error reports can be used against Windows
users. From the [Spiegel
article](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-nsa-uses-powerful-toolbox-in-effort-to-spy-on-global-networks-a-940969-2.html):

So how could Microsoft easily prevent this from happening? They can do
these two things:

**Use HTTPS!**

There’s no reason why any piece of software that needs to communicate
back to its company’s servers shouldn’t use HTTPS instead of HTTP. It’s
not hard to set up or maintain, it’s not expensive, it scales really
well. It’s ridiculous that Mirosoft, the largest software company in the
world, still uses HTTP for anything.

If they were using HTTPS, NSA would have to compromise the SSL key or do
active man-in-the-middle attacks to get these error reports (and even
man-in-the-middle attacks could be prevented with certificate pinning).
However, just using HTTPS isn’t quite enough. Even if the error reports
are encrypted, NSA can still force Microsoft to hand over their error
report database.

**Use Tor!**

Windows, and every other operating system, should come with Tor
installed. When software wants to send “anonymous error reports,” or
“anonymous usage data to improve our service,” or anything else like
that, they should actually make it anonymous by proxying those requests
through the Tor network.

If Tor is installed, other software should use it to send anonymous data
back home too. Firefox and Chrome should send error reports and usage
data to Mozilla and Google over Tor instead of over the normal Internet.
Ubuntu’s Unity should send “anonymous” Dash search results to
productsearch.ubuntu.com over Tor, or else they can’t truly claim that
they’re anonymous.

These technologies are freely available, widely used, and open source.
It’s time that companies start acting like everything that happens on
the Internet is being spied on.

[How Mailpile can implement opportunistic PGP email encryption](https://micahflee.com/2013/12/how-i-want-mailpile-to-handle-openpgp/)
=====================================================================================================================================

[5
Replies](https://micahflee.com/2013/12/how-i-want-mailpile-to-handle-openpgp/#comments "Comment on How Mailpile can implement opportunistic PGP email encryption")

[![mailpile](https://micahflee.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mailpile.png)](http://www.mailpile.is/)For
those wanting to decentralize the Internet and encrypt all the things,
[Mailpile](http://www.mailpile.is/) is a hot topic.

**What’s Mailpile?**

Mailpile is a web-based email client (like Thunderbird or Outlook, not
to be confused with a service, like Gmail) that you install locally and
access by opening http://localhost:33411/ in your browser.

The goal of Mailpile is to give everyone all the nice features they’re
used to with Gmail but that you don’t get with a traditional email
client, like labels, conversations, and really quick search. You can use
Mailpile to check any email address (including your @gmail.com one).

Right now Gmail is overwhelmingly the most popular email provider
because it’s such a good product. If you want to escape Google’s
centralized one-stop-PRISM-shop email service you have to put up with
something that’s more annoying to use. Mailpile promises to make any
email service you want to use as usable as Gmail, with the added benefit
that Google-bots don’t parse the contents of your email and serve
targeted ads, and that you have a choice of who to host your email with
(perhaps you want to host it in Iceland, or on a home server).
Basically, it might help break Gmail’s deathgrip on the email market,
and considerably re-decentralize email.

But what the cypherpunks are most excited about is that Mailpile has the
potential to make PGP-encrypted email not suck nearly as much as it does
today.

*Note: Mailpile is an [open source
project](https://github.com/pagekite/mailpile) that’s been funded by a
successful Indiegogo campaign. Right now it’s in a pre-alpha state, so
it doesn’t work yet. The alpha is scheduled for release in January.*

**How will PGP be different in Mailpile?**

Everyone wants to use PGP email encryption in the Gmail web interface.
There have been plenty of attempts at building PGP browser add-ons
([Mailvelope](http://mailvelope.com/) seems to be the most promising
right now) but so far nothing has really stuck because of some
fundamental problems about glueing PGP onto a system that was never
designed for it.

Mailpile is being designed for it. When you open an encrypted email in
Mailpile the server detects that it’s encrypted and calls out to gpg to
decrypt it using gpg-agent. Your operating system pops up a passphrase
dialog, so your passphrase never goes through the browser. All OpenPGP
operations happen as system calls to gpg, the same way it works with
Enigmail. Additionally, since Mailpile will have access to all your
local email, it will be possible to do things such as search encrypted
email.

This is a chance to build the user interface for OpenPGP correctly and
to remove all of the friction from using it. In fact, I believe that
Mailpile could pretty effectively make PGP encrypted email encryption
happen almost in the background, without the user needing to do much of
anything.

**How can Mailpile make using PGP suck less?**

Mailpile should encourage a PGP trust system similar to how SSH trust
works, Trust-On-First-Use (TOFU). Since there’s a very small chance that
you’ll be the victim of an active man-in-the-middle attack the very
first time you see a public key, you can go ahead and assume that the
first key you saw is valid. With, of course, the ability to change this
trust setting manually for each key.

This proposal relies heavily on using key servers, and Mailpile should
communicate with key servers using Tor. Not using Tor would leak
information about who you are and who emails you. The Windows and Mac
versions will have a trickier time with a Tor dependency, but it’s
certainly possible and I think it’s absolutely worth it.

Everyone should have a PGP key. When you setup an account in Mailpile it
should help you create a PGP key if you don’t already have one. If you
create a new PGP key and already have old secret keys in your keyring,
it should offer to sign your new key with your old ones. Each time you
add a new Mailpile account it should offer to add a new user ID to your
primary key. Every time your key is changed it should upload your
modified key to key servers.

Mailpile should keep a local database of metadata about PGP keys. For
each public key it knows about it should record the timestamp from the
first time you saw it in your email. Each key should also have a trust
settings: either “trusted”, “not trusted”, or “automatic”, completely
separate from any data that’s stored in the actual PGP key packets (like
user trust or signatures).

Every time you see a PGP-signed email, if the user doesn’t already have
the PGP key that signed that email it should search key servers for it
and download it. When you add a new account it should also search all of
your old email for signatures and try downloading all of those public
keys from key servers, too.

All emails should default to being signed, and as many emails as
possible should be encrypted by default. When you write a new email and
put email addresses in the To, CC, and BCC fields, if you have “trusted”
PGP keys for all recipients, the email should default to being
encrypted.

The question is: what does “trusted” mean? Since we want to rely on TOFU
by default I think it should mean this:

-   If you have signed the key, it should be trusted.
-   If you have manually marked it as “trusted” in the Mailpile
    interface, it should be trusted.
-   If you have manually marked it as “untrusted” in the Mailpile
    interface, it should be untrusted.

If you haven’t signed it and you haven’t marked it as “trusted” or
“untrusted”, it should use this algorthim (or something similar) to make
an intelligent decision about whether this public key should be
trustworthy enough to encrypt the message to:

-   If this is the only key that includes a user ID with the recipient’s
    email address on, it should be trusted.
-   Elif all other keys that include a user ID with the recipient’s
    email address have signed this key, it should be trusted.
-   Elif this is the *first* key you’ve seen that includes a user ID
    with the recipient’s email address on it, it should be trusted.
-   Otherwise, it should be untrusted.

**What would this do?**

With these defaults, a couple things will happen. You’ll automatically
download the public keys of everyone else that you email that uses PGP.
When you write emails, they’ll get opportunistically encrypted. If a
bunch of different people who regularly email each other all use
Mailpile, they don’t have to change any behavior at all, and all their
email will automatically get encrypted.

If people try to attack this system by sending you emails that are
signed with malicious keys pretending to be other people, you won’t
trust those keys by default. You’ll still encrypt to the first key you
saw.

If someone creates a new PGP key for their email address and you still
have their old one, the first time you email them you’ll encrypt it to
the wrong key (unless they’ve been good PGP users and signed their new
key with their old one, in which case it will just work). However, you
should be able to quickly work out the problem and manually mark the new
key as “trusted”. From that point on it should just work.

You can use PGP completely safely, and have very high confidence that
most of the public keys you use are valid, without having to participate
in or even know what the Web of Trust is. If you do use the Web of
Trust, all the keys you sign would be trusted like you expect.

**So wait, does this exist?**

Nope, it’s just an idea. But I think it could work pretty well.

If other people agree that it’s a good idea, I’d love it if the Mailpile
developers decided to implement it as default behavior in Mailpile. If
not, I’d love it if at least someone could build a Mailpile plugin that
does this.

[Leaving EFF and joining a fearless team of journalists](https://micahflee.com/2013/11/leaving-eff-and-joining-a-fearless-team-of-journalists/)

[5

I started working at the [Electronic Frontier
Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) in March of 2011. I joined the tech
team as EFF’s first full-fledged web developer, eventually switching
jobs internally to become a staff technologist. After over two and a
half years of working with the most inspiring group of people I’ve ever
met, I’m moving on to join a startup. Monday is my last day of work at
EFF.

Pierre Omidyar, Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, Jeremy Scahill, and a
fantastic team of people are starting a media organization that will
[redefine
journalism](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/business/media/an-interview-with-pierre-omidyar.html),
and I’m joining its tech team. My focus will be on using technology to
ensure that the constitutional rights of journalists cannot be violated
by powerful spy agencies or anyone else.

I’m ecstatic about my change in career, and there are so many ideas
buzzing around my head about it. But I’ll wait until we launch our
website before talking about the new company. Instead I’m going to talk
about my time at EFF.

Some of the exciting things I was a part of at EFF included:

-   Migrating EFF away from an expensive, third-party, proprietary
    service (for sending email blasts, action alerts, and accepting
    donations) Convio into the open source, self-hosted software

I run the website [fixubuntu.com](https://fixubuntu.com/), a place to
quickly and easily learn how to disable the privacy-invasive features
that are enabled by default in Ubuntu.

This morning I received this email from an employee of Canonical

The first thing I would like to say is my use of the Ubuntu logo and the
word “ubuntu” in my domain name falls under [nominative
use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_use). Although I’m
perfectly within my rights to continue using both, I’ve decided to
remove the Ubuntu logo from the website, but add a disclaimer—because it
seems like a nice thing to do.

Canonical employees: If this still bothers you, there’s a simple thing
you can do to make me completely shut down the website. You can require
users to *opt-in* to you collecting information about what they’re
searching for on their own computers and then displaying ads to them
about it, rather than violating their privacy by default. If people
didn’t need to find websites that teach them how to opt out, there would
be no reason for me to run fixubuntu.com. It’s as simple as:

`gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Lenses remote-content-search none`

Sending a (very polite, which I appreciate) takedown request isn’t very
much in the spirit of open source. If you’d like to improve
fixubuntu.com in a more productive way, then I suggest you submit a
patch. The code for fixubuntu.com is licensed under the [GNU Affero

[HTML email, attachments, and flowed text in Enigmail](https://micahflee.com/2013/09/html-email-attachments-and-flowed-text-in-enigmail/)
=========================================================================================================================================

[3

I’ve noticed that a lot of people who are new to GPG really don’t want
to give up their HTML email, but the Enigmail setup wizard recommends
that you do this.

[![Enigmail Setup
Wizard](https://micahflee.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/enigmail_wizard1.png)](https://micahflee.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/enigmail_wizard1.png)

People have also had weird problems with email attachments when sending
signed or encrypted emails. And when you use Enigmail’s default settings
and compose your messages in plaintext, Enigmail also turns off “flowed
text”, so that lines get wrapped at 72 characters.

Well, none of this is actually a problem if you use PGP/MIME, which is
the recommended way of using OpenPGP anyway. You can safely compose
messages in HTML, there are no problems with attachments, and if you use
plaintext email it’s completely fine to use flowed text. Here’s how to
configure Thunderbird to work with PGP/MIME.

Go to Account Settings. In Windows and Linux this is in the Edit menu,
in Mac OS X this is in the Tools menu. Go to the OpenPGP Security page
(if you have multiple Thunderbird accounts you’ll need to do this for
each one).

[![Enabling
PGP/MIME](https://micahflee.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/enigmail_pgpmime.png)](https://micahflee.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/enigmail_pgpmime.png)

Make sure that “Use PGP/MIME by default” is checked. While you’re at it,
you might want to sign both non-encrypted and encrypted messages by
default.

Once you have enabled PGP/MIME, it’s completely safe to use HTML email,
attachments don’t have any problems, and it’s also safe to use flowed
text for plaintext emails.

If you’d like to turn on HTML email, go to the Composition & Addressing
page and make sure “Compose messages in HTML format” is checked. *Note:
There are valid arguments against HTML email, but it’s not a security
problem, and some people hate plaintext email. So it’s fine.*

If you do want to use plaintext email, you can enable flowed text by
going to Preferences. In Windows and Linux it’s in the Edit menu, in Mac
OS X it’s in the Thunderbird menu. From there go to Advanced, then the
General tab, and click Config Editor in the bottom right.

[![Thunderbird Config
Editor](https://micahflee.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/enigmail_configeditor1.png)](https://micahflee.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/enigmail_configeditor1.png)

When you open it it says “This might void your warranty!”, but you can
go ahead and click “I’ll be careful, I promise”. This is the exact same
thing as going to about:config in Firefox. Then you can search for
“send\_plaintext\_flowed” and double-click the setting to change the
value from false to true. And by the way, you can change all of
Thunderbird’s preferences from in here too, including ones that don’t
have a GUI for changing, and some of them might break everything, so be
careful.

You might have read today’s shocking
[Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security)
and [New York
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html?_r=0)
articles outlining the many ways that NSA and GCHQ have defeated crypto
on the Internet, and have influenced tech companies to insert back doors
into their commercial security products.

But pay close attention to this paragraph in Guardian’s article:

> The agencies have not yet cracked all encryption technologies,
> however, the documents suggest. Snowden appeared to confirm this
> during a live Q&A with Guardian readers in June. “Encryption works.
> Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things
> that you can rely on,” he said before warning that NSA can frequently
> find ways around it as a result of weak security on the computers at
> either end of the communication.

Giving up and deciding that privacy is dead is *counterproductive*. We
need to stop using commercial crypto. We need to make sure that free
software crypto gets serious security and usability audits.

If we do this right we can still have privacy in the 21st century. If we
give up on security because of this we will definitely lose.

**Update:** This post made the [frontpage of
reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1ladvh/its_2013_were_all_being_spied_on_why_do_security/)
and many of the comments are [wrong](https://xkcd.com/386/). I took a
moment to clear a couple things up at the bottom of the post.

We desperately need to work towards deprecating HTTP and replacing it
only with HTTPS. The web is a huge part of what billions of people use
the Internet for, and still most of it is not encrypted. Since the
Snowden leaks started getting published we’ve learned that NSA and GCHQ
spy on as close to the entire Internet as they can get.

It would be naive to think that the US and UK are the only governments
doing this too. The network isn’t safe, and the only way to make it safe
is to encrypt all the things. Websites that still use HTTP are putting
users in danger. Here are a couple of examples.

If you’re a Windows user and you heard that you can use something called
Off the Record (OTR) to have end-to-end encrypted chats with your
friends, how do you get started?

1.  First you go to [https://pidgin.im/](https://pidgin.im/) and
    download Pidgin. This website forces HTTPS, so you probably haven’t
    gotten hacked yet.
2.  After downloading and installing Pidgin you need to download and
    install the OTR plugin. So you go to
    [http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/) and
    download the latest OTR installer, which at the time of writing is
    [http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/binaries/windows/pidgin-otr-4.0.0-1.exe](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/binaries/windows/pidgin-otr-4.0.0-1.exe).
    This website does not force or even use HTTPS, which means it would
    be trivial for spy agencies or random hackers on your wifi network
    to put malware on your computer.

**For some reason cypherpunks.ca, the website that distributes Windows
binaries of OTR, doesn’t use HTTPS and therefore puts OTR users at
risk.**

Let’s say you’re a Windows user and you’re interested in using OpenPGP
email encryption. How do you get started?

1.  The free software implementation of OpenPGP is GnuPG (GPG), so first
    you go to [http://gnupg.org/](http://gnupg.org/) to see what to do
    next. This websites doesn’t force or even use HTTPS, which means any
    information you find on this website might not be trustworthy, and
    any links to download GPG installers might include malware.
2.  Assuming you haven’t already been hacked, you’ll notice that the
    easiest way to get GPG in Windows is to visit
    [http://www.gpg4win.org/](http://www.gpg4win.org/) and download the
    latest version which, at the time of this writing, is
    [http://files.gpg4win.org/gpg4win-2.2.0.exe](http://files.gpg4win.org/gpg4win-2.2.0.exe).
    It would be trivial for spy agencies or random hackers to replace
    this with a malicious version and put malware on your computer.

**For some reason gnupg.org, the website that distributes information
about and the source code for GPG, and gpg4win.org, the website that
distributes Windows GPG binaries, don’t use HTTPS and therefore puts
their users at risk.**

*Luckily the websites for the Mac OS X software for OTR
([https://adium.im/](https://adium.im/)) and GPG
([https://gpgtools.org/](https://gpgtools.org/)) force HTTPS. And
GNU/Linux users should get this software from their package manager
which uses public key cryptography to authenticate the packages.*

Let’s say you’re really interesting in using disk encryption and you’ve
heard that TrueCrypt might be useful for you. How do you get started?

1.  You visit [http://www.truecrypt.org/](http://www.truecrypt.org/).
    Since this website doesn’t force HTTPS, any information you find on
    this website might not be trustworthy, and any download links might
    contain malware.
2.  When you actually do download the TrueCrypt installer, the download
    links for Windows, Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux all download from URLs
    like http://www.truecrypt.org/download/transient/…. If you download
    and install TrueCrypt from their website, it would be trivial for an
    attacker to put malware on your computer.

**For some reason truecrypt.org, the website that distributes TrueCrypt
binaries for Windows, Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux doesn’t use HTTPS and
therefore puts its users at risk.**

I chose Off the Record, GnuPG, and TrueCrypt because they’re prominent
examples. But the problem is much bigger than these websites. It’s
*almost every website*. It’s not just security software that can put
malware on people’s computers, it’s *any software*.

I understand why *everyone* doesn’t use HTTPS yet.

If your website is hosted on a shared hosting provider you may need to
pay more money for a static IP address to turn on HTTPS. This is
unfortunate, but hopefully shared hosting providers will start using
[Server Name
Indication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) and
make this way cheaper and easier for their customers to run more secure
websites.

But if you’re not a small website stuck on shared hosting, you don’t
have an excuse.

People think that it costs money to get a certificate authority to sign
your cert, but [StartSSL](https://startssl.com/) is trusted by browsers
and signs certs for free.

People say that using HTTPS is a performance hit. Locking your car door
is also a performance hit, and so is putting on clothes in the morning.
Security and privacy is worth a performance hit, especially when *we
have proof that the Internet is being spied on by the most powerful
governments in the world*. Scaling HTTPS is a solved problem, and
performance is no excuse.

If you run a website, and the HTTP version of your site doesn’t
automatically redirect to HTTPS, then you’re doing things wrong. Please
take steps to start supporting HTTPS and then to start forcing HTTPS for
all of your traffic. It’s the responsible thing to do for the privacy
and security of your visitors.

**Update:**\

-   NSA sends legal requests to get data from some companies (such as
    everyone in PRISM) but not from *all* websites. Websites outside of
    the US can legally ignore NSA requests.
-   Certificate authorities don’t have the secret keys of HTTPS web
    servers, they just sign the associated public keys. So no, NSA can’t
    ask CAs for all the keys.
-   NSA passively monitors traffic on the Internet backbones, but they
    can’t see any HTTPS content without having the associated secret
    keys. However if the HTTPS websites use [Perfect Forward
    Secrecy](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/pushing-perfect-forward-secrecy-important-web-privacy-protection),
    even if NSA has the secret key they still can’t see any of the HTTPS
    content.
-   Yes, they can still do active MITM attacks using a compelled CA, but
    they can’t realistically do this *against the entire Internet*, only
    specific targets (tech like [certificate
    pinning](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning),
    [SSL Observatory](https://www.eff.org/observatory), and
    [Convergence](http://convergence.io/) will detect/prevent these
    attacks). One of the reasons that the NSA spying programs are so
    unconstitutional is because they’re *spying on everyone*. If we make
    passive attacks no longer work, forcing NSA to do active attacks,
    that’s a huge win.
-   HTTPS doesn’t protect everything. When you load an HTTPS URL, such
    as
    https://micahflee.com/2013/08/its-2013-were-all-being-spied-on-why-do-security-software-websites-not-use-https/,
    the hostname (“micahflee.com”) gets leaked, but the rest of the URL
    (“/2013/08/its-2013-were-all-being-spied-on-why-do-security-software-websites-not-use-https/”)
    stays private. Other metadata that leaks is your IP address, the
    exact time of the request, and the file sizes of the request and the
    response.

Full disclosure: I’m the maintainer of the free software browser add-on
[HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere). If everyone
used HTTPS and no one used HTTP, HTTPS Everywhere would become obsolete.
I would love it if HTTPS Everywhere were obsolete.

***UPDATE:** The Android bug tracker [isn’t the correct
place](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=57560#c33) to
ask Google to fix this bug. The backup/restore feature is part of the
proprietary Google apps for Android, not the open source Android
project. [This thread on the Google product
forums](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/mobile/android-devices/android-applications/D6vWpQu8AWU)
is the correct place.*

Earlier this week [Ars Technica
covered](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/07/does-nsa-know-your-wifi-password-android-backups-may-give-it-to-them/)
a [bug report](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=57560)
I posted on the Android issue tracker about the “Backup and restore”
feature not offering encrypted backups.

Because there’s no option to encrypt your backup data on your Android
device with a passphrase that you set, Google has the capability to see
the plaintext data, including all your saved wifi passwords. Google can
then be compelled to give up this data (and any other user data that
they store) to the US government when requested to do so.

Google responded to Ars Technica:

> Our optional ‘Backup my data’ feature makes it easier to switch to a
> new Android device by using your Google Account and password to
> restore some of your previous settings. This helps you avoid the
> hassle of setting up a new device from scratch. At any point, you can
> disable this feature, which will cause data to be erased. This data is
> encrypted in transit, accessible only when the user has an
> authenticated connection to Google and stored at Google data centers,
> which have strong protections against digital and physical attacks.

First, it’s great the backup/restore feature is optional. It’s great
that if you turn it off Google will delete your data. It’s great that
the data is encrypted in transit between the Android device and Google’s
servers, so that eavesdroppers can’t pull your backup data off the wire.
And it’s great they they have strong security, both digital and
physical, at their data centers.

However, Google’s statement doesn’t mention whether or not Google itself
has access to the plaintext backup data (it does). Not how easy it is
for an attacker to get at this data, but how easy it is for an
authorized Google employee to get at it as part of their job. This is
important because if Google has access to this plaintext data, they can
be compelled to give it to the US government.

In the bug report I didn’t mention being worried about hackers getting
at the data. I’m worried about Google having the ability to hand this
data to the US government when they receive requests for user data:

> I don’t think it’s rational to expect users to trust Google with their
> plaintext passwords when Google can be compelled to give this data to
> the US government when they request it.

I don’t think Google is being malicious here. I just think they threw
together this backup/restore feature before building in appropriate
security measures. The bug report that I filed is simply a feature
request: make it possible for users who don’t want to give Google our
plaintext wifi passwords (and other backup data) to still use this
feature.

Luckily, Google itself already knows exactly how to do this. The Chrome
web browser saves apps, extensions, settings, autofill data, browser
history, themes, bookmarks, open tabs, and passwords.

Chrome also lets users sync this data with Google’s servers. Clearly
this is a lot of sensitive data, so Google offers to let people encrypt
this data with a passphrase, on their own computer, before sending it to
Google’s servers:

[![chrome\_sync](https://micahflee.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/chrome_sync.png)](https://micahflee.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/chrome_sync.png)

If the user forgets this passphrase they lose all their data.

Offering this same feature (letting users encrypt their backup data with
a passphrase before sending it to Google) for Android is the *only
way*that Google will be able to offer the backup/restore without having
access to the plaintext data that’s being backed up.

**The correct response for Google at this point is to label [issue
57560](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=57560)
(*“Backup and restore” should offer encrypted backups*) as a security
bug, set the priority to High, and promptly release an update to Android
that fixes this bug.**

I also want to point out that this issue isn’t unique to Android.
Apple’s iCloud suffers from the same problem. In fact, any time you use
a service that lets you back things up in the cloud, *if you’re not
encrypting it on your device with a passphrase that you choose*, you’re
giving your data to a third party that’s vulnerable to government
requests for data. It’s also important to remember that the US
government isn’t the only one that requests user data, *all governments
do*. Choosing non-US cloud providers isn’t a solution.

Storing data in the cloud has become a huge convenience for computer
users. Even in light of dragnet unconstitutional surveillance of the
Internet by spy agencies, I don’t think it’s necessary to give up
storing data in the cloud. We just need to store *encrypted* data in the
cloud where *users have the keys*, not the cloud providers.
