### [Finite Differences of Types](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/09/finite-differences-of-types.html)

### Finite Differences of Real-Valued Functions

\
Conor McBride's discovery that you can [differentiate container
types](http://strictlypositive.org/diff.pdf) to get useful constructions
like [zippers](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Zippers) has to be
one of the most amazing things I've seen in computer science. But seeing
the success of differentiation suggests the idea of taking a step back
and looking at finite differences.\
\
Forget about types for the moment and consider functions on a field R.
Given a function f:R→R we can define Δf:R×R→R by\
\

> \
> Δf(x,y) = (f(x)-f(y))/(x-y)\

\
\
Δ is the finite difference operator. But does it make any kind of sense
for types? At first it seems not because we can't define subtraction and
division of types. Can we massage this definition into a form that uses
only addition and multiplication?\
\
First consider Δc where c is a constant function. Then Δc(x,y)=0.\
\
Now consider the identity function i(x)=x. Then Δi(x,y)=1.\
\
Δ is linear in the sense that if f and g are functions, Δ(f+g) = Δf+Δg.\
\
Now consider the product of two functions, f and g.\
\

> \
> Δ(fg)(x,y) = (f(x)g(x)-f(y)g(y))/(x-y)\
> \
> = (f(x)g(x)-f(x)g(y)+f(x)g(y)-f(y)g(y))/(x-y)\
> \
> = f(x)Δg(x,y)+g(y)Δf(x,y)\

\
\
So now we have a Leibniz-like rule. We can compute finite differences of
polynomials without using subtraction or division! What's more, we can
use these formulae to difference algebraic functions defined implicitly
by polynomials. For example consider f(x)=1/(1-x). We can rewrite this
implicitly, using only addition and multiplication, as\

> \
> f(x) = 1+x f(x)\

\
Differencing both sides we get\

> \
> Δf(x,y) = x Δf(x,y)+f(y)\

\
That tells us that Δf(x,y) = f(x)f(y).\
\

### Finite Differences of Types

\
We're now ready to apply our operator to types. Instead of functions on
the reals we work with functors on the set of types. A good first
example container is the functor F(X)=X^N^ for an integer N. This is
basically just an array of N elements of type X. We could apply the
Leibniz rule repeatedly, but we expect to get the same result as if we'd
worked over the reals. So setting f(x)=x^N^ we get\
\

> \
> Δf(x,y) = (x^N^-y^N^)/(x-y) = x^N-1^+x^N-2^y+x^N-3^y^2^+...+y^N-1^\

\
So we know that on types, ΔF(X,Y) = X^N-1^+X^N-2^Y+...+Y^N-1^.\
\
There's a straightforward interpretation we can give this.
Differentiating a type makes a hole in it. Finite differencing makes a
hole in it, but everything to the left of the hole is of one type and
everything on the right is another. For example, for F(X)=X^3^,
ΔF(X,Y)=X^2^+XY+Y^2^ can be drawn as:\
[![image](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_UdKHLrHa05M/Sr-MLg52-hI/AAAAAAAAAYM/twUQVqZChek/s400/dissection.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_UdKHLrHa05M/Sr-MLg52-hI/AAAAAAAAAYM/twUQVqZChek/s1600-h/dissection.png)\
If you've been reading the right papers then at this point it should all
become familiar. Finite differencing is none other than dissection, as
described by Conor in his [Jokers and Clowns
paper](http://strictlypositive.org/CJ.pdf). I don't know if he was aware
that he was talking about finite differences - the paper itself talks
about this being a type of derivative. It's sort of implicit when he
writes the isomorphism:\

> \
> `right :: p j + (Δp c j , c) → (j , Δp c j ) + p c`\

\
With a little rearrangement this becomes the definition of finite
difference.\
\
Now that we've recognised dissection as finite difference we can reason
informally about dissection using high school algebra. For example, we
already know that lists, defined by L(X) = 1+X L(X) can be informally
thought of as L(X)=1/(1-X). So using the example I gave above we see
that ΔL(X,Y)=1/((1-X)(1-Y)) = L(X)L(Y). So the dissection of a list is a
pair of lists, one for the left elements, and one for the right
elements. Just what we'd expect.\
\
Another example. Consider the trees defined by T(X)=X+T(X)^2^.
Informally we can interpret this as T(X)=(1+√(1-4X))/2. A little
algebraic manipulation, using (√x-√y)(√x+√y) = x-y shows that\

> \
> ΔT(X,Y) = 1/(1-(T(X)+T(Y))\

\
\
In other words, a dissection of a tree is a list of trees, each of which
is a tree of X or a tree of Y. This corresponds to the fact that if you
dissect a tree at some element, and then follow the path from the root
to the hole left behind, then all of the left branches (in blue) are
trees of type X and all of the right branches (in red) are trees of type
Y.\
[![image](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_UdKHLrHa05M/Sr-MB-2VZ-I/AAAAAAAAAYE/NSXxMj4mt8o/s400/tree.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_UdKHLrHa05M/Sr-MB-2VZ-I/AAAAAAAAAYE/NSXxMj4mt8o/s1600-h/tree.png)\
If you're geometrically inclined then you can think of types with holes
in them as being a kind of tangent to the space of types. Along those
lines, dissections become secants. I think this geometric analogy can be
taken a lot further and that in fact a non-trivial piece of differential
geometry can be made to work with types. But that's for another day.\
\
Oh, I almost forgot. Derivatives are what you get when you compute
finite differences for points really close to each other. So I hope you
can see that Δf(x,x)=df/dx giving us holes in terms of dissections.
Conor mentions this in his paper.\
\
We should also be able to use this approach to compute finite
differences in other algebraic structures that don't have subtraction or
division.\
\
I can leave you with some exercises:\
\
1. What does finite differencing mean when applied to both [ordinary and
exponential generating
functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_function)?\
\
2. Can you derive the "chain rule" for finite differences? This can be
useful when you compute dissections of types defined by sets of mutually
recursive definitions.\
\
3. Why is `right`, defined above, a massaged version of the definition
of finite difference? (Hint: define d=((f(x)-f(y))/(x-y). In this
equation, eliminate the division by a suitable multiplication and
eliminate the subtraction by a suitable addition. And remember that
`(,)` is Haskell notation for the product of types.)

You should investigate interval arithmetic and interval constraints.
Interval constraints are used to deal with the explosive ranges that
accumulate with interval arithmetic. This is relevant to floating point
numbers so you can have very accurate calculations (bounded by the
smallest different floating numbers possible).\

I find finitely differentiating T(X)=X+T(X)\^2 directly easier. It
becomes ΔT(X,Y) = 1 + (T(X) + T(Y))ΔT(X,Y) which is obviously a list of
(T(X) + T(Y)).\
\
One typo: "That tells us that Δf(x,y) = 1/(f(x)f(y))." I think you got 2
formulas confused here.

I just did the tree example to show it works even for algebraic
functions like square root, not to show it's easier :-) But in general,
I find thinking about dissection as finite differences does make it a
lot easier.

Okay - so categorically this is requiring finite products, finite sums
(and exponentials for your X\^N example)?\
\
What I'd be very curious about is how well this generalizes to
categories with less structure - monoidal instead of cartesian, for
instance.

I think that\

(f(x)g(x)-f(x)g(y)+f(x)g(y)-f(y)g(y)/(x-y)\
\
is missing a paren before the /. \

(f(x)g(x)-f(x)g(y)+f(x)g(y)-f(y)g(y))/(x-y)

Creighton,\
\
No exponentials needed here as N is an integer.\
\
With a bit of trickery I did once sort of get exponentials going with
derivatives. But I don't think anything similar will work for finite
differences and exponentials.

You refer to X\^N as the type of arrays of elements of X of length N,
but shouldn't they be thought of instead as N-tuples? (I guess it's a
minor difference in terminology, but I think of ‘array’ as specifically
connoting extensibility, with some sort of push/pull operation.)

What about second order dissectioning?\
F.e. Δ\^2(FG)(X,Y,Z) = F(X)Δ\^2G(X,Y,Z) + ΔF(X,Y)ΔG(Y,Z) +
Δ\^2F(X,Y,Z)G(Z)\
(I.e. both holes in G, one hole in F and one in G or both holes in F.)\
\
I couldn't manage to derive this from second order finite difference.
But maybe I did something wrong.

Ah, I forgot that you can choose which hole goes to F and which to G.\
So: Δ\^2(FG)(X,Y,Z) = F(X)Δ\^2G(X,Y,Z) + 2ΔF(X,Y)ΔG(Y,Z) +
Δ\^2F(X,Y,Z)G(Z)\
\
This can be derived from Δ\^2(f)(x,y,z) = (f(x) - 2f(y) + f(z)) / (x -
y) / (y - z)

Perhaps my question makes no sense, but what would it mean to define the
"exponential" type as the type that is equal to its own derivative? \
\
Or, can you do "type" differential equations?

Still doesn't seem right. Can't get the chain rule to work. Looking at
the holes it should be something like:\
\
Δ\^2(FG)(X,Y,Z) = Δ\^2G(X,Y,Z)DF(G(X),G(Z)) +
DG(X,Y)DG(Y,Z)Δ\^2F(G(X),G(Y),G(Z))\
\
(I.e. the 2 holes in the same part of F or in different parts of F)

Sjoerd, there's no need for second differences in the chain rule. We
want the first difference of the composition of two functions:\
\
Informally:\
\
Δ(F o G)(X,Y)\
=(F(G(X))-F(G(Y)))/(X-Y)\
=(F(G(X)-F(G(Y))/(G(X)-G(Y)) . (G(X)-G(Y))/(X-Y)\
= ΔF(G(X),G(Y)) . ΔG(X,Y)\
\
That can now be verified using Conor's definition of dissection. When
Y=X we get the usual chain rule.\
\
I think this would have been tricky to derive without seeing dissection
as finite difference.

I was specifically going for the second difference of function
composition, i.e. the difference equivalent of (fg)''(x) =
f''(g(x))g\^2(x) + g''(x)f'(g(x))\
\
The problem is that I'm not sure about what the formula of second order
difference should be exactly.\
\
But I agree that having the difference view makes things easier.\
\
I derived the first difference by guessing what the difference
equivalent of the chain rule would be, and confirming the result by
filling in the difference formulas.\
\
Conor will probably agree as well, as the C&J paper says: "Of course,
what’s missing here is a more semantic characterisation of dissection,
with respect to which the operational rules for /|\\ p may be
justified."

leihaus,\

I just talked about the easy case of an N-element array
[here](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2008/03/comonadic-arrays.html). Otherwise
it's all in Conor's papers.

Jon,\
\
Interesting! That looks remarkably like a side project of mine.
Unfortunately I can't read the web site right now because despite
following lots of instructions I've never managed to make the fonts work
for the n-category cafe under Linux. I'll see how it looks under MacOSX
tonight.

I'm really new to this stuff, but I find it fascinating. I'm a bit
confused however: what does it mean to add two types together? i.e. it
makes sense to me that X\^2 is (X,X), but I don't understand, for
example, why a list of Xs has type L(X)=1+X L(X). Do we just think of +
as a form of union? Could you recommend a reference on this stuff?\
\
Thanks! Duncan

Duncan,\
\
You could try [here](http://sigfpe.com/Computing/diff.html) if you're
not a Haskell programmer (yet). '+' is disjoint union. Another place is
[here](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Zippers).

care to spill the beans on what you're thinking of? =)
