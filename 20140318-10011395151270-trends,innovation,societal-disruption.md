5 Technologies That Will Change the World
=========================================

Written by [Jason Kolb,](http://www.jasonkolb.com/author/jason/)March
16th, 2014

***Warning**: The following post contains moments of wild speculation.
You have been warned.*

Right now is an interesting moment in the history of civilization. In
the past technology has molded itself to the needs of society, but we’ve
passed that point. In the last 15 years we’ve started to see society
molding itself to technology instead.

***TL;DR** Distributed proof of ownership, anonymity, crowdfunding, the
subscription economy, and location-based services–taken together, at the
intersections–are going to rock your world.*

We’ve reached a saturation point where technology is so pervasive–mostly
due to smartphones, little computers we carry around with us–that what
used to be wild speculation now seems just around the corner. Society
has pretty much absorbed the change inherent in a global network
connecting every person to every other person, and the main behavioral
changes can be summed up by looking at Facebook and Twitter. (Clearly
business has been impacted substantially as well, but I’m talking mostly
about changes to day to day life.)

Here are five technologies that seem poised to break out on the world in
the next few years, and how they will change our lives. The most
interesting aspect of these to me is how they interact when used
together–the intersections of these disruptive technologies are where
you can start really understanding how these will change the world in
concrete ways. Like layer cakes, they get even more delicious when you
eat them together.

1. Distributed Proof of Ownership
---------------------------------

If you’ve followed Bitcoin [[1]](#1), you know how disruptive this can
be. (By the way, there’s nothing like an unauthorized demo to convince
people of disruptive technology.) But Bitcoin is one implementation of a
distributed proof of ownership protocol which results in the a
*blockchain*: a distributed ledger that says who owns what.

![image](http://res.cloudinary.com/dwnulwfff/image/upload/v1395059525/http_cdn1_sbnation_com_imported_assets_1568709_bitcoinchain_wdcero.png)

That may sound boring, but think of all the intermediaries that exist
today only because they’re a trusted third party for proving ownership:
DNS registrars, stock exchanges, title registrations with governments,
central banks, and so many more. Many of the most powerful organizations
in the world exist because you need some way to prove who owns what.

Now you can start trying to wrap your head around what blockchains will
do in the future when they’re used for more than just Bitcoin. To name a
very specific example that you can look at today, Namecoin [[2]](#2) is
a new way to prove ownership of a domain name, which makes obsolete
ICANN and domain registrars (at least, as they exist today). It’s still
early, but more are on the way.

2. Anonymity
------------

The Internet has never really been anonymous, as Edward Snowden recently
showed us. But there are technologies emerging that make it anonymous.
Tor [[3]](#3) is the best known, but there are others as well such as
I2P [[4]](#4) that improve on Tor–a healthy sign for any new technology.
These are still very cutting edge, which means they’re not usable by the
average consumer and we haven’t truly seen their impact yet.

The change brought by online anonymity thus far has been very
politically-oriented. It has allowed whistleblowers to anonymously share
documents with reporters [[5]](#5) and Wikileaks as well as let people
anonymously buy drugs online.

The use of anonymity is spreading, and although I’m sure this will be
fought tooth and nail by many lobbyists I don’t believe it can be
stopped. It will be an interesting legal battle I’m sure, although I
have no idea how you’d enforce any kind of illegality.

-   ### 2.a. Distributed Proof of Ownership + Anonymity

    Now that we have proof of ownership, and anonymity, you can own
    something anonymously. This is what has people concerned about
    Bitcoin–the fact that you can anonymously own lots of money. But
    when you extrapolate that out to everything else that you can now
    own anonymously, things get interesting.

    You’ll be able to anonymously own stocks, cars, houses, and creative
    works. Obviously there will be a clash with some of the more highly
    regulated industries–for example anonymously owning a house is a
    long way off, but I can certainly forsee a time when you could
    anonymously own a copyright and even collect payment on it
    anonymously.

3. Crowdfunding
---------------

![image](http://res.cloudinary.com/dwnulwfff/image/upload/c_scale,w_300/v1395059883/http_www_savorthesuccess_com_uploads_images_userfolder_9480_crowdfunding1_nnjvtd.jpg)

The concept of crowdfunding is still young. So far you’ve seen
individual ideas being funded on Kickstarter[[6]](#6), and to a smaller
degree you’re seeing companies funded in this way as well on Angel
List[[7]](#7). But because it effectively breaks down large investments
into smaller chunks, thus spreading the risk around, it completely
changes the way an average person will start to think about risk. And
it’s changing everything from investing to philanthropy (see
Kiva[[8]](#8)). You’re even starting to see instances of crowdfunding
medical treatements[[9]](#9)–talk about a different kind of healthcare
system.

>  [9] [Meet Ryan
> ![image](http://www.jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/external_link.jpg)](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meet-ryan)

-   ### 3.a. Crowdfunding + Distributed Proof of Ownership

    Now things start getting interesting. You’re already seeing
    crowdfunding for ownership in limited doses such as the AngelList
    mentioned earlier. But that’s still a middle-man. Imagine instead
    that you could instantly buy shares in a company and those shares
    would be put in your ledger on the blockchain, and the money would
    flow straight to the company’s account. And dividends straight back
    to you. Or, for a more pedestrian example, you’d be able to quickly
    set up a timeshare by offering real estate as a crowdfunded project
    with the blockchain providing the record of ownership.

-   ### 3.b. Crowdfunding + Anonymity

    This is going to absolutely revolutionize fund raising. Money talks,
    and who you choose to donate money to says a lot about you. Many
    people who would otherwise donate to controversial movements and
    figures (think Wikileaks and Edward Snowden, for an immediate
    example) hesitate because of potential blowback in the form of
    ending up on a watch list and being patted down extra-vigorously
    every time they travel. Want to help fund the resistance in some
    other country? There you go.

-   ### 3.c. Crowdfunding + Distributed Proof of Ownership + Anonymity

    With this potent combination you could instantly own a tiny part of
    something without anyone else knowing. Want to silently take over a
    company? Anonymously buy up their stock. Want to buy an oil field in
    Iran without the government knowing? No problem.

4. The Subscription Economy
---------------------------

![image](http://res.cloudinary.com/dwnulwfff/image/upload/c_scale,w_300/v1395059945/https_support_apple_com_library_APPLE_APPLECARE_ALLGEOS_HT4098_HT4098_02--subscription_status-001-en_bjn9na.png)

This is more of a societal change enabled by technology, but it touches
a lot of things. You’re starting to see people buy everything as a
subscription from diapers[10] to clothing[11]. This is a big change in
behavior and it has yet to touch a few important industries. For
example, you’ll be able to subscribe to monthly dinner clubs and resort
experiences.

-   ### 4.a. Subscription Economy + Distributed Proof of Ownership

    This is going to completely disrupt how debt works because it
    doesn’t require banks in order to break down large purchases into
    palatable chunks. People could easily own a small fraction of a
    house and create pools of ownership that allow people to buy things
    on a subscription basis. You could, for example, buy $500 worth of a
    house and then get $15 a month in return for a rental, or $5 a month
    in exchange for a small percentage of your ownership stake.

-   ### 4.b. Subscription Economy + Anonymity

    This might allow people to anonymously own something and sell
    portions of it on a monthly basis, just like a house. For example
    you could own a small percentage of a helicopter or tank that’s sold
    to one side of a civil war. Or, you could buy your drugs on a weekly
    or monthly basis.

-   ### 4.c. Subscription Economy + Crowdfunding

    People already make investments on a monthly basis, and have for a
    while. However, you could now directly fund small business’ cashflow
    in return for equity. This may result in companies making stock
    offerings on an as-needed basis to cover short-term funding gaps–in
    return for a high-risk investment you could get into the earliest
    stages of a company. Mutual funds and investment funds become very
    interesting in this context as they could easily turn into pure risk
    management vehicles.

    This combination is also interesting because if set up properly it
    could enable groups of people to jointly purchase something
    expensive (say, a group of patients with cancer to buy an MRI
    machine or a neighborhood to buy a truck) and make use of it on a
    periodic basis. Just like timeshares it would spread the cost
    around, but for other expensive items which aren’t used constantly.

5. Location Services
--------------------

![image](http://res.cloudinary.com/dwnulwfff/image/upload/c_scale,w_300/v1395060007/http_images_dailytech_com_nimage_applications1_ezsyii.jpg)

Apple once again (for the last time?) introduced a nascent technology to
the general public when they unveiled iBeacon[[12]](#12), an
implementation of accurate, location-aware technology. I’m fascinated by
this technology because of the new possibilities it opens up in
meatspace (face-to-face) interactions. For example, I’m working on
skunkworks project right now that would allow a restaurant to greet you
by name and offer you your favorite cocktail when you walk in the door.

You’re just now starting to see the first public uses of this
technology–it was recently used at the Superbowl, for
example[[13]](#13). I expect this one to take off quite soon.

### 5.a. Location Services + Proof of Ownership

I struggle to think of solid practical uses for this, but you could
prove how much of the ownership of a (house, car, political party,
senate) is present in any one location. Or, you could potentially pass
ownership of something to someone just by knowing their location.

### 5.b. Location Services + Anonymity

If you thought Twitter was disruptive for organizing events in
real-time, this should be really interesting. You could anonymously
prove membership in an organization using distributed proof-of-ownership
and conversely you could prove LACK of membership. Subverting movements
like Occupy Wall Street by infiltrating them will become much more
difficult.

### 5.c. Location Services + Subscription Economy

You could subscribe to either products, services, or experiences, and
pick up your product from whichever supplier is nearest to you when it’s
convenient. This would be very disruptive to delivery services in
general. Subscribe to a daily cup of coffee and pick it up from
whichever Starbucks you’re closest to. Or subscribe to a daily lunch and
pick it up from a number of different restaurants you walk past.

Summary
-------

These are the five technologies that I believe have the most immediate
potential to change our daily lives. I could easily add predictive data
mining to this list but I’ll save that for another series of blog posts.
