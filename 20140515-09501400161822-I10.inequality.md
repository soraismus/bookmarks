Jacob Goldstein from the Planet Money team reports on a big, buzz-worthy
new book from one of the world's leading experts on inequality.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

A few decades ago, inequality started rising in countries around the
world. That came as a shock to many economists who originally thought
inequality tended to go down over time. They wondered how inequality
could rise in so many different places at once. Well, now a new book by
one of the world's leading experts on the topic suggests an answer to
that mystery. Jacob Goldstein, of our Planet Money team, reports.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: The book is called "Capital in the Twenty-First
Century." Here's the author.

THOMAS PIKETTY: My name is Thomas Piketty. I teach at the Paris School
of Economics.

GOLDSTEIN: Piketty's book is big in every sense of the word. It's almost
700 pages long. It makes big, sweeping claims about history and the
nature of capitalism. Basically, it's the "it" book that every economist
is taking to the beach this summer. Here's Steven Durlauf, of the
University of Wisconsin.

STEVEN DURLAUF: The aspect that I think is extraordinary is the fact
that it developed a vision that is this big, in terms of thinking about
how societies evolve.

GOLDSTEIN: To get to this big vision about how societies evolved to
solve the mystery of rising inequality, Piketty started out by reading a
bunch of old novels: Jane Austen, Henry James and especially, Balzac. He
was not in it for the love stories.

PIKETTY: All of Balzac's novels are a lot about money. And in fact, all
of, you know, 19th century novels are a lot about money.

GOLDSTEIN: Piketty got obsessed with the way inequality was portrayed in
this one Balzac story. A young, penniless nobleman moves to Paris to
study law, and he meets an ex-con. The ex-con sits him down and
basically says, look, work is for suckers. And the ex-con actually goes
through all the math. He says, say you become a judge. This is how much
you'll make. If you make all the right connections and get really lucky,
maybe you'll get to be a prosecutor general. Then you'll make this much.
But no matter how lucky you get, the ex-con tells the nobleman, you are
not going to get rich by working. You want to get rich? Marry that
heiress who lives down the hall.

PIKETTY: And, you know, for a long time I was wondering, is it only
because Balzac was personally obsessed with money, or was he really
describing something real?

GOLDSTEIN: Piketty dives into the numbers. He figures out what lawyers
made back then, goes through tax receipts, looks at inheritances; and he
realizes the ex-con was right. It was almost impossible to get rich by
working, in Balzac's world. It was a world where to get rich, you
basically had to inherit money or marry someone who did.

Then Piketty digs through numbers for more countries - the U.S.,
England, Germany, Japan - not just in the 19th century but the 20th and
the 21st. And he comes up with this grand theory, his theory of
everything. Piketty says, take any society and look at how much money
people are making on their investments. When they buy stock or bonds or
rent out land, how do they do?

If those investments are growing faster than the rest of the economy,
you're likely to have a society where inequality is increasing - where
wealth is piling up in fewer hands. This is what was happening in the
Balzac world. It's also what's been happening in the U.S. and other
developed countries for the past several decades.

But sometimes, the opposite is true. In fact, a lot of the economists
working today grew up at a time when inequality was falling. In the
1950s and '60s, the economy was growing really fast. Investments were
not growing so fast. So many economists came to believe this was just
the normal state of affairs. In modern economies, they thought,
inequality just tends to fall.

BRANKO MILANOVIC: And we've had big problem explaining why inequality
then picked up again in the 1970s, in the 1980s and 1990s, and now.

GOLDSTEIN: This is Branko Milanovic, an economist at the City University
of New York. He says Piketty looks at the big sweep of history, and
figures a big chunk of the 20th century was a really unusual economic
period. You had a world war, a depression, another world war, and then a
massive post-war boom.

MILANOVIC: Piketty would say that was not a normal world. That was
really an exceptional world. And you know, that is where, actually, this
perception that Piketty brings in is so dramatically different.

GOLDSTEIN: The normal world, according to Piketty, is the world we're in
now - the world where inequality is increasing. Now, that does not mean
we're back to that Balzac world. For one thing, today there is a middle
class with some wealth; people who own their homes, who have some money
saved for retirement. But Piketty says that may not be true in the long
run.

PIKETTY: The key question is, is that going to last? So are we going to
have an expanding middle class, in terms of wealth, or are we going to
have a shrinking middle class?

GOLDSTEIN: Piketty argues that unless there are some big policy changes,
wealth is likely to become more and more concentrated among the very
rich. Inheritance will become a bigger deal. And it'll be harder to get
ahead by working. Jacob Goldstein, NPR News.
