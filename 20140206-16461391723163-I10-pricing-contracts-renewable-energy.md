A **feed-in tariff** (**FIT**, **standard offer
contract**)^[[1]](#cite_note-nrel.gov-1)^ **advanced renewable
tariff**^[[2]](#cite_note-2)^ or **renewable energy
payments**^[[3]](#cite_note-3)^ is a policy mechanism designed to
accelerate investment in [renewable
energy](/wiki/Renewable_energy "Renewable energy") technologies. It
achieves this by offering long-term contracts to renewable energy
producers, typically based on the cost of generation of each
technology.^[[1]](#cite_note-nrel.gov-1)^^[[4]](#cite_note-Couture.2C_T._2010-4)^
Rather than pay an equal amount for energy, however generated,
technologies such as wind power, for instance, are awarded a lower
per-kWh price, while technologies such as [solar
PV](/wiki/Solar_PV "Solar PV") and [tidal
power](/wiki/Tidal_power "Tidal power") are offered a higher price,
reflecting costs that are higher at the moment.

In addition, feed-in tariffs often include "tariff degression", a
mechanism according to which the price (or tariff) ratchets down over
time. This is done in order to
track^[[4]](#cite_note-Couture.2C_T._2010-4)^^:p.25^ and encourage
technological cost
reductions.^[[1]](#cite_note-nrel.gov-1)^^:p.100^^[[5]](#cite_note-5)^
The goal of feed-in tariffs is to offer cost-based compensation to
renewable energy producers, providing price certainty and long-term
contracts that help finance renewable energy
investments.^[[4]](#cite_note-Couture.2C_T._2010-4)^^[[6]](#cite_note-6)^

Description[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Description")]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FITs typically include three key
provisions:^[[7]](#cite_note-7)^^[[8]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-8)^

-   guaranteed [grid access](/wiki/Grid_access "Grid access")
-   long-term contracts
-   cost-based purchase prices

Under a feed-in tariff, eligible [renewable
electricity](/wiki/Renewable_electricity "Renewable electricity")
generators, including homeowners, business owners, farmers and private
investors, are paid a cost-based price for the renewable electricity
they supply to the grid. This enables diverse technologies (wind, solar,
biogas, etc.) to be developed and provides investors a reasonable
return. This principle was explained in Germany's 2000 RES Act:

> The compensation rates...have been determined by means of scientific
> studies, subject to the provision that the rates identified should
> make it possible for an installation – when managed efficiently – to
> be operated cost-effectively, based on the use of
> [state-of-the-art](/wiki/State-of-the-art "State-of-the-art")
> technology and depending on the renewable energy sources naturally
> available in a given geographical
> environment.^[[9]](#cite_note-Germany_2000-9)^

As a result, the tariff (or rate) may differ by technology, location
(e.g. rooftop or ground-mounted for [solar
PV](/wiki/Solar_PV "Solar PV") projects), size (residential or
commercial scale) and region.^[[8]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-8)^ The
tariffs are typically designed to decline over time to track and
encourage technological change.^[[4]](#cite_note-Couture.2C_T._2010-4)^

FITs typically offer a guaranteed purchase agreement for long (15–25
year)
periods.^[[1]](#cite_note-nrel.gov-1)^^[[10]](#cite_note-Lipp.2C_J._2007-10)^

Performance-based rates give incentives to producers to maximize the
output and efficiency of their project.^[[11]](#cite_note-11)^

As of
2010^[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit)^,
feed-in tariff policies had been enacted in over 50 countries, including
Algeria, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Cyprus, the
Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,
Iran, Republic of Ireland, Israel, Italy, Kenya, the Republic of Korea,
Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, Spain,
Switzerland, Tanzania, Thailand, and
Turkey.^[[12]](#cite_note-ren21_2010-12)^ In early 2012 in Spain, the
Rajoy administration suspended the Feed-in tariff for new
projects.^[[13]](#cite_note-ren21_2012-13)^

In 2008, a detailed analysis by the [European
Commission](/wiki/European_Commission "European Commission") concluded
that "well-adapted feed-in tariff regimes are generally the most
efficient and effective support schemes for promoting renewable
electricity".^[[14]](#cite_note-ec.europa.eu-14)^ This conclusion was
supported by other analyses, including by the [International Energy
Agency](/wiki/International_Energy_Agency "International Energy Agency"),^[[15]](#cite_note-15)^^[[16]](#cite_note-16)^
the [European Federation for Renewable
Energy](/w/index.php?title=European_Federation_for_Renewable_Energy&action=edit&redlink=1 "European Federation for Renewable Energy (page does not exist)"),^[[17]](#cite_note-17)^
as well as by [Deutsche

### Compensation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Compensation")]

[![image](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Feed-in_Tariff_meter_connections.png/220px-Feed-in_Tariff_meter_connections.png)](/wiki/File:Feed-in_Tariff_meter_connections.png)

Understanding Feed-in Tariff and Power Purchase Agreement meter
connections

There are three methods of compensation.

-   Feed-in tariff - compensation is above retail, and as the percentage
    of adopters increases, the FIT is reduced to the retail rate.
-   [Net metering](/wiki/Net_metering "Net metering") - allows producers
    to consume electricity from the grid, e.g., when the wind stops.
    Credits typically roll over to future periods. Payments (to the
    utility or the consumer) depend on net consumption.
-   [Power Purchase
    Agreement](/wiki/Power_Purchase_Agreement "Power Purchase Agreement")
    - pays for the generation of electricity and is normally below the
    retail rate, although in the case of solar can be higher, because
    solar tends to be produced closer to peak demand.

History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: History")]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### United States[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: United States")]

The first form of feed-in tariff (under another name) was implemented in
the US in 1978 under President [Jimmy
Carter](/wiki/Jimmy_Carter "Jimmy Carter"), who signed the [National
Energy Act](/wiki/National_Energy_Act "National Energy Act") (NEA). This
law included five separate Acts, one of which was the [Public Utility
Regulatory Policies
Act](/wiki/Public_Utility_Regulatory_Policies_Act "Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act")
(PURPA). The purpose of the National Energy Act was to encourage [energy
conservation](/wiki/Energy_conservation "Energy conservation") and
develop new energy resources, including
[renewables](/wiki/Renewable "Renewable") such as wind, solar and
geothermal
power.^[[19]](#cite_note-19)^^[[20]](#cite_note-Hirsh.2C_R._F._1999_pp._60-72-20)^

Within PURPA was a provision that required utilities to purchase
electricity generated from qualifying independent power producers at
rates not to exceed their avoided
cost.^[[20]](#cite_note-Hirsh.2C_R._F._1999_pp._60-72-20)^ Avoided costs
were designed to reflect the cost that a utility would incur to provide
that same electrical generation. Different interpretations of PURPA
prevailed in the 1980s: some utilities and state utility commissions
interpreted avoided costs narrowly to mean avoided fuel costs, while
others chose to define "avoided costs" as the "avoided long-run marginal
cost" of
generation.^[[20]](#cite_note-Hirsh.2C_R._F._1999_pp._60-72-20)^ The
long-run costs referred to the anticipated cost of electricity in the
years ahead. This last approach was adopted by California in its
Standard Offer Contract No. 4.^[[21]](#cite_note-21)^ Another provision
included in the PURPA law was that utilities were prevented from owning
more than 50% of projects, to encourage new
entrants.^[[20]](#cite_note-Hirsh.2C_R._F._1999_pp._60-72-20)^

To comply with PURPA, some states began offering Standard Offer
Contracts to producers. California's Public Utility Commission
established a number of Standard Offer Contracts, including Standard
Offer No.4 (SO4), which made use of fixed prices, based on the expected
long-run cost of generation. The long-run estimates of electricity costs
were based on the belief (widely held at the time) that oil and gas
prices would continue to increase.^[[22]](#cite_note-boell.org-22)^ This
led to an escalating schedule of fixed purchase prices, designed to
reflect the long-run avoided costs of new electrical generation. By
1992, private power producers had installed approximately 1,700 MW of
wind capacity in California, some of which is still in service today.
The adoption of PURPA also led to significant renewable energy
generation in states such as Florida, and
Maine.^[[20]](#cite_note-Hirsh.2C_R._F._1999_pp._60-72-20)^

This notwithstanding, PURPA retains negative connotations in the U.S.
electricity industry. When oil and gas prices plummeted in the late
1980s, the Standard Offer Contracts that were signed to encourage new
renewable energy development seemed high by comparison. As a result,
PURPA contracts came to be seen as an expensive burden on electricity
ratepayers.^[[22]](#cite_note-boell.org-22)^

Another source of opposition to PURPA stemmed from the fact that it was
designed to encourage non-utility generation. This was interpreted as a
threat by many large utilities, particularly monopolistic suppliers. As
a result of its encouragement of non-utility generation, PURPA has also
been interpreted as an important step toward increasing
competition.^[[20]](#cite_note-Hirsh.2C_R._F._1999_pp._60-72-20)^

### Europe[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Europe")]

In 1990, Germany adopted its "Stromeinspeisungsgesetz" (StrEG), or "Law
on Feeding Electricity into the
Grid".^[[23]](#cite_note-Germany.2C_Stromeinspeisungsgesetz_1990-23)^
The StrEG required utilities to purchase electricity generated from
renewable energy suppliers at a percentage of the prevailing retail
price of electricity. The percentage offered to solar and wind power was
set at 90% of the residential electricity price, while other
technologies such as hydro power and biomass sources were offered
percentages ranging from 65–80%. A project cap of 5 MW was
included.^[[23]](#cite_note-Germany.2C_Stromeinspeisungsgesetz_1990-23)^

While Germany's StrEG was insufficient to encourage costlier
technologies such as photovoltaics, it proved relatively effective at
encouraging lower-cost technologies such as wind, leading to the
deployment of 4,400 MW of new wind capacity between 1991 and 1999,
representing approximately one third of the global capacity at the
time.^[[9]](#cite_note-Germany_2000-9)^

An additional challenge that StrEG addressed was the right to
interconnect to the grid. The StrEG guaranteed renewable electricity
producers grid access.^[[9]](#cite_note-Germany_2000-9)^ Similar
percentage-based feed-in laws were adopted in
Spain,^[[24]](#cite_note-24)^ as well as in
Denmark^[[25]](#cite_note-Munksgaard.2C_J_2008-25)^ in the 1990s.

### Germany's Renewable Energy Sources Act[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Germany's Renewable Energy Sources Act")]

Germany's Feed-in Law underwent a major restructuring in 2000, re-framed
as the Act on Granting Priority to Renewable Energy Sources
("Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz", [German Renewable Energy
Act](/wiki/German_Renewable_Energy_Act "German Renewable Energy Act")).^[[9]](#cite_note-Germany_2000-9)^
In its new form, it proved to be the world's most effective policy
framework at accelerating the renewable
deployment.^[[26]](#cite_note-Jacobsson.2C_S._2006_pp._256-26)^

Important changes included:

1.  Purchase prices were based on generation cost. This led to different
    prices for wind power, solar power, biomass/biogas and geothermal
    and for projects of different sizes.
2.  Purchase guarantees were extended to 20 years.
3.  Utilities were allowed to participate.
4.  Rates were designed to decline annually based on expected cost
    reductions, known as "tariff
    degression".^[[26]](#cite_note-Jacobsson.2C_S._2006_pp._256-26)^

Since it was the most successful, the German policy (amended in 2004 and
2008) often was the benchmark against which other feed-in tariff
policies were considered.

Other countries followed the German approach. Long-term contracts are
typically offered in a non-discriminatory manner to all renewable energy
producers. Because purchase prices are based on costs, efficiently
operated projects yield a reasonable rate of
return.^[[10]](#cite_note-Lipp.2C_J._2007-10)^^[[27]](#cite_note-feed-in-cooperation.org-27)^

This principle was stated as:

> "The compensation rates...have been determined by means of scientific
> studies, subject to the proviso that the rates identified should make
> it possible for an installation – when managed efficiently – to be
> operated cost-effectively, based on the use of state-of-the-art
> technology and depending on the renewable energy sources naturally
> available in a given geographical
> environment."^[[9]](#cite_note-Germany_2000-9)^
>
> —2000 RES Act

Feed-in tariff policies typically target a 5–10% return.

Feed-in tariffs (REFIT) supported growth in solar power in Spain,
Germany and wind power in Denmark.^[[28]](#cite_note-28)^

The success of photovoltaics in Germany resulted in a electricity price
drop of up to 40% during peak output
times,^[[29]](#cite_note-Parkinson27032012-29)^ with savings between
€520 million and 840 million for
consumers.^[[30]](#cite_note-Parkinson13022012-30)^^[[31]](#cite_note-Parkinson27022012-31)^
Savings for consumers have meant conversely reductions in the profit
margin of big [electric power
companies](/wiki/Electric_utility "Electric utility"), who reacted by
lobbying the German government, which reduced subsidies in
2012.^[[31]](#cite_note-Parkinson27022012-31)^ Energy utilities lobbied
for the abolition, or against the introduction, of feed-in tariffs in
other parts of the world, including Australia and
California.^[[29]](#cite_note-Parkinson27032012-29)^^[[32]](#cite_note-32)^
Increase in the solar energy share in Germany also had the effect of
closing gas- and coal-fired generation plants.^[[33]](#cite_note-33)^

Effects on electricity rates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Effects on electricity rates")]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FiTs have had both increased and decreased effects on electricity
prices.^[[34]](#cite_note-PURC-34)^

Increases have been attributed to the fact that renewable energy is
typically more expensive than electricity generated from conventional
sources.^[[35]](#cite_note-35)^ Increases of approximately four Euros
per month per household were recorded in Germany.^[[36]](#cite_note-36)^
However, renewable energy can reduce spot market prices via the [merit
order effect](/wiki/Merit_order "Merit order"), the practice of using
higher-cost fossil fuel facilities only when demand exceeds the capacity
of lower cost
facilities.^[[37]](#cite_note-Sensfuss.2C_F._2009-37)^^[[38]](#cite_note-38)^
This has led to electricity price reductions in
Spain,^[[39]](#cite_note-39)^
Denmark^[[25]](#cite_note-Munksgaard.2C_J_2008-25)^ and
Germany.^[[37]](#cite_note-Sensfuss.2C_F._2009-37)^^[[40]](#cite_note-40)^

Grid parity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Grid parity")]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grid parity occurs when the cost of an alternative technology for
electricity production matches the existing average for the area. Parity
can vary both in time (i.e. during the course of the day and over the
course of years) and in space (i.e. geographically). The price of
electricity from the grid varies widely from high-cost areas such as
Hawaii and California, to lower-cost areas such as Wyoming and
Idaho.^[[41]](#cite_note-41)^ In areas with time-of-day pricing, rates
vary over the course of the day, rising during high-demand hours (e.g.
11 AM–8 PM) and declining during low-demand hours.

In some areas wind power, [landfill
gas](/wiki/Landfill_gas "Landfill gas") and biomass generation are
already lower-cost than grid electricity. Parity has already been
achieved in areas that use feed-in tariffs. For example, generation cost
from landfill gas systems in Germany are currently lower than the
average electricity spot market price)^[[42]](#cite_note-42)^ In remote
areas, electricity from solar photovoltaics can be cheaper than building
new distribution lines to connect to the transmission grid.

Policy alternatives and complements[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Policy alternatives and complements")]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Renewable Portfolio
Standards](/wiki/Renewable_Portfolio_Standard "Renewable Portfolio Standard")
(RPS) and subsidies create protected markets for renewable energy. RPS
require utilities to obtain a minimum percentage of their energy from
renewable sources. In some states, utilities can purchase [Renewable
Energy
Certificates](/wiki/Renewable_Energy_Certificate_(United_States) "Renewable Energy Certificate (United States)")
(USA), [Renewable Energy Certificate
System](/wiki/Renewable_Energy_Certificate_System "Renewable Energy Certificate System")
(EU), [Renewable Energy Certificates
Registry](/wiki/Renewable_Energy_Certificates_Registry "Renewable Energy Certificates Registry")
(AUS) to meet this requirement. These certificates are issued to
renewable energy producers based on the amount of energy they feed into
the grid. Selling the certificates is another way for the renewable
producer to supplement its revenues.^[[43]](#cite_note-43)^

Certificate prices fluctuate based on overall energy demand and
competition among renewable producers. If the amount of renewable energy
produced exceeds the required amount, certificate prices may crash, as
happened with carbon trading in Europe. This can damage the economic
viability of the renewable producers.^[[44]](#cite_note-44)^

Quota systems favor large, vertically integrated generators and
multinational electric utilities, if only because certificates are
generally denominated in units of one megawatt-hour. They are also more
difficult to design and implement than an
FIT.^[[45]](#cite_note-wind-works.org-45)^

Feed-in tariff laws were in place in 46 jurisdictions globally by
2007.^[[46]](#cite_note-46)^ Information about solar tariffs may be
found in a consolidated form, however not all of the countries are
listed in this source.^[[47]](#cite_note-47)^

### Algeria[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Algeria")]

To cover the additional costs of producing electricity from renewables
and for the costs of diversification, producers of electricity from
renewables receive a bonus for each kWh produced, marketed or
consumed.^[*[clarification\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")*]^
For electricity generated from solar or radiant heat only, the bonus is
300% of the price per kWh of electricity produced by the market operator
defined by Law 02-01 of 22 Dhu El Kaada 1422 corresponding to 5 February
2002 until the minimum contribution of solar energy represents 25% of
all primary energy. For electricity generated from facilities using
solar thermal systems solar-gas hybrid, the bonus is 200% of the price
per kWh.

For contributions of solar energy below 25%, said the bonus is paid in
the following conditions:

  Solar Share   Bonus
  ------------- -------
  \>25%         200%
  20% to 25%    180%
  15% to 20%    160%
  10% to 15%    140%
  5% to 10%     100%
  0 to 5%       0

The price of electricity is fixed by the CREG (Gas and Electricity
Regulatory Commission). According to the last decision which fixed it,
the consumer pays his electricity as below:

-   1.77 DZD/kWh for a consumption which is lower than 41.6 kWh/month.
-   4.17 DZD/kWh for a consumption which is higher than 41.6 kWh/month.

The other consumers (industry, agriculture...etc.), they pay 4.17
DZD/kWh.

The feed-in tariff provides bonuses for electricity generated by
cogeneration of 160%, taking into account thermal energy use of 20% of
all primary energy used. The bonuses for solar generated electricity and
cogeneration are cumulative. Remuneration of the generated electricity
is guaranteed over the whole plant lifetime.

Australia](/wiki/Feed-in_tariffs_in_Australia "Feed-in tariffs in Australia")

Feed-in tariffs were introduced in 2008 in [South
Australia](/wiki/South_Australia "South Australia") and
[Queensland](/wiki/Queensland "Queensland"), 2009 in the [Australian
Capital
Territory](/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory "Australian Capital Territory")
and [Victoria](/wiki/Victoria_(Australia) "Victoria (Australia)") and
2010 in [New South Wales](/wiki/New_South_Wales "New South Wales"),
[Tasmania](/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") and [Western
Australia](/wiki/Western_Australia "Western Australia"). The [Northern
Territory](/wiki/Northern_Territory "Northern Territory") offers only
local feed-in tariff schemes. A uniform federal scheme to supersede all
State schemes was proposed by Tasmanian Greens Senator [Christine
Milne](/wiki/Christine_Milne "Christine Milne"), but not
enacted.^[[48]](#cite_note-48)^ By mid-2011, FiT in NSW and ACT had been
closed to new generators, as the installed capacity cap had been
reached. In NSW, both the FiT and the cap were cut, due to the overly
generous original settings.^[[49]](#cite_note-49)^ The new conservative
Victorian government replaced the original FiT with a less generous
transitional FiT of 25 cents per kilowatt-hour for any power generated
excess to the generator's usage, pending the outcome of an inquiry by
the Victorian Competition and Efficiency Commission. This does not meet
the normal definition and has been referred to as a "fake feed-in
tariff". It is actually net metering with a payment for any kilowatt
credit, instead of the normal roll over.^[[50]](#cite_note-50)^

[Ontario](/wiki/Ontario "Ontario") introduced a feed-in tariff in 2006,
revised in 2009^[[51]](#cite_note-51)^ and 2010, increasing from 42¢/kWh
to 80.2¢/kWh for micro-scale (≤10 kW) grid-tied photovoltaic
projects,^[[52]](#cite_note-52)^^[[53]](#cite_note-Transatlantic_Climate_Policy_Group-53)^
and decreasing to 64.2¢/kWh for applications received after 2 July 2010.
Applications received prior to then had until 31 May 2011 to install the
system to receive the higher rate.^[[54]](#cite_note-54)^ Ontario's FiT
program includes a tariff schedule for larger projects up to and
including 10MW solar farms at a reduced rate. As of April 2010, several
hundred projects have been approved, including 184 large scale projects,
worth $8 billion.^[[55]](#cite_note-55)^ By April 2012, 12,000 systems
had been installed and the rate decreased to 54.9¢/kWh, for applications
received after 1 September 2011.^[[56]](#cite_note-56)^

### China[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: China")]

As of August 2011 a national solar tariff was issued at about US$0.15
per kWh.^[[57]](#cite_note-57)^

China set a tariff for new onshore wind power plants in a move to help
struggling project operators to realise profits. The National
Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the country's economic
planning agency, announced four categories of onshore wind projects,
which according to region will be able to apply for the tariffs. Areas
with better wind resources will have lower tariffs, while those with
lower outputs will be able to access more generous tariffs.

The tariffs are set at 0.51 yuan (US 0.075, GBP 0.05), 0.54 yuan, 0.58
yuan and 0.61 yuan. These represent a significant premium on the average
rate of 0.34 yuan per kilowatt-hour paid to coal-fired electricity
generators.^[[58]](#cite_note-58)^

### Czech Republic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Czech Republic")]

[Czech Republic](/wiki/Czech_Republic "Czech Republic") introduced a
tariff with law no. 180/2005 in 2005.^[[59]](#cite_note-59)^ The tariff
is guaranted for 15–30 years (depending on source). Supported sources
are small hydropower (up to 10 MW), biomass, biogas, wind and
photovoltaics. As of
2010^[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit)^
the highest tariff is 12.25 [CZK](/wiki/CZK "CZK")/kWh for small
photovoltaic.^[[60]](#cite_note-60)^ In 2010 over 1200 MW of
photovoltaics were installed, but at the end of the year the FiT was
eliminated for larger systems, and reduced by 50% for smaller systems.
In 2011, no photovoltaic systems were installed.^[[61]](#cite_note-61)^

### France[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: France")]

The administrative procedure for ground-mounted PV systems was
significantly modified in late 2009. The distinction between segments
was essentially based on capacity, which determines the complexity of
the administrative process. From 4 March to 30 September 2011, the
tariff was attractive for installations only less than 100 kWp in size.
Above 100 kWp, the FiT was 0,117 €/kWh, cutting into profits. A call for
tenders for PV projects above 250 kWp was launched on 15 September 2011.
The projects were to be analysed on multiple criteria, including the
tariff rate requested by the applicant.

On 19 April 2012 the FiT for small systems was reduced to €0.1079 for
ground mounted systems, and to €0.1934 for residential rooftop
arrays.^[[62]](#cite_note-62)^

### Germany[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Germany")]

Main article: [Feed-in tariffs in
Germany](/wiki/Feed-in_tariffs_in_Germany "Feed-in tariffs in Germany")

First introduced in 2000, the
[Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz](/wiki/Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz "Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz")
(EEG) law is reviewed on a regular basis. Its predecessor was the 1991
"Stromeinspeisegesetz". As of May 2008, the cost of the program added
about €1.01 (USD1.69) to each monthly residential electric
bill.^[[63]](#cite_note-63)^ In 2012 the costs have risen to
€0.03592/kWh.^[[64]](#cite_note-64)^

Tariff rates for PV electricity vary depending on system size and
location. In 2009, tariffs were raised for electricity immediately
consumed rather than supplied to the grid with increasing returns if
more than 30% of overall production is consumed on-site. This is to
incentivise demand-side management and help develop solutions to the
intermittency of solar power.^[[65]](#cite_note-65)^ Tariff duration is
usually 20 calendar years plus the year of installation. Systems receive
the tariff in effect at the time of installation for the entire period.

### India[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: India")]

India inaugurated its latest solar power program to date on 9 January
2010. The [Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar
Mission](/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru_National_Solar_Mission "Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission")
(JNNSM) was officially announced by Prime Minister of India on 12
January 2010.^[[69]](#cite_note-69)^ This program aimed to install
20,000 MW of solar power by 2022. The first phase of this program
targeted 1000 MW, by paying a tariff fixed by the Central Electricity
Regulatory Commission
[(CERC)](/wiki/Central_Electricity_Regulatory_Commission "Central Electricity Regulatory Commission")
of India. While in spirit this is a feed in tariff, several conditions
affect project size and commissioning date. Th tariff for solar PV
projects is fixed at Rs. 17.90 (USD 0.397)/kWh. Tariff for solar thermal
projects is fixed Rs. 15.40 (USD 0.342/kWh). Tariff will be reviewed
periodically by the CERC.

### Indonesia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Indonesia")]

The Indonesian government, operating mainly through the [State
Electricity
Corporation](/wiki/Perusahaan_Listrik_Negara "Perusahaan Listrik Negara")
(*Perusahaan Listrik Negara, or PLN*), encouraged independent power
producers (IPPs) to invest in the electric power sector. Numerous IPPs
are investing in large plants (over 500 MW) and many smaller plants
(such as 200 MW and smaller). To support this investment, FiT
arrangements are agreed with the PLN. Prices vary widely from relatively
low prices for large coal-based plants such as the [Cirebon coal
plant](/wiki/Cirebon_Steam_Power_Plant "Cirebon Steam Power Plant")
which began operations in late 2012 to higher prices for smaller
geothermal plants producing more expensive power from distant locations
such as the [Wayang
Windu](/wiki/Wayang_Windu_Geothermal_Power_Station "Wayang Windu Geothermal Power Station")
geothermal plant in [West Java](/wiki/West_Java "West Java").

### Iran[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Iran")]

[سانا](/w/index.php?title=%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A7&action=edit&redlink=1 "سانا (page does not exist)")
(SANA), first introduced FiT in 2008 for purchasing renewable energy
from investors. A price of 1300
[Rials](/wiki/Iranian_Rial "Iranian Rial")/kWh was set for renewable
electricity. For 4 night-time hours, the price is 900 Rials.

### Ireland[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Ireland")]

From 2006 to 2011 the Communications Energy and Natural Resources at
various times announced plans for FiTs. However, they never followed
through. This has seriously hindered the growth of renewable electricity
in Ireland. As of
mid-2011^[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit)^
REFIT (a Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff) was under negotiation between
[DCENR](/wiki/Department_of_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources "Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources")
and the EU. Industry associations (such as the Irish BioEnergy
Association) lobbied in favor.^[[70]](#cite_note-70)^

### Israel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Israel")]

See also: [Solar power in
Israel](/wiki/Solar_power_in_Israel "Solar power in Israel")

On 2 June 2008, the Israeli Public Utility Authority approved a *feed-in
tariff* for solar plants. The [tariff](/wiki/Tariff "Tariff") is limited
to a total installation of 50MW during 7 years, whichever is reached
first, with a maximum of 15 kWp installation for
[residential](/wiki/Residential "Residential") and a maximum of 50kWp
for [commercial](/wiki/Commerce "Commerce").^[[71]](#cite_note-71)^
[Bank Hapoalim](/wiki/Bank_Hapoalim "Bank Hapoalim") offered 10 year
loans for the installation of solar panels.^[[72]](#cite_note-72)^ The
National Infrastructures Ministry announced that it would expand the
*feed-in tariff* scheme to include medium-sized solar-power stations
ranging from 50 [kilowatts](/wiki/Kilowatts#Kilowatt "Kilowatts") to 5
[megawatts](/wiki/Megawatt "Megawatt"). The new
[tariff](/wiki/Tariff "Tariff") scheme caused solar company [Sunday
Solar
Energy](/w/index.php?title=Sunday_Solar_Energy&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sunday Solar Energy (page does not exist)")
to announce that it would invest $133 million to install [photovoltaic
solar
arrays](/wiki/Photovoltaic_solar_arrays "Photovoltaic solar arrays") on
[kibbutzim](/wiki/Kibbutzim "Kibbutzim"), which are social communities
that divide revenues amongst their
members.^[[73]](#cite_note-Sunday-73)^

### Italy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Italy")]

Italy introduced a feed-in tariff in February 2007. By 2011 Italy
installed 7128 MW,^[[74]](#cite_note-74)^ behind only Germany (7500
MW),^[[75]](#cite_note-75)^ and reduced the FiT.^[[76]](#cite_note-76)^

### Japan[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Japan")]

An FiT of ¥42 (US$0.525) per kWh for 10 years for systems less than 10
kW, and ¥40 (US$0.50) for larger systems, but for 20 years, began on 1
July 2012. The rate was to be reviewed annually, for subsequently
connected systems.^[[77]](#cite_note-77)^

### The Netherlands[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: The Netherlands")]

As of
2013^[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit)^
The Netherlands had no
FiT.^[*[citation\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^
However, the Dutch Cabinet agreed on 27 March 2009 to implement some
parts of a feed-in tariff in response to the global financial
crisis.^[[78]](#cite_note-78)^ The proposed regulation may adjust the
quota incentive system. As of the summer of 2009, The Netherlands
operated a subsidy system. The subsidy budget has a quota for diverse
types of energy, at several tens of million euros. The wind budget for
wind was hardly used, because the tariffs are too low. The 2009 budget
for Wind on Land was 900 MW (incl unused 400 MW from 2008); only 2.5 MW
was used. Dutch utilities have no obligation to buy energy from
windparks. The tariffs change yearly. This created uncertain investment
conditions. The subsidy system was introduced in 2008. The previous
subsidy scheme stopped in 2005 because it was seen as too expensive. In
2009, Dutch windparks were still being built with grants from the old
scheme. The old and new subsidy scheme was funded from the general
budget.

A feed-in tariff was briefly adopted in 2011, but ended a month later,
in February.

### South Africa[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: South Africa")]

South Africa's National Energy Regulator (NERSA) announced 31 March 2009
a system of feed-in tariffs designed to produce 10 tw-h of electricity
per year by 2013. The tariffs were substantially higher than those in
NERSA's original proposal. The tariffs, differentiated by technology,
were to be paid for 20 years.

NERSA said in its release that the tariffs were based on the cost of
generation plus a reasonable profit. The tariffs for wind energy and
concentrating solar power were among the most attractive worldwide.

The tariff for wind energy, 1.25 ZAR/kWh (€0.104/kWh) was greater than
that offered in Germany and more than proposed in Ontario, Canada.

The tariff for concentrating solar, 2.10 ZAR/kWh, was less than that in
Spain. NERSA's revised program followed extensive public consultation.

Stefan Gsänger, Secretary General of the World Wind Energy Association
said, "South Africa is the first African country to introduce a feed-in
tariff for wind energy. Many small and big investors will now be able to
contribute to the take-off of the wind industry in the country. Such
decentralised investment will enable South Africa to overcome its
current energy crisis. It will also help many South African communities
to invest in wind farms and generate electricity, new jobs and new
income. We are especially pleased as this decision comes shortly after
the first North American feed-in law has been proposed by the Government
of the Canadian Province of Ontario".^[[79]](#cite_note-79)^

However, the tariff was abandoned before it began in favor of a
competitive bidding process launched on 3 August 2011. Under this
bidding process, the South African government planned to procure 3,750MW
of renewable energy: 1,850MW of onshore wind, 1,450MW of solar PV, 200MW
of CSP, 75MW of small hydro, 25MW of landfill gas, 12.5MW of biogas,
12.5MW of biomass and 100MW of small projects. The bidding process
comprised two steps:

-   Qualification phase. Projects are assessed based on structure of the
    project, legal, land acquisition and use, financial, environmental
    consent, technical, economic development and bid guarantee
-   Evaluation phase. Compliant bids are then evaluated based on: (1)
    price relative to a ceiling provided in bid documentation,
    accounting for 70% of the decision, and (2) economic development,
    accounting for 30% of the decision.

The first round of bids was due on 4 November 2011. PPA's were expected
to be in place by June 2012. Projects should be commissioned by June
2014, except CSP projects expected by June 2015.

### Spain[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Spain")]

Spanish feed-in legislation was set by Royal decree 1578/2008 (*Real
Decreto 1578/2008*), for photovoltaic installations, and Royal decree
661/2007 for other renewable technologies injecting electricity to the
public grid. Originally under the 661/2007, photovoltaic tariffs were
developed under a separate law due to its rapid growth.

The decree 1578/2008 categorized installations in two main groups with
differentiated tariffs:

1.  Building Integrated installations; with 34c€/kWh in systems up to 20
    kW of nominal power, and for systems above 20 kW with a limit of
    nominal power of 2MW tariff of 31c€/kWh
2.  Non integrated installations; 32c€/kWh for systems up to 10MW of
    nominal power.

For other technologies decree 661/2007 setd up:

  Energy Source                             Feed-in Tariff
  ----------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Cogeneration systems                      maximum FiT of 13.29c€/kWh during lifetime of system.
  Solar thermoelectric                      26.94 c€/kWh for the first 25 years
  Wind systems                              up to 7.32 c€/kWh for the first 20 years
  Geothermal, wave, tidal and sea-thermal   6.89 c€/kWh for the first 20 years
  Hydroelectric                             7.8 c€/kWh for the first 25 years
  Biomass and biogas                        up to 13.06 c€/kWh for the first 15 years
  Waste combustion                          up to 12.57 c€/kWh for the first 15 years

On 27 January 2012 the Spanish government temporarily stopped accepting
applications for projects beginning operation after January 2013.
Construction and operation of existing projects was not
affected.^[[80]](#cite_note-80)^ The country's electrical system had a
€24 [billion](/wiki/1,000,000,000 "1,000,000,000")
deficit.^[[81]](#cite_note-81)^ FiT payments did not contribute
significantly to that deficit.^[[82]](#cite_note-82)^ In 2008 the FiT
was expected to result in 400 MW of solar being installed. However, it
was so high that over 2600 MW was installed.^[[83]](#cite_note-83)^
Utilities in Spain had no way to pass on cost increases to consumers by
increasing rates, and instead accrued deficits.

### Switzerland[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Switzerland")]

Switzerland introduced the so-called "Cost-covering remuneration for
feed-in to the electricity grid (CRF)"^[[84]](#cite_note-84)^ on 1 May
2008.

CRF applies to hydropower (up to 10 megawatts), photovoltaics, wind
energy, geothermal energy, biomass and waste material from biomass and
will be applicable for 20 and 25 years, depending on the technology. The
implementation is done through the national grid operator
SWISSGRID.^[[85]](#cite_note-85)^

While high by appearance, CRF has had little effect, as the total amount
of "extra" cost to the system was capped. Since about 2009, no more
projects could be financed. About 15'000 projects awaited allocation of
monies. If all those projects were implemented, Switzerland could
mothball all its nuclear power plants, which currently supply 40% of its
power.

In 2011, after Fukushima, some local power companies, mostly owned by
villages and cantons/provinces, selectively started offering their own
tariff, thereby creating a mini-boom.

As of March 2012 the KEV-FIT for Solar PV had been lowered several times
to CHF 0.30-0.40/kWh (USD 0.33-0.44/kWh) depending on size, but was
higher than in Germany and most of the rest of the world.

### Thailand[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Thailand")]

In 2006, the Thai government enacted a tariff paid on top of utility
avoided costs, differentiated by technology type and generator size and
guaranteed for 7–10 years. Solar received the highest amount, 8 baht/kWh
(about US cents 27/kWh). Large biomass projects received the lowest at
0.3 baht/kWh (at about 1 US cent per kWh). Additional per-kWh subsidies
were provided for projects that offset diesel use in remote
areas.^[[86]](#cite_note-86)^ [Template:As of 2010
March](/w/index.php?title=Template:As_of_2010_March&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:As of 2010 March (page does not exist)")
1364 MW of private sector renewable energy was online with an additional
4104 MW in the pipeline with signed PPAs. Biomass made up the bulk of
this capacity: 1292 MW (online) and 2119 MW (PPA only). Solar
electricity was second but growing more rapidly, with 78 MW online and
signed PPAs for an additional 1759 MW.^[[87]](#cite_note-87)^

### Uganda[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Uganda")]

Uganda launched a tariff in 2011. The Uganda Electricity Transmission
Company Limited held the transmission license in the country and was
mandated by the Electricity Regulatory Authority to provide the
following FiT for small-scale projects ranging from 0.5MW to
20MW.^[[88]](#cite_note-88)^

### Ukraine[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Ukraine")]

Ukraine introduced the law 'On feed-in tariff' on 25 September 2008. The
law guaranteed grid access for renewable energy producers (small hydro
up to 10 MW, wind, biomass, photovoltaic and geothermal). The tariffs
for renewable power producers are set by the national
regulator.^[[89]](#cite_note-89)^ As of February
2013^[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit)^
the following tariffs per kWh were applied: biomass – UAH 1.3446 (EUR
0.13), wind – UAH 1.2277 (EUR 0.12), small hydro – UAH 0.8418 (EUR
0.08), solar - UAH 5.0509 (EUR 0.48). In case of significant
fluctuations of the national currency against Euro the feed-in tariff
adjusts.

### United Kingdom[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: United Kingdom")]

Main article: [Feed-in tariffs in the United
Kingdom](/wiki/Feed-in_tariffs_in_the_United_Kingdom "Feed-in tariffs in the United Kingdom")

In October 2008 the United Kingdom announced that Britain would
implement a scheme by 2010, in addition to its current renewable energy
quota scheme
([ROCS](/wiki/Renewable_Obligation_Certificates "Renewable Obligation Certificates")).
In July 2009, he presented details of the scheme, which began in early
April 2010.^[[90]](#cite_note-renewableenergyworld.com-90)^

Less than a year into the scheme, in March 2011 the new [coalition
government](/wiki/Cameron_Ministry "Cameron Ministry") announced that
support for large-scale
[photovoltaic](/wiki/Photovoltaic "Photovoltaic") installations (greater
than 50 kW) would be cut.^[[91]](#cite_note-91)^ This was in response to
European speculators lining up to establish huge solar farms in the West
Country that would have absorbed disproportionate amounts of the
fund.^[[92]](#cite_note-92)^

On 9 June 2011, DECC^[[93]](#cite_note-93)^ confirmed tariff cuts for
solar PV systems above 50 KW after 1 August 2011.^[[94]](#cite_note-94)^
Many^[[95]](#cite_note-95)^ are disappointed with DECC's
decision.^[[96]](#cite_note-96)^ published by
PVinsights.^[[97]](#cite_note-97)^ It was believed that the total
subsidies for solar PV industry were unchanged, but that tariffs for
large systems would be cut to benefit smaller systems. The fast track
review was based on the long term plan to reach an annual installation
of 1.9GW in 2020.^[[98]](#cite_note-98)^ In October 2011 DECC announced
dramatic cuts of around 55% to tariff rates, with additional reductions
for community or group schemes. The cuts were to be effective from 12
December 2011, with a consultation exercise to end on 23 December 2011.
This was successfully challenged in the high court by an application for
judicial review, jointly made by environmental pressure group [Friends
of the Earth](/wiki/Friends_of_the_Earth "Friends of the Earth") (FoE)
and two solar companies -
[Solarcentury](/w/index.php?title=Solarcentury&action=edit&redlink=1 "Solarcentury (page does not exist)")
and HomeSun. The judgment, made by Mr Justice Mitting after a two-day
court hearing, was hailed as a major victory by green campaigners and
the solar industry. Lawyers for the Department of Energy and Climate
Change immediately moved to appeal the ruling. The appeal was
unanimously rejected by the Supreme Court, allowing anyone who installed
their systems before 3 March 2012 to receive the higher rate of 43.3
p/kWh.^[[99]](#cite_note-99)^

The 30.7 p/kWh rate was available for solar systems up to 5 MW, and
consequently no larger systems were built.^[[100]](#cite_note-100)^

1,057.344 MW.^[[102]](#cite_note-102)^ Payments are for 25 years. A
typical photovoltaic system costing £7,500 pays for itself in 7 years 8
months, and generates £23,610 over 25 years.^[[103]](#cite_note-103)^

### United States[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: United States")]

Further information: [Renewable energy in the United
States](/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_the_United_States "Renewable energy in the United States")

In April 2009, 11 [state
legislatures](/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States) "State legislature (United States)")
were considering adopting a FiT as a complement to their renewable
electricity
mandates.^[[53]](#cite_note-Transatlantic_Climate_Policy_Group-53)^

#### California[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=35 "Edit section: California")]

The [California Public Utilities
Commission](/wiki/California_Public_Utilities_Commission "California Public Utilities Commission")
(CPUC) approved a feed-in tariff on 31 January 2008 effective
immediately.^[[104]](#cite_note-104)^

In 2010, Marin Energy Authority launched the first Community Choice
Aggregate Feed-in Tariff program. The program was updated in November
2012, and now offers 20-year fixed-price contracts, with prices varying
by energy source (peak, base-load, intermittent) and progress towards
the current program cap of 10-MW.

Municipal utility companies enacted feed in tariff pilot programs in
Palo Alto and Los Angeles: Palo Alto CLEAN (Clean Local Energy
Accessible Now) is a program to purchase up to 4MW of electricity
generated by solar electric systems located in CPAU's service territory.
In 2012 the minimum project size was 100 kW. Rates of purchase are
between 12.360 ¢/kWh to 14.003 ¢/kWh depending on the length of the
contract. The City began accepting applications on 2 April
2012.^[[105]](#cite_note-105)^

On 17 April 2012, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's Board of
Water and Power Commissioners approved a 10MW FiT Demonstration
Program.^[[106]](#cite_note-106)^

As of 1 January 2010 state laws allowed homeowners to sell excess power
to the utility. Previously the homeowner would get no credit for
over-production over the course of the year. In order to get the
[California Solar
Initiative](/wiki/California_Solar_Initiative "California Solar Initiative")
(CSI) rebate the customer was not allowed to install a system that
deliberately over-produces thereby, encouraging efficiency measures to
be installed after solar installation. This over-production credit was
not available to certain municipal utility customers namely Los Angeles
Water and Power.

#### Florida[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Florida")]

In February 2009, city commissioners in
[Gainesville](/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida "Gainesville, Florida"),
Florida, approved the nation's first solar feed-in
tariff.^[[53]](#cite_note-Transatlantic_Climate_Policy_Group-53)^ The
program was capped at 4 MW per year. As of 2011, Gainesville had
increased solar generated electricity from 328 kW to 7,391 kW,
approximately 1.2% of peak load energy (610
MW).^[[107]](#cite_note-107)^

#### Hawaii[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Hawaii")]

In September 2009 the [Hawaii Public Utilities
Commission](/wiki/Hawaii_Public_Utilities_Commission "Hawaii Public Utilities Commission")
required [Hawaiian Electric
Company](/wiki/Hawaiian_Electric_Company "Hawaiian Electric Company")
(HECO & MECO & HELCO) to pay above-market prices for renewable energy
fed into the electric grid. The policy offers projects a set price and
standard 20-year contract. The PUC planned to review the initial feed-in
tariff two years after the program started and every three years
thereafter.

Project size was limited to five megawatts (MW) for the island of
ʻ[Oahu](/wiki/Oahu "Oahu") and 2.72 MW for [Maui](/wiki/Maui "Maui") and
[Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii_(island) "Hawaii (island)") island. The
Commission's decision capped the total amount of feed-in tariff projects
brought onto the electricity grid at 5% of the system peak on Oahu,
Maui, and Hawaii Island for the first two years. Tier 3 was still
pending a Decision and Order based on the findings of the Reliability
Standards Working Group (a "docket within the docket").

Tier 2 and 3 project size caps varied by island and by technology. Tier
2 includes larger systems that are less than or equal to: 100 kW-AC for
on-shore wind and in-line hydropower on all islands; 100 kW-AC for PV
and CSP on Lanai and Molokai; 250 kW-AC for PV on Maui and Hawaii; 500
kW-AC for CSP on Maui and Hawaii; and 500 kW-AC for PV and CSP on Oahu.
Tier 3 covers systems larger than the Tier 2
caps.^[[108]](#cite_note-108)^

#### Maine[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=38 "Edit section: Maine")]

In 2009 a "Feed-In" Tariff bill failed to
pass.^[[109]](#cite_note-109)^^[[110]](#cite_note-110)^ In June 2009 a
pilot program was initiated however, and was available for projects up
to 10MW in size.^[[111]](#cite_note-111)^ On April 24, 2013, the Maine
Utility and Energy Committee was to consider a new bill: LD1085 "An Act
to Establish the Renewable Energy Feed-in
Tariff".^[[112]](#cite_note-112)^

#### New York[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=39 "Edit section: New York")]

The [Long Island Power
Authority](/wiki/Long_Island_Power_Authority "Long Island Power Authority")
(LIPA) adopted a feed-in tariff on 16 July 2012, for systems from 50 kW
(AC) to 20 MW (AC), and was limited to 50 MW (AC). As customers cannot
use their own electricity, it is actually a 20 year fixed rate power
purchase agreement and LIPA retains the SRECs. The 2012 NY legislature
failed to pass legislation which would have opened a New York market for
SRECs starting in 2013.^[[113]](#cite_note-113)^ Payment is
22.5¢/kWh,^[[114]](#cite_note-114)^ less than what LIPA paid for peak
generation at various times.^[[115]](#cite_note-115)^ At an estimated
avoided cost of $0.075/kWh, the program added about $0.44/month to the
average household electric bill.^[[116]](#cite_note-116)^

#### Oregon[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=40 "Edit section: Oregon")]

In June 2009, Oregon established a pilot solar volumetric incentive rate
and payment program. Under this incentive program, systems are paid for
the kilowatt-hours (kWh) generated over a 15-year period, at a rate set
at the time a system is enrolled in the program. The Oregon Public
Utility Commission (PUC) established rates and rules in May 2010. This
program was offered by the three investor-owned utilities in Oregon and
administered by the utilities. The PUC planned to periodically
re-evaluate rates. Program costs were recoverable in utility rates and
utility-owned systems were not eligible for the incentive.

The pilot program installation cap was limited to an aggregate cap of 25
megawatts (MW) of solar photovoltaics (PV), with a maximum system size
cap of 500 kilowatts (kW). The aggregate program cap was to be spread
equally over four years, with 6.25 MW of capacity being eligible to
receive the incentive each year. The aggregate cap was divided, based on
2008 retail sales revenue. PGE had a cap of 14.9 MW, Pacific Power 9.8
MW, and Idaho Power 0.4 MW. Idaho Power's program was limited to
residential installations. Rates differed by system size and geographic
zone. Small- and medium-scale systems participated in a program modeled
after net metering. Larger-scale systems were competitivelly bid.
Participating PV systems must be grid-connected, metered and meet all
applicable codes and regulations. Systems must be "permanently
installed".

Systems sized 100 kW or less could participate based on net metering.
Generating capacity of 20 MW of the aggregate cap was reserved for the
net metering portion, with 12 MW available for residential and 8 MW
available for small commercial systems. These residential and small
commercial systems were paid for the amount of electricity generated, up
to the amount of electricity consumed. In essence, customers were paid
for the amount of utility electric load consumption that is offset by
onsite generation. Unlike typical feed-in tariffs, customers can consume
the electricity generated on-site and receive a production incentive –
or a volumetric incentive payment – for the amount of electricity
generated and consumed. To remove a [perverse
incentive](/wiki/Perverse_incentive "Perverse incentive") to increase
electricity consumption to receive a greater payment, the system had to
be appropriately sized to meet average electricity consumption. Rates
were determined by the PUC based on annual system cost and annual energy
output, differentiated by geographic zones. The cost estimates were
based on installation data from [Energy Trust of
Oregon](/wiki/Energy_Trust_of_Oregon "Energy Trust of Oregon"). The
actual rates paid to the customer-generator were the volumetric
incentive rate minus the retail rate. The volumetric incentive rates
were to be re-evaluated every six months. The rates for the
performance-based incentive program ranged from $0.25/kWh to
$0.411/kWh.^[[117]](#cite_note-117)^

#### Vermont[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=41 "Edit section: Vermont")]

Vermont adopted feed-in tariffs on 27 May 2009 as part of the Vermont
Energy Act of 2009. Generators must possess a capacity of no more than
2.2 MW, and participation is limited to 50 MW in 2012, a limit that
increased by 5 to 10 MW/year to a total of 127.5 MW in
2022.^[[118]](#cite_note-118)^ Payments were 24¢/kWh for solar, which
was increased to 27.1¢/kWh in March 2012, and 11.8¢/kWh for wind over
100 kW and 25.3¢/kWh for wind turbines up to 100 kW. Other qualifying
technologies included methane, hydro and
biomass.^[[119]](#cite_note-119)^ Vermont's SPEED program called for 20%
renewable energy by 2017 and 75% by 2032. The program was fully
subscribed in 2012. Payments are for 25 years.^[[120]](#cite_note-120)^

### Puerto Rico[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Feed-in_tariff&action=edit&section=42 "Edit section: Puerto Rico")]

The territory operated a net metering program that paid the energy fed
back to the grid at the retail rate. The rate varied monthly around 23
cents per kilowatt. The program credited the provider's account each
month rather than making actual payments. At the end of the fiscal year
(June) any excess was paid at a fixed 10 cents per KW of which 25% was
retained for public schools. To participate in the program insurance and
means for disconnecting the system accessible outside of the building
and specific brands of equipment dictated by the government were
required.
