In Praise of Efficient Price Gouging
====================================

Uber’s most important innovation is the way it prices its services. But
that innovation has not been unreservedly welcomed by customers. They’re
wrong.

Why It Matters
--------------

Dynamic pricing could be applied in many industries to better manage
supply and demand.

![illustration of man in waist-high snow hailing car on
lift](http://www.technologyreview.com/sites/default/files/images/review.surowieckix519.png)

\

In the four years since the car service Uber launched, it has been beset
by criticism from myriad groups, including city officials annoyed by its
sometimes cavalier attitude toward regulation and taxi companies annoyed
by increased competition. Some of the harshest criticism, though, has
come from an unlikely place: Uber’s own customers. Thanks to its
reliance on what it calls “surge pricing”— meaning that during times of
high demand, Uber raises its prices, often sharply—the company has been
accused of profiteering and exploiting its customers. When Uber jacked
up prices during a snowstorm in New York last December, for instance,
there was an eruption of complaints, the general mood being summed up by
a tweet calling Uber [“price-gouging
assholes.”](https://twitter.com/Mtbkgrl/status/418509561301962752)

**Thing reviewed**

[Uber's dynamic pricing
model](http://abovethecrowd.com/2014/03/11/a-deeper-look-at-ubers-dynamic-pricing-model/)
\
 \

What’s striking about the Uber backlash is that the company is hardly
the first to use dynamic pricing. There have always been crude forms of
price differentiation—or, as it is known in economics, price
discrimination. If you go to a movie matinee, you pay less than if you
go at night, and if you’re willing to wait to buy a new dress (and run
the risk that it might sell out), you can often get it at a marked-down
price. But dynamic pricing in a more rigorous sense was pioneered in the
1980s by Robert Crandall, CEO of American Airlines, as a way to fight
off competition from discount airlines like People Express. American
began by slashing prices for tickets bought well in advance, while
keeping prices for tickets bought closer to takeoff (when ticket
inventory was lower, and demand was less price-sensitive) as high as
possible. In the decades since, this kind of yield management has become
integral to the business models of airlines, hotels, and rental-car
companies, and greater computing power and more sophisticated data
analysis has turned pricing in these industries into an incredibly
complex process. (Dynamic pricing has also allowed sites like Priceline
and Hotwire to flourish, since when hotels are stuck with extra rooms,
they’re often willing to drop prices rather than let a room sit empty.)
More recently, as technology has made it easier to segment the market
and change prices on the fly, dynamic pricing has become common in other
industries, too. Many professional sports teams now use it to set ticket
prices—games against high-profile teams cost more than games against
cellar dwellers—while concert ticket prices wax and wane with demand.

If dynamic pricing is hardly unusual, why has Uber taken so much flak?
Some of it is a matter of history: early on, Uber’s pricing was not
especially transparent, so customers occasionally found themselves stuck
with fares that were much higher than they expected. The fact that some
of the most high-profile examples of surge pricing have been the result
of big storms also matters, since it taps into people’s visceral dislike
of price gouging. A 1986 study by Daniel Kahneman, Jack Knetsch, and
Richard Thaler found that most people thought “raising prices in
response to a shortage is unfair even when close substitutes are readily
available”—a situation that almost perfectly describes Uber. Then, too,
the price increases during surges are often magnitudes greater than
customers are used to; during that New York snowstorm, Uber charged up
to nearly eight times as much as it usually did. Thaler has suggested
that people find price increases above three times normal
psychologically ­intolerable.

> The reality is that the times when people most want a ride are also
> the times when it’s most annoying and, often, most risky to drive:
> rush hour, New Year’s Eve, 2 a.m. on a Saturday night, snowstorms.

It’s also important that Uber’s prices only rise above the base rate and
never fall below it, since customers seem to accept dynamic pricing more
easily when it’s characterized as a discount. At the movies, for
instance, prime-time tickets aren’t presented as a few dollars more than
the normal price—rather, matinees are presented as a few dollars less.
When American introduced dynamic pricing, it framed the 21-day
advance-purchase requirement as a chance to buy “super-saver” fares. And
happy hours at bars are, similarly, framed as a markdown from the
regular price. These framing devices don’t change the underlying
economics or price structure, but they can have a big impact on customer
reaction. In 1999, for instance, Douglas Ivester, then the CEO of
Coca-Cola, suggested that smart vending machines would allow Cokes to be
more expensive on hot days, when demand was presumably higher. There was
an immediate, intense backlash, and the company quickly backed down,
saying Ivester’s comments were purely hypothetical. Had Ivester instead
suggested that Coca-Cola could use dynamic pricing to charge less on
cold days (even if it had raised the base price of a can), response
would probably have been very different. Uber’s competitor Lyft seems to
have recognized the power of framing: it recently introduced what it
calls happy-hour pricing, offering discounts during slow business hours.

Finally, Uber also faces a challenge simply because of the industry it’s
in: a business in which fares have historically been regulated (for
cabs) and fixed (if you take a car service to the airport in New York,
for instance, you typically pay the same price whether you leave at 6
a.m. or 5 p.m.). Uber’s pricing scheme is more complicated and harder to
grasp intuitively, so that even though Uber is transparent about surge
pricing, some people inevitably find it vexing. Uber’s also combating
the sense that transportation is, in some sense, a public utility, and
that it’s offensive to charge people so much more than they’re used to
paying. This is a mysterious complaint, since there are many
alternatives to using Uber. But it’s a surprisingly common one.

It’s easy to see, then, why Uber has become a flash point for criticism.
But there is a deep irony here: the company arguably offers the most
economically sensible, and useful, example of dynamic pricing in today’s
economy.

In most cases, after all, dynamic pricing is a way for companies to
maximize profits by exploiting demand—charging higher prices to people
who can and will pay more. As MIT professor Yossi Sheffi has put it,
it’s the “science of squeezing every possible dollar from customers.”

That’s because most industries that use dynamic pricing have a limited
inventory (an airline flight has a set number of seats, a hotel a set
number of rooms) and are trying to make as much money from selling that
inventory as possible. Uber’s case is different. While the company also
wants to make as much money as possible, it uses surge pricing not only
to exploit demand but to increase supply.

![illustrated screen of Uber's smartphone
app](http://www.technologyreview.com/sites/default/files/images/review.surowiecki.2x235.png)

The Uber app tells users how much the rate has increased during times of
high demand.

When there are more would-be Uber passengers than available Uber cars,
the company’s algorithm sets a price that balances supply and demand.
Uber’s algorithm (which it has been refining since 2011) is the
company’s greatest asset and most significant innovation, allowing it to
find the price that will attract drivers—whom, as independent
contractors, it can’t order onto the road—without alienating customers.
The strategy works. In a recent blog
[post](http://abovethecrowd.com/2014/03/11/a-deeper-look-at-ubers-dynamic-pricing-model/),
the venture capitalist Bill Gurley, who’s an Uber board member, said
that when Uber first tested dynamic pricing in Boston in 2012, it was
able to “increase on-the-road supply of drivers by 70 to 80 percent.”

Plenty of us have an intuition that cab drivers would want to be on the
road when there’s money to be made. But this isn’t the case: a number of
studies have shown that there’s considerable variety in how they decide
when to drive. Also, the reality is that the times when people most want
a ride are also the times when it’s most annoying and, often, most risky
to drive. Rush hour, New Year’s Eve, 2 a.m. on a Saturday night,
snowstorms: generally speaking, these are exactly the times when a
driver doesn’t want to be on the road. But if driving at those times
pays considerably better, then they are more likely to be willing.

What this means is that in the case of Uber, surge pricing doesn’t just
make rides more expensive (as is the case with airline tickets or hotel
rooms at times of high demand). It also expands the number of people who
are actually able to get a ride. Customers pay more, but they also get a
ride that they otherwise would not have gotten. This is exactly how a
market is supposed to work: higher demand induces more supply.

Of course, Uber has been making this argument for a while now, and it
hasn’t stopped people from complaining. (Though it hasn’t stopped people
from using the service, either: Uber is now valued at more than $17
billion.) So pundits have proffered a number of suggestions for solving
the public relations problem.

The company itself should take no money during surge periods (it now
takes 20 percent of every fare), so all the money goes to the drivers.
Or it should cap prices to consumers but pay the higher price to
drivers, essentially subsidizing people’s rides in surge periods. Or
when prices rise really sharply, Uber should donate its take to charity.

These are all interesting ideas. But it’d be a mistake for Uber to let
public relations trump economics when it comes to dynamic pricing. It
makes sense that the company recently reached an agreement with New
York’s attorney general that caps surge pricing during times of
“emergency,” since these emergencies are rare, and the negative fallout
from them can be immense. But tinkering with the basic idea of surge
pricing will only reinforce the status quo and bolster people’s implicit
assumption that prices should be set, in some sense, independently of
supply and demand. The basic reality of Uber’s business model is that
when people want a ride the most, it’s likely to be the most expensive.
This will always be irritating, just as exorbitant prices for
last-minute airline tickets are irritating. But over time, surge pricing
will also become more familiar and less surprising.

Utilities are now starting to use dynamic pricing for electric power,
which can help prevent blackouts at times of high demand and promote
energy conservation more generally. A new startup called Boomerang
Commerce, which is led by former Amazon engineers, has been helping
online retailers set prices dynamically. Dynamic pricing is the future,
even if the road to get there will be bumpy.
