When parents find they have a two-year-old who can read, or a
five-year-old who wakes up talking about square roots, the task of
ensuring that these exceptionally bright children get the educational
nourishment they need is unchartered territory. The path can be
frustrating for the kids, and worry-inducing for the parents. But the
ongoing boom in online learning opportunities has been a great benefit
for many gifted youth because the offerings can cater to a student’s
ability rather than age.

Sating the voracious curiosity of gifted students can be challenging.
They may get bored and cranky when they easily grasp lessons ahead of
the group in a standard classroom. Take, for example, the case of a
seven-year-old who attends a Berkeley, Calif., public elementary school.
When he found the pace of his math class unbearably slow, he protested
by gluing together two months’ worth of his math worksheets. Given a new
packet of them, he “filled out all the answers, and then folded each
sheet into paper airplanes,” his mother said. (The mother asked that
they not be identified in this story.)

The educational infrastructure in the U.S. for supporting high-achieving
students is an underfunded patchwork quilt of services and programs
across the states, according to [a survey by the National Association
for Gifted
Children](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111109005205/en/Nations-Infrastructure-Support-Gifted-Students-Crumbling-Survey).

“We do not have a systematic way of addressing the needs of the gifted,”
said Joyce VanTassel-Baska, education professor emerita at the College
of William and Mary. “You could go to one school system and they might
be doing a great job. And you would go to another school system and you
would see nothing.”

As a result, gifted students and their parents often must cobble
together their [own individual education
plan](http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/Articles_ic_10680.aspx) from
various sources to obtain a deeper, more advanced intellectual dive than
what standard school systems can provide.

In the case of the young Berkeley protester, who was reading at a
fifth-grade level by age four, “we spend *a lot* of time at the library
trying to keep up with his interests and voracious reading habit,” his
mother said. At home, “we make books, build airplanes and robots out of
found objects, research stuff online, fix our bikes, and create
elaborate LEGO machines. He is endlessly curious and astonishingly
creative.” The parents have signed him up for extracurricular classes in
science as well as art, music, and sports, including classes for gifted
students at the Lawrence Hall of Science. This family has not tried
online options yet, and if they do look into private school options,
they’ll have to apply for scholarships or financial aid, or would not be
able to afford it.

“It’s very difficult to find a high school that would be willing to have
a 10-year-old take an AP course.”

Across the bay in San Francisco, Debbie Saret has been similarly engaged
in an evolving process of discovery in finding the right resources for
her exceptionally gifted son — a 13-year-old who is now doing math
coursework at the college-sophomore level. Six years ago, when she and
her husband decided to homeschool him starting in the second grade, it
was like stepping off “into the unknown” – a journey that had the
parents constantly worrying whether they were making good choices and
often “really feeling quite alone, because nobody else around us had
ever done anything like that,” she said. Her son’s education has been an
eclectic meld of private tutoring, online courses, after-school and
summer camps, [math circle](https://www.mathcircles.org), and community
college classes.

**ONLINE SOURCES BRING ACCESS TO THE WORLD**

Compared to three decades ago, many more out-of-school academic
resources are now available for gifted learners, which makes it easier
than ever to access advanced learning opportunities, ranging from [video
courses](http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2011/08/24/01edtech-gifted.h31.html)
to [diploma-granting online high
schools.](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/education/stanfords-online-high-school-raises-the-bar.html?_r=0)

“The online component was extremely important for us,” Saret said.

Math and English courses from Stanford’s [Education Program for Gifted
Youth](http://epgy.stanford.edu) (EPGY) initially formed the backbone of
the Saret son’s homeschooling. Founded in 1990, EPGY has long offered
self-paced, computer-based instruction through brief, pre-recorded
multimedia lectures on CD-ROMs or, as technology has evolved, via web
browser. Students can also sign up for tutorial guidance from an
instructor by phone, email, or the web. (Under a recent licensing deal
with Stanford, an education company named Redbird Advanced Learning has
taken over the EPGY program and is in a transition of updating and
enhancing its technology components.)

At age eight, Saret’s son began taking classes part-time at [Stanford
Online High School](https://ohs.stanford.edu/) (OHS), a fully
accredited, diploma-granting school for academically talented students
in grades 7 through 12. OHS, which opened in 2006, provides real-time,
interactive virtual seminars through web-based video conferencing.

Despite the fact that much of it happens online, Saret says there’s an
emphasis on developing personal connections, too. “They really have a
sense of community,” Saret noted. “Class meetings, clubs — it’s a very
interactive online experience with video, text chat, whiteboard. Very
much like a normal class, but online in terms of interaction.”

Saret is grateful that these sorts of learning resources exist for her
son. “Online opportunities are really a big benefit for this group of
students, because your age doesn’t matter as much as your interests and
your ability … Because it’s very difficult to, say, find a high school
that would be willing to have a 10-year-old take an AP course,” she
said. At that age, her son was able to study AP physics at OHS.

**TEACHING THE GIFTED**

Other digital learning options for the gifted include independent-study
courses from [Johns Hopkins University](http://cty.jhu.edu/ctyonline),
[Duke University](http://tip.duke.edu/node/141), and [Northwestern
University](http://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/gll/). Another resource
popular among young math prodigies around the world is the [Art of
Problem
Solving](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/School/index.php?page=howclassroomworks)
(AoPS) web community and school, which provides real-time instruction
through a virtual classroom where pupils and teachers communicate via
live text-chatting. Such online education programs offer bright kids a
lot of flexibility and a variety of ways for taking their learning well
beyond the usual school curricula. Even if standard schools offer
advanced placement classes in calculus, those offerings aren’t rigorous
enough for many of the mathematically precocious kids who come to AoPS,
said Richard Rusczyk, company founder and a winner of the USA
Mathematics Olympiad in 1989.

“They get everything right away. The problems are just too easy,” he
said. Typical AP classes don’t prepare the students for math courses at
places like MIT, he said, where they may hit the wall of failure for the
very first time – and get so discouraged that they just might quit math
or science. That would be bad, not just for the student but also
potentially for all of us, because as Rusczyk and others point out,
these exceptionally bright individuals have a lot to give. “These
students are going to produce an outsized portion of the major
technological, medical, mathematical, scientific, economic advances of
the next generation,” he said.

The philosophy at AoPS is to teach math at a deep and complex level and
introduce high-performing students to difficult problems that stretch
their capabilities early. In Rusczyk’s view, the ultimate goal of
education should be “[to teach students how to solve
problems](http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/Articles_id_10565.aspx)they’ve
never seen before. That’s the main focus of what we’re trying to do in
our classes.” The ability to work through difficult conundrums applies
to all kinds of life and career situations, such as, in his case,
figuring out how to run a company, he said.

A key part of challenging the smartest kid in a school, he added, is
exposing him or her to peers who are just as sharp or even sharper.
“I’ll tell kids, if you’re always the smartest person in the room, you
need to find another room,” Rusczyk said.

The internet now makes it a lot simpler to find and engage with a
brainier crowd. For math lovers, AoPS is one of those “other rooms.”
While children in the top 5 percent of intellectual talent largely look
the same in a standard curriculum — all acing their classes with 100s —
in the AoPS community, students look wildly different in their
abilities, interests, and needs, Rusczyk said. Some want to be “taught
to the test” and need to be trained out of that mentality, while others
want to only think about tackling hard problems. Some turn in beautiful
writing assignments, he said, while others “will write stuff that their
English teachers would be horrified to look at — no punctuation, no
capital letters.”

When very bright children are ready for a more in-depth complexity of
material at a young age but don’t get it at their schools, they’re badly
served, said Stanford math professor Rafe Mazzeo, who served as EPGY’s
faculty director. It’s not uncommon to see gifted kids who tap out all
their high school’s math courses early and spend their entire senior
year taking humanities classes. But if those students plan to go into
any quantitative discipline, including engineering or natural sciences,
allowing their math skills to get rusty for a year or more is “kind of a
disaster,” Mazzeo said.

“If they have a couple of fallow years where they’re not being
challenged, you can really do them intellectual damage.” With its
extracurricular computer-based classes, EPGY’s mission has been to help
students race ahead with more challenging, accelerated coursework while
still staying in the social milieu of their regular grades at their
local schools.

At Stanford OHS, which grew out of EPGY’s success, students also can
race ahead, but they generally do it with a cohort of other
high-achievers who are doing the same thing. The school’s philosophy is
to place students into courses by their ability, not age or grade level,
said admissions director Claire Goldsmith. “There’s no way to max out.
We can offer courses to kids at all levels.” With 530 students from 43
states and 18 nations currently enrolled, OHS focuses on fostering
critical thinking and argumentation with its core curriculum. It also
provides counseling support for social and emotional issues.

**STUDENTS’ EXPERIENCES**

Chloe Clougher of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, started at OHS as a junior
last fall after two yea­rs at a nearby private college-preparatory high
school, and prior to that, homeschooling since kindergarten. Though she
liked her local school, she decided to apply to OHS because it offered
some advanced classes in science and Mandarin that the brick-and-mortar
school didn’t have. It would’ve been otherwise frustrating “to try to
cobble a whole random schedule together from, like, three different
schools or online courses like edX,” said the 16-year-old, who won a
full scholarship covering OHS’s expensive $17,250 yearly tuition. (About
16 percent of OHS students receive financial aid.)

Although the brick-and-mortar high school has AP courses, Clougher said,
she noticed that they kept students busy with lots of assignments that
didn’t seem like meaningful work. Now at OHS, she is currently jazzed
about biology class and her instructor, who’s not only enthusiastic
about teaching, but also about learning new areas of biological research
– and hearing what the students have to say. “You don’t really see that
in a whole lot of teachers,” Clougher said.

“They have excellent teachers and really interesting classes,” said
sophomore Eva Guevara, 15, who lives in Marfa, a town in far West Texas,
and is also attending OHS on a full scholarship. She had gone to ninth
grade at the local brick-and-mortar public high school, but found the
pace slow and uninteresting. Biology class was especially disappointing,
she said. “I ended up just being sent out of the room and just [watching
Khan
Academy](http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/05/how-are-teachers-and-students-using-khan-academy/)[videos](http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/05/how-are-teachers-and-students-using-khan-academy/)
and taking notes on those.” Today, she still goes to the local school
building, but only to attend one robotics course and use the library,
where she logs into her OHS seminars. Chemistry class, currently her
favorite, is “challenging but also it’s really fun,” Guevara said. “And
I feel like it’s going at a really great pace for me too.”

While the Stanford coursework is more rigorous and satisfying, both
Clougher and Guevara said that social interactions with their classmates
online, although quite good, naturally can’t fully match the social life
of a real-life high school. But many OHS students do get to meet
classmates face-to-face in occasional get-togethers in their region.

For gifted students, building strong friendships is as important to
their personal growth as academic achievement. In San Francisco, Saret
said that finding communities for her son and their family, and keeping
those social circles going, has been one of the biggest challenges. For
him, attending [Epsilon Camp](http://epsiloncamp.org/), a two-week
summer program for 8- to 11-year-olds who are profoundly gifted at math,
was life-changing: At the camp held in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in
2011, he met kindred spirits sharing an intense passion for math, a
community where he felt he truly belonged.

“He has said to me, ‘It was the first time that I felt that other kids
understood what I was trying to say in the most truthful sense.’ He
could just be himself, say whatever he wanted to say, without worrying
about the other kids not getting him,” said Saret, who subsequently
became Epsilon Camp’s admissions director. Her son still keeps in touch
with the close friends he made there, including some who live in the Bay
Area.

        My kids love Online G3 too. The classes are excellent and the

        Online G3 is the gold standard for homeschooling HG+ kids,
        IM(and most of my homeschooling friends)O. It should definitely
        be on any comprehensive list of online gifted resources. My

        considers G3 his home base.

    Thanks so much, Ms. Chen, for an inspirational and informative
    article, not to mention a good read. And thanks to all the parents
    who agreed to share their stories with the rest of us. I am the
    parent of an exceptionally gifted child who is struggling in his
    current school with what is probably uninteresting work (or maybe
    it’s that he hates writing), while simultaneously working five years
    ahead of grade level in an online course (EPGY algebra, as it
    happens). It is comforting to know that our experience–especially
    the challenges and frustrations–is not unique, and it’s encouraging
    to hear that we might find a way through what feels like an
    overwhelming mess at the moment.

    Our family has benefited so much from onlineg3. My two gifted kids
    have different personalities and learning styles, and both have
    loved the class format and especially Headmistress Guinevere

    my older child is still in contact with former classmates. G3 is
    also expanding offerings and opportunities for kids to connect —
    makes me sad my younger is going back to school! But my older can’t

    My 2e son has taken a couple of classes with
    [http://giftedhomeschoolers.org/ghf-online/](http://giftedhomeschoolers.org/ghf-online/)
    and they have been top-notch. The instructors are incredibly
    accommodating of the twice-exceptionalities and he thrived in both
    classes. The classes offered have always been interesting, with a
    fun twist that captures the students’ attention and he’s already
    looking forward to the classes he’s taking there next fall. Cannot
    recommend GHFO highly enough.

-   Ted Rosell

    My son took a class through
    [http://giftedhomeschoolers.org](http://giftedhomeschoolers.org)
    that actually got him to \*write\* for the first time in years. It
    was thrilling. He also did a class with AoPS that he struggled with
    a bit more, but that was definitely better than his school math
    experience had been, and a lot easier on me than trying to help him
    myself.

    One of the things that’s been best for my son about online classes
    is that the problems he had with peers (bullying) don’t exist–and
    not dealing with the unfortunate fact of the current underfunded
    public school system, where one teacher is expected to keep 30 or
    more students on schedule moving through the material at the same
    pace. Which is a killer for kids who have lots of questions and who
    want to make connections and insights about the material, as much as
    it is for the kids who can’t keep up.

    athenasacademy.com has proven to be a great online educational
    resource for my program. I have home-educated my six children for

    recommend the classes there for students who are looking for
    superior teaching and education.

    We are great fans of Athena’s Academy. Our 9 year old son has done 2

    Thank you for such a thoughtful article. There is not a wide
    understanding of the needs of gifted children for having a
    challenging education, and you highlighted that well. Parents of
    typical children do not want to hear that another child is too smart
    for school or bored, when their child is struggling or working
    appropriately. I would hope that this article reaches some of them
    so they have a broader understanding of what other families face. We
    have a gifted daughter, and had to opt out of the traditional
    age-based classroom in favor if homeschooling because she never did
    well in that traditional environment and was extremely frustrated
    and unhappy. I am a bit cynical about the plugs, uh comments, that
    many folks seem to have left here which smack of “Don’t forget about
    us!” endorsements of other programs than the ones you featured,
    rather than broader reflections of personal experience with gifted
    online education. But nonetheless, there are many online course
    offerings which were not mentioned in the article, and some are
    specifically geared towards gifted students. We have been grateful
    to have these options, and have used several programs, some you
    mentioned and some you did not. EPGY (we liked for math, and that
    the student was able to advance quickly through material he
    understood), Thinkwell (good lectures in math, but seem to have to
    move through at their pace, not the student’s), PLATO (for science–
    thorough, but not particularly hands on), CTY (both for courses they
    affiliated with and those they developed– great instructor
    communication, feedback and support), and Gifted Homeschoolers’
    Forum (live class — high marks for the Greek and World mythology
    class for great instructor interaction and high level in-depth
    discussions and analysis of challenging material, but there was no
    writing component). There is no one-size-fits-all homeschooling
    option for gifted kids any more than there is a traditional
    environment which works for all, but we really appreciate having the
    options and the choices to challenge our daughter with material and
    a learning environment that is more adapted to her needs.

Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck’s work on growth mindsets has
dominated much of the attention around how students can influence their
own learning. But there are other ways to help students tap into their
own motivation, too. Here are a few other important mindsets to
consider.
