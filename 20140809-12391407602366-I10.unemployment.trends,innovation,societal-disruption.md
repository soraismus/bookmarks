Innovation is supposed to be the cure for economic doldrums. But what if
it’s the cause? More specifically: Is it possible that the
ever-increasing automation of everything from factories to retail sales
to journalism will destroy more jobs than it creates?

[![Will Oremus](/content/dam/slate/Authors/will_oremus-authorbio.png)
Will Oremus](http://www.slate.com/authors.will_oremus.html)

Will Oremus is ***Slate***'s senior technology writer.

It’s a question that economists and workers have been asking since at
least the Industrial Revolution. And in the past, the answer has
generally been a straightforward “no.” Automation makes certain
low-skill human jobs obsolete, sure, but it also ushers in new
categories of high-skill employment, from engineering and equipment
operation to banking and blogging. Its greatest effect is to increase
productivity, which should raise incomes and stimulate demand for new
products and services.

Yet the current jobless recovery, along with a longer-term trend toward
income and wealth inequality, has some thinkers wondering whether the
latest wave of automation is different from those that preceded it.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers Andrew McAfee and Erik
Brynjolfsson, among others, see a “[great
decoupling](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/opinion/global/jobs-productivity-and-the-great-decoupling.html)”
of productivity from wages since about 2000 as technology outpaces human
workers’ education and skills. Workers, in other words, are losing [the
race between education and
technology](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674035305/?tag=slatmaga-20). This
may be exacerbating a longer-term trend in which [capital has gained the
upper hand on
labor](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117429/capital-twenty-first-century-thomas-piketty-reviewed)
since the 1970s.

Replacing manual labor with machines on farms and in factories was one
thing, the worriers say. Those machines were dumb and highly
specialized, requiring humans to oversee them at every stage. But the
21^st^ century is witnessing the rise of far smarter machines that can
perform tasks previously thought to be immune to automation.

Today’s software can answer your calls, organize your calendar, sell you
shoes, recommend your next movie, and target you with advertisements.
Tomorrow’s software will [diagnose your
diseases](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/robot_invasion/2011/09/will_robots_steal_your_job_3.html),
[write your news
stories](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/07/automated_insights_to_write_ap_earnings_reports_why_robots_can_t_take_journalists.html),
and even [drive your
car](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/04/28/google_self_driving_car_safety_first_with_city_streets_bicyclists_pedestrians.html).
When even high-skill “knowledge workers” are at risk of being replaced
by machines, what human jobs will be left? Politics, perhaps—and, of
course, entrepreneurship and management. The rich will get richer, in
other words, and the rest of us will be left behind.

All of which has brought John Maynard Keynes’ concept of “technological
unemployment” back into the academic discourse, some 80 years after he
coined the phrase. On Wednesday, Pew Research and Elon University
released a report titled “[AI, Robotics, and the Future of
Jobs](http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/).” The
report compiles and summarizes the results of a sort of expert opinion
survey in which the researchers asked 1,900 economists, management
scientists, industry analysts, and policy thinkers one big question:
“Will networked, automated, artificial intelligence applications and
robotic devices have displaced more jobs than they have created by
2025?”

“Automation is Voldemort: the terrifying force nobody is willing to
name,” said one respondent.

The results of the survey were fascinating. Almost exactly half of the
respondents (48 percent) predicted that intelligent software will
disrupt more jobs than it can replace. The other half predicted the
opposite.

The lack of expert consensus on such a crucial and seemingly
straightforward question is startling. It’s even more so given that
history and the leading economic models point so clearly to one side of
the question: the side that reckons society will adjust, new jobs will
emerge, and technology will eventually leave the economy stronger. Even
Keynes in 1930 assured his readers that technological unemployment would
be only a “[temporary phase of
maladjustment](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/9987095/JM-Keyness-prophecy-of-prosperity-after-the-gloom-of-recession.html).”
This view has been so widely held for so long that the dissenters have
taken on a derogatory label: Luddites. The original Luddites were
handloom weavers in England who smashed and burned power looms and mills
on the theory that technology posed a fundamental threat to human
well-being. Who’d have thought that half the mainstream experts in the
United States in the year 2014 would share the Luddites’ basic view of
automation’s effects on the labor market?

“Automation is Voldemort: the terrifying force nobody is willing to
name,” declared one respondent quoted in the Pew report. “Good-paying
jobs will be increasingly scarce,” said another, NASA program manager
Mark Nall. “I’m not sure that jobs will disappear altogether,” allowed
Justin Reich of Harvard University’s Berkman Center for Internet and
Society, “but the jobs that are left will be lower paying and less
secure than those that exist now.”

Is this dim view justified? I put that question to McAfee, who along
with fellow MIT researcher Brynjolfsson helped to launch the current
debate about the effects of automation with their 2011 e-book [*Race
Against the
Machine*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005WTR4ZI/?tag=slatmaga-20) and 2014
follow-up [*The Second Machine
Age*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393239357/?tag=slatmaga-20).

McAfee, who specializes in the effects of information technology on
business, is unreservedly sanguine when it comes to technology’s effects
on economic growth. “I’m super-optimistic about the size of the pie,” he
told me. But even he is increasingly nervous about its effects on
employment, and middle-class jobs in particular.

“It’s fairly unambiguous at this point that the middle class has been
getting hollowed out,” McAfee said. “The balance between capital and
labor is shifting, and the best work on that shift clearly cites
information technology as the reason.”

McAfee believes the education system has to change to prepare young
people for a world in which most of today’s jobs are automated. He’s
just not sure whether it can change fast enough. “The closer we look,
the more it seems like some of these transitions have not just been, you
know, 24 or 36 months and then everybody’s OK,” McAfee said. “They’ve
been long, they’ve been difficult in some ways, and they’ve required
pretty serious policy responses. [Columbia University economist] Joe
Stiglitz talks about how the mechanization of agriculture may have made
the Great Depression last as long as it did.”

It’s possible that today’s hand-wringing is simply a result of people
underestimating the power of capitalist economies to adapt and thrive.
They’ve certainly done so in the past. And remember, half of Pew’s
respondents still think we’ll be just fine.

Still, there’s no guarantee that the future will resemble the past. It
should be deeply unsettling to policymakers that so many of the smart
people who think about these issues believe this time could be
fundamentally different.

I think the answer is fairly straightforward: create a guaranteed
minimum income. Tax all income after that. As productivity goes up, you
increase the guaranteed minimum income. More...

One more thing: Even if Keynes is right that the pain caused by
automation is temporary, and that the economy will adjust in the long
run, it’s worth keeping in mind another famous quote from the same great
economist: “In the long run, we’re all dead.”
