### Has the United States, by Virtue of Its Size and Complexity, Become Ungovernable?—Posner

There are, especially in Europe and East Asia, and to a limited extent
in the Western Hemisphere, small countries that are well governed. But
among large, populous countries, there appears to be only one
well-governed country: Germany. The United States is the third largest
country by land mass (after Russia and Canada) and population (after
India and China), the wealthiest, the militarily most powerful, and
generally regarded as the leading nation in the world—its geopolitical
center. But all these are negatives from the standpoint of governance,
as are the nation’s ethnic and cultural diversity, political
divisiveness, high crime rates, and highly unequal distribution of
income. Another major negative is the difficulty of changing the U.S.
Constitution. Although there have been a number of amendments, the basic
structure, set by the original Constitution of 1789, has not been
changed significantly.

A serious problem of governance, or management, that all but the
smallest organizations, whether private or governmental, encounter is
the tension between the goals of the organization and the personal
goals, which typically differ, of the individuals who comprise the
organization. Stated differently, the individuals have personal utility
functions that differ from the organization’s utility function. The
larger the organization, the greater the divergence is likely to be and
the more difficult to minimize. The organization that is the federal
government of the United States has more than 4 million employees.

Competition between organizations is an important control on the
divergence (which economists refer to as “agency costs”—the costs
created by the fact that the employees of an organization have their own
goals that often conflict with those of their employer). But nations do
not feel the same competitive pressures as corporations. Even a small,
miserable, effectively bankrupt nation like Greece does not disappear,
as large corporations not infrequently do, because of its inefficiency.
Because corporations are simpler and smaller and also more constrained
by competition than nations, we can expect them to be managed more
efficiently, and specifically to adopt an organizational structure that
minimizes agency costs. So let’s glance at the structure of the typical
large corporation and compare it to our federal government structure.
There will be a board of directors to exercise a general but loose
supervision over the corporation (and in turn subject to very loose
control by the shareholders), intervening decisively only in crisis
situations or where there is vacancy in the office of the Chief
Executive Officer. The CEO will be the dominant figure in the
corporation, exercising something close to dictatorial power, assisted
by a small personal staff. Often he will overshadow the chairman of the
board of directors—he may even double as chairman and CEO. There will be
a Chief Operating Officer, exercising day to day management, while the
CEO, as the public face of the corporation, will formulate policy,
provide overall guidance, inspiration, and “vision,” appoint the major
subordinate corporate officials (general counsel, chief information
officer, chief financial officer, etc.), and maintain personal relations
with important investors, customers, competitors, and regulatory
officials. The corporation will have several or many operating
divisions, reporting to the COO or CEO, each headed by a vice president
or equivalent. The employees in each division will serve at the pleasure
of their superiors; no one will have fixed tenure.

Compare the federal government. The closest to a board of directors is
the Congress, but it differs mainly in having a good deal of policy
responsibility, and, since it does not appoint and is not appointed by
the President (corresponding to a corporate CEO), there is no
presumption that its policy preferences will coincide with the
President’s. The President’s exercise of his own policymaking powers
will often work at cross-purposes with Congress’s exercise of its
powers; nor can he appoint senior officials without the concurrence of a
division of the Congress, namely the Senate. A further dilution of
presidential power results form the existence of an independent federal
judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court. Federal judges and Justices have
lifetime tenure, can invalidate legislative and executive action both
federal and state, and rarely (because of that tenure) will a President
be able to appoint a majority of the Supreme Court Justices or other
federal judges.

The President has a personal staff (officially the “Executive Office of
the President”) that numbers more than 2000. The staff assists him in
overseeing the large number of “divisions” (executive departments, such
as State and Defense and free-standing agencies such as the
Environmental Protection Agency) into which the federal government is
divided. The heads of these divisions, however, do not have hiring or
firing authority, as a practical matter, over most of the employees, who
are tenured civil servants. The heads serve short terms, and often are
appointed for political reasons unrelated to experience or competence.
The brevity of their terms and frequent lack of relevant skills or
knowledge create tense relations with the tenured bureaucrats. As a
result, the President’s control over the more than 4 million federal
employees (of whom about 40 percent are military) is as a practical
matter quite limited.

A further division of government is brought about by federalism: the
division of the nation into 50 states, each with quasi-sovereign powers.
The federal government has considerable power over the states, but far
less than a CEO or COO would have over the operating divisions of their
corporation.

The structure of the federal government reflects the state of the nation
in the eighteenth century. The population was roughly 1 percent of what
it is today, there were only 13 states and as a result the Congress was
small, and the federal government was tiny. It is doubtful that starting
over in today’s circumstances a constitutional convention would create a
similar system.

The most glaring deficiency is the limited authority of the President
and the absence of an official corresponding to the Chief Operating
Officer of a private corporation. From an efficiency standpoint the
President should be able to promulgate laws (not just regulations),
subject to override by supermajorities of Congress; appoint subordinate
officials without the concurrence of the Senate; and create a position
analogous to that of a COO; this would result in a structure analogous
to that of France, which has both a President and a prime minister, the
latter being in charge of day to day governmental operations (though
France is not an example of a well-governed country). The President
should also be authorized to control the finances of the states, alter
their boundaries, appoint their principal officials, and veto their
laws. And no civil servants should have tenure. The result of all these
changes would be to conform American government to the “government” of a
large private corporation.

Maybe the President would become the “outside” partner and his Chief
Operating Officer the “inside” partner, the former dealing with
relations with foreign countries (in the broadest sense, comprehending
not only foreign relations in the conventional sense, but also
immigration, trade, and military assistance and intervention), the
latter with the formulation and implementation of domestic policies.

Of course these are not feasible reforms. Anything that strengthens the
President weakens other sources of power, not only in the government
itself (legislators, civil servants) but also in the private sector,
which through campaign donations and other forms of political activity
exert a powerful and self-interested influence on governmental action,
resulting in enormous waste and perversity.

In an interesting and ominous book by Joseph A. Tainter called *The
Collapse of Complex Societi*es (1988), the author points to historical
episodes of collapse of societies that had become too complex to manage
effectively, such as the Mayan civilization of Central American and the
Western Roman Empire. Successful societies, such as Britain, the United
States, and Germany, in the nineteenth century, and Japan and the Soviet
Union in roughly the first half of the twentieth century, tend, like
successful companies, to expand. Expansion makes governance more
complex, which can lead to ungovernability and eventual collapse.
Companies that become ungovernable can shrink to a manageable size by
selling off parts of themselves; or they can simply liquidate, in which
event their assets are sold to other companies. There are examples in
the government sphere, as in the peaceful division of Czechoslovakia
into Slovakia and the Czech Republic, or the peaceful dissolution of the
Soviet Union, but more often such fragmentation is involuntary, often
indeed violent.

I have an idea. Since there is no way a large federal government can
govern a nation of 315,000,000 people spread across 3,79,000 square
miles, lets devise a system where the federal government is primarily
responsible for defense, international trade and affairs, protecting
rights, minting currency, and making sure states don't put up trade
barriers. In fact, let's explicitly ban the federal government from
doing anything else. Let's relegate all other such power to these
individual entities called states, each of which will contain far less
land, and far less population than the nation as a whole!!!!

Oh wait; I guess that's what the constitution was supposed to do.

The large number of government programs that have failed to carry out
their duties and the dim view many Americans have towards Washington may
be starting to take its toll on those who think big government is the
answer. The Democratic Party has long been thought of as the party of
"big government" filled with believers that government can solve and is
the answer to curing many of our woes. Sadly cost and reality are
quickly beginning to show the flaws in this theory, government is far
better at providing access of citizens and good at passing popular laws,
but the private sector tends to be more efficient and better at
controlling costs. More on the subject of the "flawed concept of big
government" in the post below,
