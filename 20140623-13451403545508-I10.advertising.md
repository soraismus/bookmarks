In the summer of 2003, Viacom executive Mel Karmazin managed to sum up
old media’s horror of the Internet with one of business lore’s greatest
vulgar one-liners. Karmazin, a swaggering former ad salesman and onetime
CBS Corporation president, had made an expedition to check out Silicon
Valley’s hottest young upstart: Google. Sitting in the future search
giant’s offices, he listened in dismay as its founders, Larry Page and
Sergey Brin, and its CEO, Eric Schmidt, detailed the many ways their
company could track and analyze the effectiveness of online advertising.
This could not possibly be good for business, Karmazin thought. It had
always been nearly impossible for marketers to tell which of their ads
worked and which didn’t, and the less they knew, the more a network like
CBS could charge for a 30-second spot. Art was far more profitable than
science.

As Ken Auletta later recounted in his [2009 history of

Karmazin stared at his hosts and blurted out, “You’re f---ing with the
magic!”

A decade later, someone finally seems to be, well, messing with Google’s
own bag of tricks. Last year, a group of economists working with eBay’s
internal research lab
[issued](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/harvard_business_review/2013/03/paid_search_ads_did_ebay_just_prove_they_don_t_work.html)
a massive experimental study with a simple, startling conclusion: For a
large, well-known brand, search ads are probably worthless. This month,
their findings [were re-released](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20171.pdf)
as a working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research and
greeted with a
[round](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/06/a-dangerous-question-does-internet-advertising-work-at-all/372704/)
of
[coverage](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-06-12/online-journalism-is-suffering-print-s-fate)
asking whether Internet advertising of any kind works at all.

“We know a lot less than the advertising industry would like us to think
we know,” Steven Tadelis, one of the eBay study’s co-authors, told me.

Ask
[Google](http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2014/the-billion-dollar-question-whats-the-real-return-in-investment-from-online-advertising.html),
[Facebook](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/03/facebook_advertisement_studies_their_ads_are_more_like_tv_ads_than_google.single.html),
or
[Twitter](http://recode.net/2014/06/17/surprise-twitter-ad-partnership-research-says-twitter-ads-are-great-and-up-sales/),
of course, and they’ll reliably bust out third-party research explaining
that their ads work just fine, even if consumers don’t always click on
them. An entire ecosystem of analytics companies, including big names
like ComScore and Nielsen, has evolved to tell clients which online
advertisements give them the biggest bang for their bucks. Especially
cutting-edge firms, such as [Datalogix, have even found
ways](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/03/facebook_advertisement_studies_their_ads_are_more_like_tv_ads_than_google.single.html)
to draw correlations between the ads consumers see online and what they
buy in stores. We are swimming in data. And there are plenty of
professionals out there happy to tell corporate America what all that
data means, with the help of some fancy mathematical models.

The problem, according to Tadelis and others, is that much of the data
websites generate is more or less useless. Some of the problems are
practically as old as marketing itself. For instance, companies like to
run large ad campaigns during major shopping seasons, like Christmas.
But if sales double come December, it’s hard to say whether the ad or
the holiday was responsible. Companies also understandably prefer to
target audiences they think will like what they’re selling. But that
always leads to the nagging question of whether the customer would have
gone and purchased the product regardless. Economists call this issue
“[endogeneity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeneity_(applied_statistics)).”
Derek Thompson at the*Atlantic* dubs it the “[I-was-gonna-buy-it-anyway
problem](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/06/a-dangerous-question-does-internet-advertising-work-at-all/372704/).”

Consumer behavior is so erratic that it’s difficult to arrive at useful
conclusions.

But the Internet also gunks up attempts at analysis in its own special
ways. For instance, if somebody searches for “[Amazon, banana
slicer](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0047E0EII/?tag=slatmaga-20),” and
clicks on a search ad that pops up right next to his results, chances
are he would have made it to Amazon’s site without the extra nudge. Even
if he never typed the word *Amazon*, he still might have gotten to the
site through the natural power of search. In the end, it all comes down
to the evergreen challenge of distinguishing correlation (e.g., a
Facebook user saw an ad and then bought some shoes) from causation
(e.g., a Facebook user bought some shoes *because* he saw an ad).

There is, however, a way to get around these hurdles: Run an experiment.
Most analytics companies don’t do that, relying instead on elaborate
statistical regressions that try to fix flawed data. But it’s the route
Tadelis—now a business professor at the University of California,
Berkeley—and his collaborators Tom Blake and Chris Nosko took with eBay.
In their first test, the researchers looked at what would happen if the
company stopped buying ads next to its own name, which seemed like the
most obvious waste of money. To do so, they pulled the ads from Yahoo
and MSN but left them running on Google. It turns out, the advertising
made virtually no difference. Yet eBay was spending dollars every time a
customer clicked an ad instead of the link sitting right below it.

The second test was more intriguing, and more worrisome for Google. The
group wanted to see what would happen if eBay stopped buying ads next to
results for normal keyword searches that didn’t include brand names,
like “banana slicer,” “shoes,” or “electric guitar.” In the name of
science, the company then randomly shut down its Google ads in some
geographic regions and left them running in others. The results here
were a bit more nuanced. On average, the ads didn’t seem to have much
impact at all on *frequent* eBay users—they still made it to the site.
But they did seem to lure a few *new* customers.

“For people who’ve never used eBay or never heard of eBay, those ads
were extremely profitable,” Tadelis said. “The problem was that for
every one of those guys, there were dozens of guys who were going to
eBay anyway.” Add it all up, and eBay’s search ads turned out to be a
money-loser.

Tadelis and his team believe that the results would probably be the same
for most well-known brands. But for smaller companies—where customers
might not know about them without the search ads, and who probably
wouldn’t rank as high in results—it could be different.

Overall, the eBay paper isn’t great news for Google. But it also
confirms some of the promise of online advertising. Even if many
analytics companies don’t use a gold standard—a randomized control
experiment to figure out if their clients are getting their money’s
worth—it *is* theoretically possible to show that the ads work.

It isn’t easy, of course. In 2013, Randall Lewis of Google and Justin
Rao of Microsoft released the paper “[On the Near Impossibility of
Measuring the Returns on
Advertising](http://justinmrao.com/lewis_rao_nearimpossibility.pdf).” In
it, they analyzed the results of 25 different field experiments
involving digital ad campaigns, most of which reached more than 1
million unique viewers. The gist: Consumer behavior is so erratic that
even in a giant, careful trial, it’s devilishly difficult to arrive at a
useful conclusion about whether advertisements work.

For example, when the researchers calculated the return on investment
for each ad campaign, the median standard error was a massive 51
percent. In other words, even if the analysis suggested an ad buy
delivered a 50 percent return, it was possible that the company actually
lost money. You couldn’t say for sure. “As an advertiser, the data are
stacked against you,” the researchers concluded. That bodes poorly for
your typical marketing schmo trying to glean meaning from a Google
analytics page—all he can do is try to stack enough data to overcome his
statistical problems.

Still, in an email, Lewis told me that he believes “online ads
absolutely work.” Or, at least, they *can* work. For instance, Lewis and
his Google colleague David Reiley have
[written](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2268215)
[papers](http://www.davidreiley.com/papers/DoesRetailAdvertisingWork.pdf)
showing that display ads on Yahoo led to more customers making purchases
in stores. The problem, Lewis argues, is that most analytics firms
aren’t scientific enough about measuring profitability. Because they
don’t run real experiments, he thinks most end up conflating correlation
and causation.

In our interview, Tadelis****put his advice to advertisers a little more
bluntly. “If you were comfortable for the past 100 years, if you were
comfortable pissing in the wind and hoping it goes in the right
direction, don’t kid yourself now by looking at this data.”

I imagine Mel Karmazin would approve.
