Fully automatized JavaScript environment with yeoman and require.js for lazy people
===================================================================================

![Fully automatized JavaScript environment with yeoman and require.js
for lazy people](/content/images/2014/Feb/Fully_auto.jpg) For a long
time I've been looking for a great of setup environment for developing
web applications which:

1.  Takes care about dependencies;
2.  Groups all files in one for deployment;
3.  Changes are reflected in the browser as soon as I change the files
    (lazy);

Yes, this can also be named the **lazy people environment**. Do as less
as possible while outputting as much as possible.

So here I am to present to you the **Yeoman** framework used with
**requirejs** (automatically loads the files you need in the order you
need, also used to group the files in one) and **bower** (loads third
party libraries in a standard way)

#### Notice

As of today 02/12/2014 the Yeoman and require.js is quite complicated to
setup together, at least to make the build work. You can see
[here](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin/issues/192) that many have
tried to setup and it's quite complicated, but is an alternative. \
 Here you will be able to setup it easily.

Yeoman
======

[Yeoman]() is a workflow or framework but is better explained in more
friendly words. What exactly does:

-   Creates a project structure;
-   Each time you edit a file in your editor the browser automatically
    refreshes itself and loads the new version;
-   Allows to create a big JavaScript for deployment by grouping all
    your JavaScript files. The same happens for the CSS files.

Getting started
===============

Roadmap
-------

1.  Install Yeoman
2.  Create the project structure
3.  Setting up require.js

1. Install Yeoman
-----------------

This part will be the same as the one in the [Yeoman
tutorial](http://yeoman.io/).

Open a command line in any folder and run the command:

    npm install -g yo

This will install the Yeoman globally. \
 Then in the same window run the command:

    npm install -g generator-webapp

To install a generator.

A generator is just a type of project structure. There exists various
types/templates for Yeoman, but for this example we will use the webapp
one.

2. Create the project structure
-------------------------------

Open a command line in the folder you want to create the new project
(example: `c:\web\myYeoman`) and run:

    yo webapp

Press enter in the following menu. \
 This will create the project structure in the folder.

3. Setting up require.js
------------------------

### A complicated time

Nowadays is quite complicated to setup require.js with yeoman and grunt.
This is caused by some changes to usemin that doesn't allow html
requirejs blocks. Yes, kind of confusion but the older users of Yeoman
were able to use that (See issues
[a](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin/issues/112),
[b](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin/issues/172) and
[c](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin/issues/192) for more info).

### My solution

But I've figured out a practical and easy way to solve the problem. This
is my own solution, if you are interested in what others came with look
[here](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin/issues/192).

What is the idea:

-   The index.html file will not contain the `data-main="scripts/main"`
    attribute (useminPrepare no longer allow require.js blocks);
-   Divided the previous tag in two: one containing only the require.js
    file and the other containing the main.js file;
-   The main.js configures overrides the settings to:
    `baseUrl: 'scripts'`;
-   The requirejs grunt task will override the main.js created by the
    concat task just after the concat task ended. By doing this the
    process can continue as would normally do; (This is the main
    solution)

### Let's do it

The require.js is the most interesting part, this enables you to load
the files in the way you want. To install, run in the same command line
window the command:

    bower install requirejs --save

#### Setup the index.html file

Then open the file `\myYeoman\app\index.html` and add

    <script src="bower_components/requirejs/require.js"></script>

To look like this (notice the 2th line):

        <script src="bower_components/sass-bootstrap/js/tab.js"></script>
        <script src="bower_components/requirejs/require.js"></script>
        <!-- endbuild -->

        <!-- build:js({app,.tmp}) scripts/main.js -->
            <script src="scripts/main.js"></script>
        <!-- endbuild -->

View gist for complete index.html file
[here](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-index-html). Look
at:

-   Line
    [60](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-index-html-L60):
    `<script src="bower_components/requirejs/require.js"></script>`;
-   Line
    [64](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-index-html-L64):
    `<script src="scripts/main.js"></script>`;

This will make the require.js file to be loaded before the main.js file.
When you will build the application, require.js file will be included in
the `scripts/plugins.js` file because of
`<!-- build:js scripts/plugins.js -->` comment (see
[here](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-index-html-L47) in
context).

Now the tricky part is that we need to change the gruntfile.js in order
to make a final build file.

#### Setup the gruntfile.js with the require.js task

**Load the task:** You need to install `grunt-requirejs` node module
first and this is done by running the command:

    npm install grunt-requirejs --save

Then open `gruntfile.js` and add the following string (see [line
14](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-gruntfile-js-L14) so
you know where to add it exactly):

    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-requirejs');

This will load the grunt-requirejs task within grunt.

**Configure the task:** Add the requirejs task (in the same file, see
[here](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-gruntfile-js-L21) in
context):

    requirejs: {
        dist: {
            options: {
                baseUrl        : '<%= yeoman.app %>/scripts/',
                name           : 'main',
                mainConfigFile : '<%= yeoman.app %>/scripts/main.js',
                out            : '.tmp/concat/scripts/main.js'
            }
        }
    },

**Update the build task:** Edit the `build` task to be like this (in the
same file, see
[here](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-gruntfile-js-L415)
in context):

    grunt.registerTask('build', [
        'clean:dist',
        'useminPrepare',
        'concurrent:dist',
        'autoprefixer',
        'concat',
        'requirejs:dist', // <- added now
        'cssmin',
        'uglify',
        'copy:dist',
        'modernizr',
        'rev',
        'usemin',
        'htmlmin',
    ]);

View the complete gruntfile.js
[here](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-gruntfile-js). Look
at the lines:

-   Line
    [14](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-gruntfile-js-L14):
    `grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-requirejs');`;
-   Lines
    [21-30](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-gruntfile-js-L20):
    `requirejs: {...`;
-   Line
    [421](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-gruntfile-js-L421):
    `'requirejs:dist',`;

The `'requirejs:dist'` task is necessary in order to compile all your
JavaScript files in one big file.

#### Test the build

Run in the command line:

    grunt build --verbose

If warnings come up do:

    grunt build --verbose --force

But be careful to fix the warning, ask in the comments if you have any
questions about it.

By doing the build it will create a file in
`/dist/scripts/****.main.js`. Check it out and you'll see all the files
concatenated and minified, a very ugly file.

#### Final words about yeoman and require.js

I know it's a bit complicated at first but it will save you a lot of
time. All this is required in order to be able to create a final build
file that is as small as possible (minified and uglified) and that
contains all used files.

Importing jQuery
================

The web app generator already includes the jquery in the index.html, but
I prefer to use bower with require.js dependencies. So remove the script
tag with jquery from the index.html and continue with the tutorial.

In the command line window run:

    bower install jquery --save

This will create a folder in your project
`myYeoman/app/bower_components/jquery` that will contain a lot of js
files. You want the `jquery.js` file so you will require it from the
`main.js` file.

As jquery doesn't exactly work with require.js because doesn't follow
the [AMD](http://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/) module standard
format you have to configure the jquery in your `main.js` in order to be
loaded correctly. To do that open your `main.js` file and write (see
[here](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-main-js) in
context):

    require.config({
        baseUrl: 'scripts',
        paths: {
            'jquery': '../bower_components/jquery/jquery',
        },
        shim: {
            'jquery': {
                deps: [],
                exports: '$'
            }
        }
    });

The `paths` part defined where the file is on disk.

-   `shim` and `deps`: defines the dependencies of the jquery module;
-   `shim` and `exports: '$'`: defines that the jquery will output a `$`
    global variable;
-   `paths.jquery`: defineds that the main file to load for the module
    when requesting `jquery` should be
    `../bower_components/jquery/jquery`. Notice that doesn't include the
    `.js` extension;

Here is how a jquery should be in order to don't need to configure the
module:

    define([/* deps */], function(){
        var jQuery = {...};
        return jQuery;
    })

Now to require the jquery library put in `main.js` (see
[here](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-main-js-L14) in
context):

    require(['jquery'], function($){
        // now you can do what you always done with $
        $('body').remove();
    })

Remember that your `main.js` file contains the require.js settings
(`require.config({...`) defined above and the `require(['jquery']...`
part.

Look [here](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-main-js) to see
the complete `main.js` file.

Importing multiple modules
==========================

So you might need to import more modules and define dependencies between
them, so I will show you some examples.

Import underscore
-----------------

Let's import `underscore` in your project:

    require.config({
        baseUrl: 'scripts',
        paths: {
            'jquery': '../bower_components/jquery/jquery',
            'underscore': '../bower_components/underscore/underscore',
        },
        shim: {
            'jquery': {
                deps: [],
                exports: '$'
            }
            'underscore': {
                deps: [],
                exports: '_'
            },
        }
    });

    // use here
    require(['jquery', 'underscore'], function($, _){...});

Import backbone
---------------

    require.config({
        baseUrl: 'scripts',
        paths: {
            'jquery': '../bower_components/jquery/jquery',
            'underscore': '../bower_components/underscore/underscore',
            'backbone': '../bower_components/backbone/backbone',
        },
        shim: {
            'jquery': {
                deps: [],
                exports: '$'
            }
            'underscore': {
                deps: [],
                exports: '_'
            },
            'backbone': {
                deps: [
                    'underscore',
                    'jquery'
                ],
                exports: 'Backbone'
            },
        }
    });

    // use here
    require(['jquery', 'underscore', 'backbone'], function($, _, Backbone){...});

You could also require only `backbone`:

    require(['backbone'], function(Backbone){
        // use Backbone at will!
    })

Your first module
-----------------

### Create

Create a file named `Zombie.js` like this `/app/scripts/Zombie.js` and
put into it:

    define([], function(){
        var Zombie = function(){
            // zombie stuff
        }
        return Zombie;
    })

See the complete file
[here](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186#file-zombie-js).

### Consume

Now you want to require the file in your main. Update the
`require(['jquery']...` part in order to be:

    require(['jquery', './Zombie.js'], function($, Zombie){
        // now you can do what you always done with $
        $('body').remove();
        // now you have the Zombie variable available in this context
        var zombie = new Zombie();
    })
    // Zombie is undefined here

See [here](https://gist.github.com/totty90/8963186) the full gist with
all the files.

Build it again
--------------

Build the project again to see it working with jquery and the Zombie
class.

That was all about yeoman and require.js, thanks for your time.
