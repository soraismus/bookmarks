Part 1

### June 15, 2014

In pursuit of supporting a dynamic and interactive user experience,
developers have been shifting from traditional server-rendered
multi-page applications^[1](#fn:MPAs)^ (MPAs) to client-rendered
single-page applications^[2](#fn:SPAs)^ (SPAs).

The web has matured and become a fairly capable application platform and
SPAs utilize this platform to provide better experiences to users and
developers. For users, applications can be more responsive to
interaction and better facilitate dynamic experiences that are not
possible/feasible with MPAs. For developers, building SPAs can provide a
clearer separation of concerns and tends to enforce more client-side
code structure. However, embracing SPAs is not without its drawbacks.

### MPA Pros & SPA Cons

-   **SEO** \
     Until
    [recently](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/05/understanding-web-pages-better.html),
    no major search engine executed JS. Though the only search engine
    that you care about reports to now execute JS, I would not be the
    first to question if this will put SPAs on equal footing with MPAs.
    Even if Google treats them the same, SPAs have significantly slower
    initial page-load speed and that negatively affects SEO. To serve
    fully-formed HTML, developers have resorted to crazy workarounds
    like rendering SPAs in headless browsers and serving HTML extracted
    from there. Needless to say, this introduces a whole new level of
    complexity.
-   **Page-Load Performance** \
     Serving fully-formed HTML is *fast*. Speed matters. Metrics from
    large companies have repeatedly demonstrated that user engagement
    decreases as latency increases. Rendering an initial page for an MPA
    requires fewer requests than for an SPA. For initial renders, SPAs
    additionally need to request and receive JS, execute it, and then
    request and receive data specific to that page.
-   **Connection Quality** \
     Slow or inconsistent connections can make SPAs unusable. This is
    particularly important for mobile users.
-   **Accessibility** \
     Most screen readers and “read it later” applications don’t execute
    JS. The award for worst use of an SPA has to go to Google’s Blogger;
    an application ostensibly meant to serve mostly static documents
    that is now slower than when it was an MPA and unusable without JS.
-   **Graceful Degradation** \
     MPAs tend to degrade more gracefully than SPAs. You’re stuck with a
    blank page if JS fails to load on an SPA page, but you can probably
    still view the page and click links if it fails to load on an MPA
    page.
-   **Maintainability** \
     Validation, routing, and other logic often need to be shared by the
    client-side and server-side code. However, the codebases are
    typically written in different languages, so logic needs to be
    duplicated and then kept in sync.

### (Multi|Single)-Page Applications

We want a hybrid approach that blends the benefits of MPAs and SPAs. We
want to serve fully-formed HTML for initial requests and, after the page
loads, we want the client-side application to take over and become an
SPA. We want to avoid the above issues and enjoy all of the benefits of
SPAs without paying the costs traditionally incurred by them.

Isomorphic is a term used to describe applications where the frontend
and backend code are written in the same language and share a
significant amount of logic, which facilitates features like this.
Isomorphism has primarily been achieved by using
JS^[3](#fn:or-something-like-js)^ on the server. In fact, I’ve only seen
the term “Isomorphic” used when immediately preceding “JavaScript,” but
that doesn’t have to be the case.

### A Better Language

ClojureScript tools have changed dramatically in the past year.

-   [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), an excellent JS library
    for rendering, was released in May 2013. React supports multiple
    render targets; it can render to a DOM element or to an HTML string.
-   [Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om), a ClojureScript wrapper for
    React that provides some important performance and architectural
    advantages, was released in January 2014.
-   JDK 8, which ships with a high-performance JavaScript engine called
    Nashorn that is compatible with React, was released in March 2014.
-   [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async/), a
    Clojure[Script] library that provides a great concurrency model, was
    released in June 2013.
-   [Sente](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente/), a Clojure[Script]
    library for bidirectional asynchronous communication over HTTP and
    Web Sockets via core.async’s channel interface, was released in
    February 2014.

Though the toolset is not yet complete (which I will discuss further in
Part 2), these libraries go a long way toward enabling isomorphism where
it was previously infeasible.

Instead of running JS across the entire stack, we could run server-side
Clojure, client-side ClojureScript, render fully-formed HTML using
Nashorn with Om/React, and share client and server code since Clojure
and ClojureScript have nearly identical syntax and semantics.

### Is Clojure[Script] Ready?

I wrote [Omelette](https://github.com/DomKM/omelette), an example
application, to experiment with isomorphic Clojure[Script] patterns.
It’s a basic word-finding application. Given a string and desired
position/s, it returns a list of words where the string is in the
desired position. For example, searching for words that start with “om”
would return a list that includes “omelette.”

The goal was to make an isomorphic SPA where all routes are renderable
by the server without a significant amount of extra work, code
duplication, or `(if server? ...)` conditionals. Additionally, the
client-side code should be able to take over transparently and quickly;
no white flash and no additional requests.

### Abstractions

The code needed to work in three dissimilar environments: Clojure in the
JVM, ClojureScript in Nashorn in the JVM, and ClojureScript in the
browser. Sharing code requires abstractions.

#### State Management

The state of the application needs to be able to be usable in every
environment. This one is easy since Clojure and ClojureScript have
nearly identical syntax and semantics and can serialize to and
deserialize from [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn).

Omelette stores application state as a 2-tuple where the elements are a
namespaced page keyword and a map of page data. For example, an
application state of
`[:omelette.page/search {:query "bloop" :options #{:prefix}}]`
represents the “Search” page with a query input value of `"bloop"` and
the `:prefix` option checked, while
`[:omelette.page/about {:markdown "# About ..."}]` represents the
“About” page with Markdown content.

#### Rendering

The application needs to be able to render to a DOM element and to an
HTML string on the client-side and server-side respectively. Also, the
client-side application needs to be able to transition from static,
server-rendered HTML to dynamic DOM rendering when it initializes in a
browser.

Omelette uses Om/React for rendering. To serve HTML, Omelette
server-side code uses an application state 2-tuple to render the view to
a string within Nashorn, which returns a normal instance of
`java.lang.String`. The HTML is embedded in a `div` in the document
layout. The state is also serialized as EDN and embedded in the layout
so that, when Omelette client-side code initializes in a browser, it
doesn’t have to make an additional request to fetch the initial data.

#### Data Retrieval and Persistence

Retrieving and persisting data needs to be easy to do for both initial
page requests and running client-side applications.

Omelette uses Sente for communication and reuses Sente’s handler
function for server-side rendering. Using the same handler makes it very
easy to share this functionality.

#### Routing

Routing needs to work without requiring access to environment-specific
things like the browser’s `window` object or the server’s incoming HTTP
request. However, routes should be *able* to make use of
environment-specific things, particularly on the server for
authentication and authorization.

Omelette’s search page is rendered at `"/"`, `"/search"`, and
`"/search/:options/:query"` where `:options` is the desired position/s
and `:query` is the target string. For example, `"/search/prefix/bloop"`
is the path to find words that start with `"bloop"`. The “About” page is
rendered at `"/about"`.

Routing in Omelette is unlike any routing functionality that I have seen
elsewhere, so we should probably discuss it here. It has two steps:

1.  A path (`"/search/bloop/prefix"`) is transformed into an application
    state 2-tuple
    (`[:omelette.page/search {:query "bloop" :options #{:prefix}}]`).
2.  An application state 2-tuple
    (`[:omelette.page/search {:query "bloop" :options #{:prefix}}]`) is
    passed through a handler function that pattern matches the state
    using [core.match](https://github.com/clojure/core.match) and
    returns or responds with a modified state
    (`[:omelette.page/search {:query "bloop" :options #{:prefix} :results ("bloop" "blooper" "blooping")}]`)

All routes and application states are bidirectional. For example, the
path `"/search/bloop/prefix"` can be derived from the application state
returned from either of the above steps.

Additionally, though this is not strictly routing, document titles can
be derived from application states. This is used for setting and
updating the document title on the server and client respectively.

Routing in Omelette is entirely ad hoc. In other words, routes are not
defined using any sort of abstraction, but are manually converted to and
from application state 2-tuples.

Routing is not a solved problem. There are no major Clojure[Script]
routing libraries.

### Step by Step

1.  A request is made to `"/search/prefix/bloop"`.
2.  The request is converted to application state 2-tuple:
    `[:omelette.page/search {:query "bloop" :options #{:prefix}}]`.
3.  The state gets passed through a handler function that returns a
    complete state:
    `[:omelette.page/search {:query "bloop" :options #{:prefix} :results ("bloop" "blooper" "blooping")}]`.
4.  The complete state is serialized to EDN and passed to Om/React
    through Nashorn, which returns an HTML string for that state.
5.  The Om/React HTML string and application state EDN are inserted into
    the `body` of an HTML layout to form a complete document.
6.  A response is sent with the document and a status that is determined
    by the page keyword; 404 if `:omelette.page/not-found`, 200
    otherwise.
7.  The Om/React application loads, uses the embedded EDN as the initial
    application state, and then mounts into the embedded HTML.
8.  The ClojureScript router listens for navigation events and
    application state changes.
9.  When the ClojureScript router detects a change, it updates
    `window.history` and sends the new application state (either the
    authoritative state or a state derived from the navigation event) to
    the server via Sente.
10. Sente passes the new state to the Clojure handler function. Since
    this time it is not an initial request, the router responds via
    Sente with an updated state.
11. Sente passes the new new state to the ClojureScript handler function
    which then updates the application state.
12. GOTO 9

### Wrapping Up

The full code for Omelette:
[github.com/DomKM/omelette](https://github.com/DomKM/omelette)

Take a look at [`omelette.render` to see how Nashorn is
used](https://github.com/DomKM/omelette/blob/master/src%2Fomelette%2Frender.clj)
and [`omelette.view` to read through the Om code for
rendering](https://github.com/DomKM/omelette/blob/master/src%2Fomelette%2Fview.cljs).
The bulk of Omelette’s code is in
[`omelette.route`](https://github.com/DomKM/omelette/blob/master/src%2Fomelette%2Froute.cljx)
This uses [cljx](https://github.com/lynaghk/cljx), a tool that compiles
.cljx files to both .clj and .cljs files. Forms prepended with `#+clj`
and `#+cljs` will only be output to .clj and .cljs files respectively.
This makes it easy to target both Clojure and ClojureScript with the
same codebase. `omelette.route` provides routing helper functions, a
ClojureScript router component using Om, and a Clojure router component
using the descriptively but generically named
[Component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component).

Part 2 will discuss problems with the above approach to isomorphic
Clojure[Script] and new libraries/patterns to alleviate these problems.
Spoiler: It will be feasible to do server-side rendering without using
Nashorn or any JS engine in the not-too-distant future.

1.  An MPA is a website that serves fully-formed or mostly-formed HTML
    when a client requests a page. Links cause the browser to request a
    new page; blowing away the previous DOM, CSSOM, and JS context. If
    rendered without JS execution, MPAs remain viewable and at least
    partially usable. [↩](#fnref:MPAs)

2.  An SPA is a website that serves mostly bare HTML. Upon
    initialization, the JS requests data for that page and updates the
    DOM. Clicking links trigger asynchronous requests for new data and
    then modify the DOM (and sometimes `window.history` or
    `window.location`). The same DOM, CSSOM, and JS contexts live
    through the entire client session. [↩](#fnref:SPAs)

3.  Or a language like CoffeeScript that is little more than syntactic
    sugar for JavaScript. [↩](#fnref:or-something-like-js)
