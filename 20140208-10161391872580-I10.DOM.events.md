Click, touch, load, drag, change, input, error, resize — the list of
possible DOM events is lengthy. Events can be triggered on any part of a
document, whether by a user’s interaction or by the browser. They don’t
just start and end in one place; they flow though the document, on a
life cycle of their own. This life cycle is what makes DOM events so
extensible and useful. As developers, **we should understand how DOM
events work**, so that we can harness their potential and build engaging
experiences.

Throughout my time as a front-end developer, I felt that I was never
given a straight explanation of how DOM events work. My aim here is to
give you a clear overview of the subject, to get you up to speed more
quickly than I did.

I will introduce the basics of working with DOM events, then delve into
their inner workings, explaining how we can make use of them to solve
common problems.

### Listening For Events

In the past, browsers have had major inconsistencies in the way they
attach event listeners to DOM nodes. Libraries such as
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery") have been invaluable in
abstracting away these oddities.

As we move ever closer to standardized browser environments, we can more
safely use the APIs from the official specification. To keep it simple,
I will describe how to manage events for the modern Web. If you are
writing JavaScript for Internet Explorer (IE) 8 or below, I would advise
using a
[polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.removeEventListener#Polyfill_to_support_older_browsers "addEventListener polyfill")
or framework (such as [jQuery](http://jquery.com "jQuery")) to manage
event listeners.

In JavaScript, we can listen to events using this:

    element.addEventListener(<event-name>, <callback>, <use-capture>);

-   `event-name` (string)\
     This is the name or type of event that you would like to listen to.
    It could be any of the standard DOM events (`click`, `mousedown`,
    `touchstart`, `transitionEnd`, etc.) or even your own custom event
    name (we’ll touch on custom events later).
-   `callback` (function)\
     This function gets called when the event happens. The `event`
    object, containing data about the event, is passed as the first
    argument.
-   `use-capture` (boolean)\
     This declares whether the callback should be fired in the “capture”
    phase. (Don’t worry: We’ll explain what that means a little later.)

<!-- -->

    var element = document.getElementById('element');

    function callback() {
      alert('Hello');
    }

    // Add listener
    element.addEventListener('click', callback);

[Demo: addEventListener](http://jsbin.com/ayatif/2/edit)

### Removing Listeners

Removing event listeners once they are no longer needed is a best
practice (especially in long-running Web applications). To do this, use
the `element.removeEventListener()` method:

    element.removeEventListener(<event-name>, <callback>, <use-capture>);

But `removeEventListener` has one catch: You must have a reference to
the callback function that was originally bound. Simply calling
`element.removeEventListener('click');` will not work.

Essentially, if we have any interest in removing event listeners (which
we should in “long-lived” applications), then we need to keep a handle
on our callbacks. This means we cannot use anonymous functions.

    var element = document.getElementById('element');

    function callback() {
      alert('Hello once');
      element.removeEventListener('click', callback);
    }

    // Add listener
    element.addEventListener('click', callback);

[Demo: removeEventListener](http://jsbin.com/ayamur/1/edit)

### Maintaining Callback Context

An easy gotcha is callbacks being called with the incorrect context.
Let’s explain with an example.

    var element = document.getElementById('element');

    var user = {
     firstname: 'Wilson',
     greeting: function(){
       alert('My name is ' + this.firstname);
     }
    };

    // Attach user.greeting as a callback
    element.addEventListener('click', user.greeting);

    // alert => 'My name is undefined'

[Demo: Incorrect callback context](http://jsbin.com/atoluy/1/edit)

#### Using Anonymous Functions

We expected the callback to correctly alert us with `My name is Wilson`.
In fact, it alerts us with `My name is undefined`. In order for
`this.firstName` to return `Wilson`, `user.greeting` must be called
within the context (i.e. whatever is left of the dot when called) of
`user`.

When we pass the `greeting` function to the `addEventListener` method,
we are only passing a reference to the function; the context of `user`
is not passed with it. Internally, the callback is called in the context
of `element`, which means that `this` refers to `element`, not to
`user`. Therefore, `this.firstname` is undefined.

There are two ways to prevent this context mismatch. First, we can call
`user.greeting()` with the correct context inside an anonymous function.

    element.addEventListener('click', function() {
      user.greeting();
      // alert => 'My name is Wilson'
    });

[Demo: Anonymous functions](http://jsbin.com/onomud/1/edit)

#### Function.prototype.bind

The last method isn’t so good because now we don’t have a handle on the
function when we want to remove it with `.removeEventListener()`. Plus,
it’s pretty ugly. I prefer to use the
[`.bind()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind "Function.prototype.bind")
method (built into all functions, as of ECMAScript 5) to generate a new
function (`bound`) that will always run in the given context. We then
pass that function as the callback to `.addEventListener()`.

    // Overwrite the original function with
    // one bound to the context of 'user'
    user.greeting = user.greeting.bind(user);

    // Attach the bound user.greeting as a callback
    button.addEventListener('click', user.greeting);

We also have a reference to the callback at hand, which we can use to
unbind the listener if need be.

    button.removeEventListener('click', user.greeting);

[Demo: Function.prototype.bind](http://jsbin.com/ozolec/1/edit)

Check the [support
page](http://kangax.github.io/es5-compat-table/#Function.prototype.bind)
for `Function.prototype.bind` and
[polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind#Compatibility)
if you need it.

### The Event Object

The event object is created when the event first happens; it travels
with the event on its journey through the DOM. The function that we
assign as a callback to an event listener is passed the event object as
its first argument. We can use this object to access a wealth of
information about the event that has occurred:

-   `type` (string)\
     This is the name of the event.
-   `target` (node)\
     This is the DOM node where the event originated.
-   `currentTarget` (node)\
     This is the DOM node that the event callback is currently firing
    on.
-   `bubbles` (boolean)\
     This indicates whether this is a “bubbling” event (which we’ll
    [explain later](#bubble-phase)).
-   `preventDefault` (function)\
     This prevents any default behaviour from occurring that the user
    agent (i.e. browser) might carry out in relation to the event (for
    example, preventing a `click` event on an `<a>` element from loading
    a new page).
-   `stopPropagation` (function)\
     This prevents any callbacks from being fired on any nodes further
    along the event chain, but it does not prevent any additional
    callbacks of the same event name from being fired on the current
    node. (We’ll talk about that [later](#stopping-propagation).)
-   `stopImmediatePropagation` (function)\
     This prevents any callbacks from being fired on any nodes further
    along the event chain, including any additional callbacks of the
    same event name on the current node.
-   `cancelable` (boolean)\
     This indicates whether the default behaviour of this event can be
    prevented by calling the
    [`event.preventDefault`](#preventing-default) method.
-   `defaultPrevented` (boolean)\
     This states whether the `preventDefault` method has been called on
    the event object.
-   `isTrusted` (boolean)\
     An event is said to be “trusted” when it originates from the device
    itself, not synthesized from within JavaScript.
-   `eventPhase` (number)\
     This number represents the phase that the event is currently in:
    none (`0`), capture (`1`), target (`2`) or bubbling (`3`). We’ll go
    over event phases [next](#event-phases).
-   `timestamp` (number)\
     This is the date on which the event occurred.

Many other properties can be found on the event object, but they are
specific to the type of event in question. For example, mouse events
will include `clientX` and `clientY` properties on the event object to
indicate the location of the pointer in the viewport.

It’s best to use your favorite browser’s debugger or a `console.log` to
look more closely at the event object and its properties.

### Event Phases

When a DOM event fires in your app, it doesn’t just fire once where the
event originated; it embarks on a journey of three phases. In short, the
event flows from the document’s root to the target (i.e. capture phase),
then fires on the event target (target phase), then flows back to the
document’s root (bubbling phase).

[![eventflow](http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/eventflow.png)](http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/eventflow.png)\
 *(Image source:
[W3C](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-flow))*

[Demo: Slow motion event
path](http://jsbin.com/exezex/4/edit?css,js,output)

#### Capture Phase

The first phase is the capture phase. The event starts its journey at
the root of the document, working its way down through each layer of the
DOM, firing on each node until it reaches the event target. The job of
the capture phase is to build the propagation path, which the event will
travel back through in the bubbling phase.

As mentioned, you can listen to events in the capture phase by setting
the third argument of `addEventListener` to `true`. I have not found
many use cases for capture phase listeners, but you could potentially
prevent any clicks from firing in a certain element if the event is
handled in the capture phase.

    var form = document.querySelector('form');

    form.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
      event.stopPropagation();
    }, true); // Note: 'true'

If you’re unsure, listen for events in the bubbling phase by setting the
`useCapture` flag to `false` or `undefined`.

#### Target Phase

An event reaching the target is known as the target phase. The event
fires on the target node, before reversing and retracing its steps,
propagating back to the outermost document level.

In the case of nested elements, mouse and pointer events are always
targeted at the most deeply nested element. If you have listened for a
`click` event on a `<div>` element, and the user actually clicks on a
`<p>` element in the div, then the `<p>` element will become the event
target. The fact that events “bubble” means that you are able to listen
for clicks on the `<div>` (or any other ancestor node) and still receive
a callback once the event passes through.

#### Bubbling Phase

After an event has fired on the target, it doesn’t stop there. It
bubbles up (or propagates) through the DOM until it reaches the
document’s root. This means that the same event is fired on the target’s
parent node, followed by the parent’s parent, continuing until there is
no parent to pass the event onto.

Think of the DOM as an onion and the event target as the core of the
onion. In the capture phase, the event drills into the onion through
each layer. When the event reaches the core, it fires (the target
phase), and then reverses, working its way back up through each layer
(the propagation phase). Once the event has returned to the surface, its
journey is over.

Bubbling is useful. It frees us from listening for an event on the exact
element it came from; instead, we listen on an element further up the
DOM tree, waiting for the event to reach us. If events didn’t bubble, we
would have to, in some cases, listen for an event on many different
elements to ensure that it is caught.

[Demo: Identifying event phases](http://jsbin.com/unuhec/4/edit)

The majority of, but not all, events bubble. When events do not bubble,
it is usually for a good reason. If in doubt, check [the
specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-types).

### Stopping Propagation

Interrupting the path of the event at any point on its journey (i.e. in
the capture or bubbling phase) is possible simply by calling the
`stopPropagation` method on the event object. Then, the event will no
longer call any listeners on nodes that it travels through on its way to
the target and back to the document.

    child.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
     event.stopPropagation();
    });

    parent.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
     // If the child element is clicked
     // this callback will not fire
    });

Calling `event.stopPropagation()` will not prevent any additional event
listeners from being called on the current target if multiple listeners
for the same event exist. If you wish to prevent any additional
listeners from being called on the current node, you can use the more
aggressive `event.stopImmediatePropagation()` method.

    child.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
     event.stopImmediatePropagation();
    });

    child.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
     // If the child element is clicked
     // this callback will not fire
    });

[Demo: Stopping
propagation](http://jsbin.com/aparot/3/edit?html,js,output)

### Prevent The Browser’s Default Behavior

The browser has default behaviors that will respond when certain events
occur in the document. The most common event is a link being clicked.
When a `click` event occurs on an `<a>` element, it will bubble up to
the document level of the DOM, and the browser will interpret the `href`
attribute and reload the window at the new address.

In Web applications, developers usually want to manage the navigation
themselves, without causing the page to refresh. To do this, we need to
prevent the browser’s default response to clicks and instead do our own
thing. To do this, we call `event.preventDefault()`.

    anchor.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
      event.preventDefault();
      // Do our own thing
    });

We can prevent many other default behaviors in the browser. For example,
we could prevent presses of the space bar from scrolling the page in an
HTML5 game, or we could prevent clicks from selecting text.

Calling `event.stopPropagation()` here will only prevent callbacks that
are attached further down the propagation chain from being fired. It
will not prevent the browser from doing its thing.

[Demo: Preventing default behavior](http://jsbin.com/ibotap/1/edit)

### Custom Events

The browser is not the only thing that is able to trigger DOM events. We
can create our own custom events and dispatch them on any element in the
document. This type of event would behave just the same as a regular DOM
event.

    var myEvent = new CustomEvent("myevent", {
      detail: {
        name: "Wilson"
      },
      bubbles: true,
      cancelable: false
    });

    // Listen for 'myevent' on an element
    myElement.addEventListener('myevent', function(event) {
      alert('Hello ' + event.detail.name);
    });

    // Trigger the 'myevent'
    myElement.dispatchEvent(myEvent);

Synthesizing “untrusted” DOM events on elements (for example, `click`)
to simulate user interaction is also possible. This can be useful when
testing DOM-related libraries. If you’re interested, the Mozilla
Developer Network has a [write-up on
it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events#Triggering_built-in_events).

Note the following:

-   The `CustomEvent` API is not available in IE 8 and below.
-   The [Flight](http://flightjs.github.io/) framework from Twitter
    makes use of custom events to communicate between modules. This
    enforces a highly decoupled, modular architecture.

[Demo: Custom events](http://jsbin.com/emuhef/1/edit)

### Delegate Event Listeners

Delegate event listeners are a more convenient and performant way to
listen for events on a large number of DOM nodes using a single event
listener. For example, if a list contains 100 items that all need to
respond to a `click` event in a similar way, then we could query the DOM
for all of the list items and attach an event listener to each one. This
would result in 100 separate event listeners. Whenever a new item is
added to the list, the `click` event listener would have to be added to
it. Not only does this risk getting expensive, but it is tricky to
maintain.

Delegate event listeners can make our lives a lot easier. Instead of
listening for the `click` event on each element, we listen for it on the
parent `<ul>` element. When an `<li>` is clicked, then the event bubbles
up to the `<ul>`, triggering the callback. We can identify which `<li>`
element has been clicked by inspecting the `event.target`. Below is a
crude example to illustrate:

    var list = document.querySelector('ul');

    list.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
      var target = event.target;
     
      while (target.tagName !== 'LI') {
        target = target.parentNode;
        if (target === list) return;
      }

      // Do stuff here
    });

This is better because we have only the overhead of a single event
listener, and we no longer have to worry about attaching a new event
listener when an item is added to the list. The concept is pretty simple
but super-useful.

I wouldn’t recommend using such a crude implementation in your app.
Instead, use an event delegate JavaScript library, such as FT Lab’s
[ftdomdelegate](https://github.com/ftlabs/ftdomdelegate "ftdomdelegate").
If you’re using jQuery, you can seamlessly use event delegation by
passing a selector as the second parameter to the `.on()` method.

    // Not using event delegation
    $('li').on('click', function(){});

    // Using event delegation
    $('ul').on('click', 'li', function(){});

[Demo: Delegate event
listeners](http://jsbin.com/isojul/1/edit "Demo: Delegate event listeners")

### Useful Events

#### load

The `load` event fires on any resource that has finished loading
(including any dependent resources). This could be an image, style
sheet, script, video, audio file, document or window.

    image.addEventListener('load', function(event) {
      image.classList.add('has-loaded');
    });

[Demo: Image load event](http://jsbin.com/uhimir/1/edit)

#### onbeforeunload

`window.onbeforeunload` enables developers to ask the user to confirm
that they want to leave the page. This can be useful in applications
that require the user to save changes that would get lost if the
browser’s tab were to be accidentally closed.

    window.onbeforeunload = function() {
      if (textarea.value != textarea.defaultValue) {
        return 'Do you want to leave the page and discard changes?';
      }
    };

Note that assigning an `onbeforeunload` handler prevents the browser
[from caching the
page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_Firefox_1.5_caching),
thus making return visits a lot slower. Also, `onbeforeunload` handlers
must be synchronous.

[Demo: onbeforeunload](http://jsbin.com/inelaj/2/edit)

#### Stopping Window bounce in Mobile Safari

At the Financial Times, we use a simple `event.preventDefault` technique
to prevent mobile Safari from bouncing the window when it is scrolled.

    document.body.addEventListener('touchmove', function(event) {
     event.preventDefault();
    });

Be warned that this will also prevent any native scrolling from working
( such as `overflow: scroll`). To allow native scrolling on a subset of
elements that need it, we listen for the same event on the scrollable
element and set a flag on the event object. In the callback at the
document level, we decide whether to prevent the default behavior of the
touch event based on the existence of the `isScrollable` flag.

    // Lower down in the DOM we set a flag
    scrollableElement.addEventListener('touchmove', function(event) {
     event.isScrollable = true;
    });

    // Higher up the DOM we check for this flag to decide
    // whether to let the browser handle the scroll
    document.addEventListener('touchmove', function(event) {
     if (!event.isScrollable) event.preventDefault();
    });

Manipulating the event object is not possible in IE 8 and below. As a
workaround, you can set properties on the `event.target` node.

#### resize

Listening to the resize event on the `window` object is super-useful for
complex responsive layouts. Achieving a layout with CSS alone is not
always possible. Sometimes JavaScript has to help us calculate and set
the size of elements. When the window is resized or the device’s
orientation changes, then we would likely need to readjust these sizes.

    window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
      // update the layout
    });

I recommended using a
[debounced](http://davidwalsh.name/function-debounce) callback to
normalize the callback rate and prevent extreme thrashing in the layout.

[Demo: Window resizing](http://jsbin.com/usevow/1/edit)

#### transitionEnd

Today we use CSS to power the majority of transitions and animations in
our applications. Sometimes, though, we still need to know when a
particular animation has finished.

    el.addEventListener('transitionEnd', function() {
     // Do stuff
    });

Note the following:

-   If you’re using `@keyframe` animations, use the `animationEnd` event
    name, instead of `transitionEnd`.
-   Like a lot of events, `transitionEnd` bubbles. Remember either to
    call `event.stopPropagation()` on any descendant transition events
    or to check the `event.target` to prevent callback logic from
    running when it’s not supposed to.
-   Event names are still widely vendor-prefixed (for example,
    `webkitTransitionEnd`, `msTransitionEnd`, etc). Use a library such
    as [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/ "Modernizr") to get the event
    name’s correct prefix.

[Demo: Transition end](http://jsbin.com/ijogok/1/edit)

#### animationiteration

The `animationiteration` event will fire every time a currently
animating element completes an iteration. This is useful if we want to
stop an animation but not midway through.

    function start() {
      div.classList.add('spin');
    }

    function stop() {
      div.addEventListener('animationiteration', callback);

      function callback() {
        div.classList.remove('spin');
        div.removeEventListener('animationiteration', callback);
      }
    }

If you’re interested, I’ve [written about the `animationiteration`
event](http://wilsonpage.co.uk/animation-iteration-event) in a little
more detail on my blog.

[Demo: Animation iteration](http://jsbin.com/AwoYuxE/2)

#### error

If an error occurs when a resource loads, we might want to do something
about it, especially if our users are on a flaky connection. The
Financial Times uses this event to detect any images that might have
failed to load in an article and instantly hide them. Because the “[DOM
Level 3
Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-type-error)”
specification has redefined the `error` event to “not bubble,” we can
handle the event in one of two ways.

    imageNode.addEventListener('error', function(event) {
      image.style.display = 'none';
    });

Unfortunately, `addEventListener` does not address all use cases. My
colleague [Kornel](http://twitter.com/pornelski) has kindly pointed me
to an [example that demonstrates](http://jsbin.com/esimAWA/2/quiet) that
the only way, sadly, to guarantee the execution of image `error` event
callbacks is to use (the often frowned upon) inline event handlers.

    <img src="http://example.com/image.jpg" onerror="this.style.display='none';" />

The reason for this is that you cannot be sure that the code that binds
the `error` event handler will be executed before the `error` event
actually happens. Using inline handlers means that when the markup is
parsed and the image is requested, our `error` listeners will be
attached.

### Lessons From The Event Model

A lot can be learned from the success of the DOM events model. We can
employ similar decoupled concepts in our own projects. Modules in an
application can be as complex as they need to be, so long as that
complexity is sealed away behind a simple interface. Many front-end
frameworks (such as Backbone.js) are heavily event-based, solving
cross-module communication in a publish and subscribe model that is very
similar to the DOM.

**Event-based architectures are great.** They give us a simple common
interface in which to write applications that respond to physical
interactions across thousands of devices! Via events, devices tell us
exactly what has happened and when it occurred, letting us respond
however we please. What goes on behind the scenes is not of concern; we
get a level of abstraction that frees us to get on with building our
awesome app.

    Great article, but is there is a situation where you’d use that over
    something like

~~~~ {.language-javascript}
$('element').on('event',function(){ //do something });
~~~~

    Thank you so much for the article. Gonna be a very helpful one.

    By the way, recently I was working on a project where I wanted to
    hide all the elements when the mouse is idle for a few seconds. I
    was able to use some simple javascript code and achieve that. But
    the problem was, when the mouse was kept on top the element that was
    supposed to hidden, it just flickers once and appears back.\
     [Jsfiddle:
    [http://jsfiddle.net/AMn9v/6/](http://jsfiddle.net/AMn9v/6/).\
     Any idea how can we overcome that issue and get it work as we
    intended? Even if I tried other scripts, most of them has this same
    issue.

                    @Vinod, Why would you say that? The article is about
                    DOM events and what I asked is about the same thing.
                    Where I use it just doesn’t matter at all. There are
                    people ready to help others so I think we should
                    avoid such unwanted comments.

                    BTW, Thanks Rex for your time..

                    I probably would have used CSS and jQuery for that

                    if mouse really has been moved.

    Regarding the delegate event thing, I’ve been using an alternative
    method. Your way:

~~~~ {.language-javascript}
var list = document.querySelector('ul');
list.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    while (target.tagName !== 'LI') {
        target = target.parentNode;
        if (target === list) return;
    }
    // Do stuff here});
~~~~

    However I do it like this:

~~~~ {.language-javascript}
var list = document.querySelector('ul');

list.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    if (target.tagName !== "LI") {
        return;
    }

    // Do stuff here
});
~~~~

    It’s simpler, but I’m wondering which would be faster – your way is
    essentially bubbling up the tree manually, whereas I’m simply
    waiting for the bubble to hit the element I need.

        Hi Andy!

        Your method would work for simple markup, but consider if you
        had other elements inside the `<li>` such as an `<h1>`. If the
        user clicked the `<h1>` element we would still want want the
        click handler for the `<li>` to fire, but the
        `event.target.tagName` === ‘H1′.

        We therefore have to start at the target and walk up the DOM
        checking each node in turn until we reach the element which the
        original event handler was bound.

        Hope this makes sense! I can amend the wording of the article if
        you have any suggestions :)

            I guess potentially, but sounds like dangerous territory. I
            wouldn’t view this as a bug, this is how events in the DOM
            are designed to work :)

    Nice article, thank you!

    I’m missing `DOMContentLoaded` in the Useful Events section.\
     The first Delegate Event Listeners code example shows `target`
    where it should be `event.target`. This section might also use
    [`element.matches()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.matches)
    for a (much) simpler delegation target identification.

        Thanks for the typo I have fixed :)

        \1. Regarding `DOMContentLoaded`, you’re right, we should
        probably add that to the article at some point.\
         2. `element.matches()` is super useful, I have used it in the
        past. But in this example I wanted to more demonstrate the the
        core concept of event delegation in the simplest, most familiar
        way for beginners. Maybe we should consider updating the example
        to use more modern APIs though, I’ll give it some thought :)

    I enjoyed this post, thanks for writing it – like you say it isn’t
    something that is widely talked about, front end developers just

    I will certainly be pointing people to this article that run into

    Hi! Great article. Thank you.

    One question, how much of this is already standard in the browsers?
    I programmed DOM when Netscape 4 and IE 5 were the browsers and
    making every decent web page meant several consults on
    quirksmode.org

    :)

        You can safely use element.addEventListener in IE9+. If you have
        to support lesser platforms I would advise using a an
        abstraction like jQuery.

    Hi, thank you for a nice overview of DOM events.

    One more thing worth mentioning might be, that you can also pass an
    object implementing `handleEvent` method as the second argument to
    `addEventListener`. The potential advantage is, that `this` in the
    `handleEvent` method will automatically refer to the passed object
    and not the element (which can still be accessed through
    `event.currentTarget`).

~~~~ {.language-javascript}
var obj = {
    name: 'Joe',
    handleEvent: function(event) {
        console.log('Hi, my name is %s.', this.name);
    }
};

element.addEventListener('click', obj, false);

    Great article!\
     One little mistake: an Event does not have a name, but is of some
    (named) type.\
     So the description of Event.type and the signatures of
    addEventListener and removeEventListener should be aligned with the
    spec, see
    [http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/\#widl-Event-type](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#widl-Event-type)
    and e.g.

    Understanding DOM events is a must for web developers so thanks a

    On a side note I love the \_.debounce() method. I learned something

    Hi Wilson,\
     Great post!

    Regarding the last point about accurate error reporting on images,
    Paul Irish/Desandro’s library imagesloaded is tremendously useful,
    particularly the event ‘fail’, which fires after all images have
    been loaded and at least one is confirmed broken.
