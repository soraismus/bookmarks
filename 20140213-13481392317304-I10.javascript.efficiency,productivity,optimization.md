Description
-----------

In this article, we look at how important JavaScript optimizations are
analyzed. These will be explained, including using local function
variables, avoiding references to objects or object properties, avoiding
adding short strings to long strings, and finally, using buffering to
process data in optimal sizes. These general-purpose JavaScript
optimization techniques are designed for JavaScript on all browsers.
Detailed graphs of all the performance results are given after each
optimization. You will be amazed at the incredible speed improvements in
JavaScript!

Introduction
------------

Optimization of [JavaScript computer code](http://www.javascripts.com/)
deserves attention, since JavaScript has a large impact on [Web page
performance](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html). In this
article we develop two high performance JavaScript algorithms using
several performance optimization techniques.

You can easily use the same optimization methods in your code. Every
optimization will shorten the execution speed of your program by 10 -
95% or more. Used in combination, these optimizations can mean the
difference between programs that run as slow as molasses, or
problem-crunching software that runs at a high rate of speed.

Important JavaScript optimizations
----------------------------------

Optimizations in a broad sense will involve simplifying code,
precomputing results which are repeatedly reused, and organizing code so
more results can be reused. From the standpoint of computer programming
purity, optimizations should increase the simplicity, clarity and
generality of a computer program. (See [The Practice of
Programming](http://books.internet.com/books/020161586X) by Brian
Kernighan and Rob Pike.)

Adding simplicity, clarity and generality is what these optimizations
will do. In fact, one of the optimizations adds support for Unicode and
multibyte characters such as `&nbsp;` and `&mdash;`, and still improves
performance drastically compared to the slower unoptimized version!

We analyze four optimizations in this article. More complicated
optimizations or ones with bigger payoffs are listed after easy-to-use
optimizations.

-   [Use local function variables](index.html)\
     (82% improvement, 63 microseconds versus 359).
-   [Avoid references to objects or object properties](2.html)\
     (41% improvement, 27.68 microseconds versus 47.297).
-   [Avoid adding short strings to long strings](3.html)\
     (93% improvement, 4.608 microseconds versus 62.54).
-   [Use buffering to process data in optimal sizes](4.html)\
     (96% improvement, 2.0 seconds versus 50.0).

Technique 1: Use local function variables
-----------------------------------------

When I wrote code to implement the MD5 message digest algorithm, my code
was first written in C, then transferred to JavaScript. In order to make
my [JavaScript MD5 code
faster](http://www.google.com/search?q=md5+speed+test) than everyone
else's, I had to take advantage of local function variables. What makes
my MD5 code faster are local function variables and optimized buffer
sizes, techniques that we address in this article.

Using local function variables is simple. If you have code which uses
variables repetitively, it's worthwhile to make the code into a function
to take advantage of the higher performance of local function variables.

Global variables have slow performance because they live in a
highly-populated namespace. Not only are they stored along with many
other user-defined quantities and JavaScript variables, the browser must
also distinguish between global variables and properties of objects that
are in the current context. Many objects in the current context can be
referred to by a variable name rather than as an object property, such
as `alert()` being synonymous with `window.alert()`. The down side is
this convenience slows down code that uses global variables.

Sometimes global variables also have higher performance, like local
function variables, if you declare them explicitly with the `var`
keyword. An example is `var d = document`, instead of `d = document`,
but it's not reliable. Mysterious behavior that works sometimes but not
always is a danger sign, and I feel more comfortable using local
function variables.

On the other hand, it makes sense that local function variables should
have better performance. There are few local function variables in most
functions, and references to local function variables can be converted
to efficient executable instructions by the JavaScript compiler.

It's amazing how few people are aware of simple JavaScript optimizations
like this, or who simply don't care. For example, no one else has taken
the time to re-optimize their MD5 JavaScript code. When I wrote my
`md5.js` script, I had no intention of competing for the top position,
and yet the code has been unbeaten since 2003.

Let's figure out why local function variables make a difference by
counting to a million, first without local function variables, and then
with local function variables.

### Counting to one million without local function variables

Tip: the `new Date()` object returns the time difference in milliseconds
when it's subtracted from another `new Date()` object, thus providing a
great way to time your scripts.

t0 = new Date(); var i; for (i=0; i<1000000; i++); t1 = new Date();

### Counting to one million with local function variables

function count() { var i; for (i=0; i<1000000; i++); } count(); t2 = new
Date();

### Code that gives us the results of the timing

d = document; d.write('Without local variables = ', t1-t0, '<br /\>');
d.write('With local variables = ', t2-t1, '<br /\>');

[(See Figure 1)](figure1.gif "Fig. 1")

The result is 359 milliseconds (thousandths of a second) when not using
local function variables compared to 63 milliseconds when local function
variables are used. This improvement is worth taking the extra time to
convert code into a function.
