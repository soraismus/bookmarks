### "Why I like Common Lisp"

In a recent email exchange discussion, Charlotte Herzeel gave a summary
of Common Lisp that I believe is worth repeating publicly. With her
permission, I repeat her statements here.\
 \
 “An important reason why I like Common Lisp a lot is that the language
has a layered design that supports incremental development. The language
provides very high-level programming abstractions, such as
object-oriented programming, dynamic multiple dispatch, garbage
collection, a meta-object protocol, and so on. These abstractions are
typically open implementations, built on top of more efficient low-level
abstractions the user can also choose to access directly.\
 \
 Common Lisp is typically implemented as a compiled language, compiling
directly to machine code. The runtime components are sparse, the garbage
collector being an important one. Common Lisp provides the means to
steer the compiler and runtime components to do low-level optimizations.
Examples of this include: type declarations to remove type-checking at
runtime; inline declarations to avoid dispatch; dynamic extent
declarations to perform stack allocation instead of heap allocation;
disassembly of code snippets; tuning of the garbage collector to switch
between collection strategies; and so on. Optimizations such as these
are optional and localized. Hence it is very easy in Common Lisp to
rapidly prototype and then incrementally optimize the code by
identifying the hotspots through profiling. This way you can often be as
efficient as with C code, without being forced to program in a low-level
style from the start throughout your whole program.\
 \
 Hence in contrast to C/C++, Common Lisp allows you to optimize code
incrementally and locally for a particular snippet of code. In contrast
to Java - or any other language with an implementation that performs
optimization at runtime through tracing or JIT compiling or so - Common
Lisp implementations employ in a sense a more classic compilation
approach. In this sense, Common Lisp makes it easier to ‘control’ what
you are measuring when profiling programs.\
 \
 The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) is a library in Common Lisp for
object-oriented programming. Common Lisp is a multi-paradigm language,
so it depends on your problem whether it is a good idea to use
object-oriented programming or not. That said, CLOS is very different
from mainstream object-oriented programming. It allows multiple
inheritance, multiple dispatch, and is based on generic functions, i.e.
classes define types, and methods are defined separately as part of
generic functions. The CLOS implementation performs a lot of clever
optimizations at runtime, for example for method lookup. What is of
course special about CLOS, is that it has a meta-object protocol, which
allows you to extend/modify CLOS in an organized way. For example, you
have hooks into the method dispatch protocol, the slot (= field) access
protocol, etc. If you want to know more about the CLOS implementation
and the meta-object protocol, read ‘The Art of the Meta-Object Protocol’
by Kiczales, des Rivieres, Bobrow.\
 \
 Common Lisp just has a lot of advanced language features that you just
don’t find in other languages.\
 \
 From a practical point of view, I can recommend LispWorks as a Common
Lisp implementation. LispWorks is very user-friendly because it comes
with an integrated development environment. This means you get
Smalltalk-like features such as code browsers and inspector tools.
Another user-friendly implementation that is free is Clozure Common
Lisp. The most widely used open-source implementation is SBCL, which is
very stable and very efficient. There are lots of other Common Lisp
implementations out there, but I recommend one of these three.\
 \
 If you want to learn about Common Lisp, I can recommend “Ansi Common
Lisp” by Graham. Maybe also interesting: ‘[Pascal Costanza’s highly
opinionated guide to Common Lisp](http://www.p-cos.net/lisp/guide.html)’
;-). If you want a funny introduction to Common Lisp, check out the
[Lisperati](http://lisperati.com/). A good place to snoop for Common
Lisp war stories is [Planet Lisp](http://planet.lisp.org/). If you want
to get an idea about libraries, see
[quicklisp](http://www.quicklisp.org/).”\

Great writeup. I'd add a reference to Practical Common Lisp, namely
because it's got a better introduction to CLOS than Graham's book.
