Building Better Teachers

Harry Campbell

Teaching dwarfs every other profession that requires a college degree.
Nationwide, 3.7 million schoolteachers serve grades K–12—more than all
the doctors, lawyers, and engineers in the country combined. Teacher
shortages, once chronic, abated during the recession, when layoffs were
widespread, but will soon return with a vengeance. Fully half of all
teachers are Baby Boomers on the brink of retirement. Among novice
teachers, who constitute an increasingly large proportion of the
remaining workforce, between 40 and 50 percent typically quit within
just five years, citing job dissatisfaction or more-alluring prospects.
Given this drain at both ends of the teaching pipeline, schools will
likely need to hire more than 3 million new teachers by 2020. That is an
enormous talent hole to fill.

Yet the United States has, if anything, too many teacher-training
programs. Each year, some 1,400 of them indiscriminately churn out twice
as many graduates as schools can use. Program quality varies widely, so
many would-be teachers don’t suit schools’ needs. In a scathing 2006
report, Arthur Levine, a former president of Columbia University’s
Teachers College, accused many education schools of being little more
than a “cash cow” for their hosting institution. Among the problems he
highlighted were exceedingly “low admission standards,” a “curriculum in
disarray,” and faculties “disconnected” from the realities of the
classroom.

Once hired, many teachers are left to sink or swim. In recent years,
several states have adopted controversial accountability measures, known
as “value added” metrics, with a view toward winnowing out poor
performers who haven’t produced student improvement on standardized
tests; helping teachers hone their craft has seldom made it onto the
agenda. But perhaps we’re finally ready to focus attention on the far
bigger and more important question of how to attract and retain the top
teachers we want.

This spring, the Obama administration announced plans to begin rating
teacher-training programs. Consensus on what makes an effective teacher,
however, remains elusive. Student achievement does not correlate
strongly with teachers’ years of experience in the classroom (beyond the
initial few) or with the caliber of their preparation—whether they have
acquired certification, earned a master’s degree in education, or aced
state licensing exams. Even particular personality traits, such as an
extroverted willingness to ham it up in the classroom, appear
irrelevant. The conundrum doesn’t daunt Elizabeth Green, a co-founder of
GothamSchools (a news Web site originally devoted to covering New York
City schools that has recently expanded to other cities and been
rechristened Chalkbeat). Her book, *Building a Better Teacher*, couldn’t
be better timed.

At the heart of Green’s exploration is a powerfully simple idea: that
teaching is not some mystical talent but a set of best practices that
can be codified and learned through extensive hands-on coaching,
self-scrutiny, and collaboration. Yet her account suggests that
implementing this vision may entail a bigger transformation than she
quite realizes.

Green begins by profiling an array of educators who have been inspired
by Deborah Ball, now the dean of the University of Michigan School of
Education. In the early 1980s, she was a charismatic math teacher in
East Lansing, Michigan, who developed a successful approach to teaching
even very young children sophisticated concepts in math. Instead of
relying on rote memorization or repetitive skills practice, Ball
shepherded children through in-depth discussions of a single
mathematical conjecture—for example, do two odd integers always add up
to an even number? The students, steered along by their teacher,
deliberated together to derive proofs for their various hypotheses. Some
of the most exhilarating parts of Green’s book are the detailed
descriptions of precisely how, and why, these lessons succeed. Ball
helped other teachers adopt her techniques not through the usual
education-school lectures, but through rigorous apprenticeship: mutual
observation of lessons, followed by intensive dissection of what worked
and what didn’t.

Teaching is not some mystical talent but a set of best practices that
can be codified.

Green likens the approach to the Japanese practice of*jugyokenkyu*.
“Lesson study” is the main form of teacher training in Japan, where
colleagues routinely sit in on one another’s classes and then scrutinize
a single session for hours, extracting general guidance for future
instruction. Japan substantially outperforms America in math on
international tests, and Green clearly believes *jugyokenkyu* is a
crucial factor in the country’s success. She recounts how some of Ball’s
ideas were adopted by the state of California in the mid-1980s but never
had a chance to catch on: Teachers were expected to absorb the new
policies, outlined in a state “manifesto,” and then revamp lesson plans
on their own, with little or no training or ongoing support. Some
educators didn’t even see the guidelines—all but ensuring the reforms
would fail. The rollout of the Common Core State Standards appears to be
replicating this dispiriting pattern in many places.

At first, Green decides that Teach for America and some charter-school
leaders are now following in Ball’s and Japan’s footsteps—albeit with
plenty of stumbling. She focuses on Doug Lemov, an
entrepreneurial-minded educator who started a charter school in Boston
in the mid-1990s and later became a managing director and teacher
trainer with the Uncommon Schools charter network. As part of his job,
he began compiling an inventory of effective teaching techniques. The
taxonomy became a book, *Teach Like a Champion*, and a cause célèbre
within the charter movement; videos of sample lessons circulated like
samizdat literature. There’s technique No. 2, “Right Is Right”: teachers
refuse to accept students’ half-baked responses to questions and insist
on well-formulated, and eventually correct, replies. Technique No. 32 is
“SLANT,” which stands for “Sit up, Listen, Ask and answer questions, Nod
your head, and Track the speaker,” a formula for eliciting attention
from students. But the motions of following a lesson, Green soon
discovers, aren’t necessarily a sign of genuine engagement.

The taxonomy includes plenty of useful, even commonsense, advice. Yet
Green reveals how, in practice, Lemov’s early acolytes in the charter
world became obsessed with a disciplinary approach that dictated no
talking in hallways, silent lunches, and skyrocketing suspensions for
even minor infractions. What at first appeared to be a huge
success—Lemov’s school initially posted impressive test scores—turns out
to be a more complicated story. Green finds that out of some 55 students
who started at the school in seventh grade, only 11 made it to their
senior year, an astounding rate of attrition. A later class began with
100 sixth-grade students and was winnowed to 30 by graduation.

Japanese “lesson study,” she observes, was premised on the notion that
“children needed structured opportunities to talk in order to learn.”
Lemov banked on a rather different principle: that “learning first
required the foundational ability to be quiet and listen.” As Green
concludes, Lemov had built a vocabulary that Deborah Ball might admire
for describing precisely what teachers should do in the classroom, but
applied it to “a sort of teaching that she didn’t do.” Green ends up
saluting Ball and Japan for getting the balance between classroom
discipline and student engagement right.

But Green’s account cries out for a look at the bigger picture. She is
absolutely correct about the importance of self-critical reflection and
collaboration. What she is not the first, or I’m sure the last, to miss
are the structural obstacles to importing such an apprentice-style ethos
into American teachers’ experience. As it happens, an administrator
introduced lesson study as part of the staff’s professional development
at a school where I’ve worked. There was just one problem: we
teachers—juggling tutoring before and after school, supervising clubs,
or coaching sports—had only one period a week to meet as a group. It
would be generous to say lesson study didn’t work; it never got off the
ground. There typically isn’t time in American teachers’ workdays for
this kind of collaborative enterprise.

American teachers spend far more hours in the classroom than teachers in
any other OECD country save Chile.

That lack of time is an American anomaly, and it is key. Since 2000, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been
overseeing tests of 15-year-olds every three years among its members.
The PISA exams, as they’re called, show that American students’
performance is barely above average in reading and trails substantially
in math. The tests also record other information about classroom
instruction around the world, and American researchers, policy makers,
and pundits have pored over the results for clues to improving our
schools. For example, the United States falls roughly in the middle of
the pack when it comes to class size. Countries with far larger classes
than we have, such as South Korea, outperform us. So do countries, like
Finland, with smaller ones. Not surprisingly, some reformers have
concluded that reduced class size isn’t the secret to student success.

But class size is a crude measure of a more important, encompassing
concept that is worth attending to: teacher workload. How much time do
teachers spend on classroom instruction, and how much time do they have
outside of class to devote to the other considerable, less visible
aspects of the job: lesson planning, paper grading, conferring with
students, calling parents, meeting with colleagues to discuss methods
and goals. Here, the PISA results are not ambiguous. Every single
country that outperforms us has significantly smaller teacher workloads.
Indeed, on the scale of time devoted by teachers to in-class instruction
annually, the United States is off the charts. We spend far more hours
in the classroom on average, twice and nearly three times more in some
cases, than teachers in any other OECD country save Chile. Finnish
high-school teachers, for example, clock 553 hours in the classroom each
year. In Japan, home of *jugyokenkyu,* that number is 500. In the U.S.,
it’s 1,051. (Figures for elementary and middle school show roughly the
same skew.)

In practice, this means that most teachers in this country have zero
time to work together on new pedagogical approaches and share feedback
in the way Green advocates in her book. They rarely have an opportunity
to watch other teachers teach, the single best kind of training, in my
experience; they’re too busy in their own classrooms (not to mention
outside them).

A big problem with American education, in other words, is how we
conceive of the job. Green is right: there’s much about teaching that
isn’t instinctive, and as her book usefully shows, learning how to
perfect the art is demanding. It is high time to correct a common
misimpression: teaching isn’t the relatively leisurely occupation many
people imagine, enviously invoking a nine-to-three school day and long
summer vacations, which in reality seldom exist. We think of no other
white-collar profession in terms of a single dimension of job
performance. We don’t, for example, regard lawyers as “working” only
during the hours they’re actually presenting a case before a judge; we
recognize the amount of preparation and subsequent review that goes into
such moments. If teaching is such a plum post, we might ask ourselves
why attrition rates are so high.

In closing, Green decides to teach a lesson herself and is thrilled to
find that it goes well, thanks to so many of the techniques she learned
in her reporting—and, it’s worth noting, thanks to plenty of planning.
She recounts spending hours getting ready for this one lesson, selecting
readings, conferring with a seasoned teacher, and rehearsing how she
would present the material to the class. All this, and she wasn’t
grading a single paper or speaking to parents or meeting individually
with students. Such work constitutes a large portion of what teachers do
each day. It’s why the job, done right, is so hard and burns teachers
out so fast.

The goal isn’t to lighten teachers’ load but to redistribute it. At one
point, Deborah Ball remarks that what she loves about teaching is that
it*is* so hard—by which she means intellectually challenging and
rewarding. Teaching is all-consuming, and that absorption is part of the
joy of the job. But if teaching is to be a profession of the mind (as
well as of the heart) that retains top talent and delivers results on
the same level that other countries boast, the people who spend hours
with our children in the classroom also need what they currently don’t
get: the hours with peers and mentors that are essential to improving
their craft.
