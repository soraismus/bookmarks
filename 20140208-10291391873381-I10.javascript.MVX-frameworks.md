When writing a Web application from scratch, it’s easy to feel like we
can get by simply by relying on a
[DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/About_the_Document_Object_Model)
manipulation library (like [jQuery](http://jquery.com)) and a handful of
utility plugins. The problem with this is that it doesn’t take long to
get lost in a nested pile of jQuery callbacks and DOM elements without
any real structure in place for our applications.

In short, we’re stuck with [spaghetti
code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code). Fortunately there
are modern JavaScript frameworks that can assist with bringing structure
and organization to our projects, improving how easily maintainable they
are in the long-run.

### What Is MVC, Or Rather MV\*?

These modern frameworks provide developers an easy path to organizing
their code using variations of a pattern known as
[MVC](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#detailmvcmvp)
(Model-View-Controller). MVC separates the concerns in an application
down into three parts:

-   **Models** represent the domain-specific knowledge and data in an
    application. Think of this as being a ‘type’ of data you can model —
    like a User, Photo or Note. Models should notify anyone observing
    them about their current state (e.g Views).
-   **Views** are typically considered the User-interface in an
    application (e.g your markup and templates), but don’t have to be.
    They should know about the existence of Models in order to observe
    them, but don’t directly communicate with them.
-   **Controllers** handle the input (e.g clicks, user actions) in an
    application and Views can be considered as handling the output. When
    a Controller updates the state of a model (such as editing the
    caption on a Photo), it doesn’t directly tell the View. This is what
    the observing nature of the View and Model relationship is for.

JavaScript ‘MVC’ frameworks that can help us structure our code don’t
always strictly follow the above pattern. Some frameworks will include
the responsibility of the Controller in the View (e.g
[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org)) whilst others add their own
opinionated components into the mix as they feel this is more effective.

For this reason we refer to such frameworks as following the MV\*
pattern, that is, you’re likely to have a View and a Model, but more
likely to have something else also included.

**Note:** There also exist variations of MVC known as MVP
(Model-View-Presenter) and MVVM (Model-View ViewModel). If you’re new to
this and feel it’s a lot to take in, don’t worry. It can take a little
while to get your head around patterns, but I’ve written more about the
above patterns in my online book [Learning JavaScript Design
Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#detailmvcmvp)
in case you need further help.

### When Do You Need A JavaScript MV\* Framework?

When building a single-page application using JavaScript, whether it
involves a complex user interface or is simply trying to reduce the
number of HTTP requests required for new Views, you will likely find
yourself inventing many of the pieces that make up an MV\* framework
like Backbone or Ember.

At the outset, it isn’t terribly difficult to write an application
framework that offers *some* opinionated way to avoid spaghetti code,
however to say that it is equally as trivial to write something of the
standard of Backbone would be a grossly incorrect assumption.

There’s a lot more that goes into structuring an application than tying
together a DOM manipulation library, templating and routing. Mature MV\*
frameworks typically not only include many of the pieces you would find
yourself writing, but also include solutions to problems you’ll find
yourself running into later on down the road. This is a time-saver that
you shouldn’t underestimate the value of.

So, where will you likely need an MV\* framework and where won’t you?

If you’re writing an application that will likely only be communicating
with an API or back-end data service, where much of the heavy lifting
for viewing or manipulating that data will be occurring in the browser,
you may find a JavaScript MV\* framework useful.

Good examples of applications that fall into this category are
[GMail](http://gmail.com) and [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com).
These applications typically download a single payload containing all
the scripts, stylesheets and markup users need for common tasks and then
perform a lot of additional behavior in the background. It’s trivial to
switch between reading an email or document to writing one and you don’t
need to ask the application to render the whole page again at all.

If, however, you’re building an application that still relies on the
server for most of the heavy-lifting of Views/pages and you’re just
using a little JavaScript or jQuery to make things a little more
interactive, an MV framework may be overkill. There certainly are
complex Web applications where the partial rendering of views can\* be
coupled with a single-page application effectively, but for everything
else, you may find yourself better sticking to a simpler setup.

### The Challenge Of Choice: Too Many Options?

The JavaScript community has been going through something of a
renaissance over the last few years, with developers building even
larger and more complex applications with it as time goes by. The
language still greatly differs from those more classic Software
engineers are used to using (C++, Java) as well as languages used by Web
developers (PHP, Python, .Net etc). This means that in many cases we are
borrowing concepts of how to structure applications from what we have
seen done in the past in these other languages.

In my talk “[Digesting JavaScript MVC: Pattern Abuse or
Evolution](http://addyosmani.com/blog/digesting-javascript-mvc-pattern-abuse-or-evolution/)”,
I brought up the point that there’s currently too much choice when it
comes to what to use for structuring your JavaScript application. Part
of this problem is fueled by how different JavaScript developers
interpret how a scalable JavaScript application should be organized —
MVC? MVP? MVVM? Something else? This leads to more frameworks being
created with a different take on MV\* each week and ultimately more
noise because we’re still trying to establish the “right way” to do
things, if that exists at all. Many developers believe it doesn’t.

We refer to the current state of new frameworks frequently popping up as
‘Yet Another Framework Syndrome’ (or YAFS). Whilst innovation is of
course something we should welcome, YAFS can lead to a great deal of
confusion and frustration when developers just want to start writing an
app but don’t want to manually evaluate 30 different options in order to
select something maintainable. In many cases, the differences between
some of these frameworks can be very subtle if not difficult to
distinguish.

### TodoMVC: A Common Application For Learning And Comparison

There’s been a huge boom in the number of such MV\* frameworks being
released over the past few years.

[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org), [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com),
[AngularJS](http://angularjs.com), [Spine](http://spinejs.com),
[CanJS](http://canjs.us) … The list of new and stable solutions
continues to grow each week and developers can quickly find themselves
lost in a sea of options. From minds who have had to work on complex
applications that inspired these solutions (such as [Yehuda
Katz](http://github.com/wycats) and [Jeremy
Ashkenas](http://github.com/jashkenas)), there are many strong
contenders for what developers should consider using. The question is,
what to use and how do you choose?

We understood this frustration and wanted to help developers simplify
their selection process as much as possible. To help solve this problem,
we created [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) — a project which offers the
same Todo application implemented in most of the popular JavaScript MV\*
frameworks of today — think of it as speed dating for frameworks.
Solutions look and feel the same, have a common feature set, and make it
easy for us to compare the syntax and structure of different frameworks,
so we can select the one we feel the most comfortable with or at least,
narrow down our choices.

![image](http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/screenshot11.jpg "screenshot1")

This week we’re releasing a **brand new** version of
[TodoMVC](http://www.todomvc.com), which you can find more details about
lower down in the apps section.

In the near future we want to take this work even further, providing
guides on how frameworks differ and recommendations for which options to
consider for particular types of applications you may wish to build.

### Our Suggested Criteria For Selecting A Framework

Selecting a framework is of course about more than simply comparing the
Todo app implementations. This is why, once we’ve filtered down our
selection of potential frameworks to just a few, it’s recommend to spend
some time doing a little due diligence. The framework we opt for may
need to support building non-trivial features and could end up being
used to maintain the app for years to come.

-   **What is the framework really capable of?**\
     Spend time reviewing both the source code of the framework and
    official list of features to see how well they fit with your
    requirements. There will be projects that may require modifying or
    extending the underlying source and thus make sure that if this
    might be the case, you’ve performed due diligence on the code.
-   **Has the framework been proved in production?**\
     i.e Have developers actually built and deployed large applications
    with it that are publicly accessible? Backbone has a strong
    portfolio of these (SoundCloud, LinkedIn) but not all frameworks do.
    Ember is used in number of large apps, including the user tools in
    Square. JavaScriptMVC has been used to power applications at IBM
    amongst other places. It’s not only important to know that a
    framework works in production, but also being able to look at real
    world code and be inspired by what can be built with it.
-   **Is the framework mature?**\
     We generally recommend developers don’t simply “pick one and go
    with it”. New projects often come with a lot of buzz surrounding
    their releases but remember to take care when selecting them for use
    on a production-level app. You don’t want to risk the project being
    canned, going through major periods of refactoring or other breaking
    changes that tend to be more carefully planned out when a framework
    is mature. Mature projects also tend to have more detailed
    documentation available, either as a part of their official or
    community-driven docs.
-   **Is the framework flexible or opinionated?**\
     Know what flavor you’re after as there are plenty of frameworks
    available which provide one or the other. Opinionated frameworks
    lock (or suggest) you to do things in a specific way (theirs). By
    design they are limiting, but place less emphasis on the developer
    having to figure out how things should work on their own.
-   **Have you really played with the framework?**\
     Write a small application without using frameworks and then attempt
    to refactor your code with a framework to confirm whether it’s easy
    to work with or not. As much as researching and reading up on code
    will influence your decision, it’s equally as important to write
    actual code using the framework to make sure you’re comfortable with
    the concepts it enforces.
-   **Does the framework have a comprehensive set of documentation?**\
     Although demo applications can be useful for reference, you’ll
    almost always find yourself consulting the official framework docs
    to find out what its API supports, how common tasks or components
    can be created with it and what the gotchas worth noting are. Any
    framework worth it’s salt should have a detailed set of
    documentation which will help guide developers using it. Without
    this, you can find yourself heavily relying on IRC channels, groups
    and self-discovery, which can be fine, but are often overly
    time-consuming when compared to a great set of docs provided
    upfront.
-   **What is the total size of the framework, factoring in
    minification, gzipping and any modular building that it supports?**\
     What dependencies does the framework have? Frameworks tend to only
    list the total filesize of the base library itself, but don’t list
    the sizes of the librarys dependencies. This can mean the difference
    between opting for a library that initially looks quite small, but
    could be relatively large if it say, depends on jQuery and other
    libraries.
-   **Have you reviewed the community around the framework?**\
     Is there an active community of project contributors and users who
    would be able to assist if you run into issues? Have enough
    developers been using the framework that there are existing
    reference applications, tutorials and maybe even screencasts that
    you can use to learn more about it?

### Dojo And Rise Of The JavaScript Frameworks

As many of us know, the [Dojo toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.org) was one
of the first efforts to provide developers a means to developing more
complex applications and some might say it in-part inspired us to think
more about the needs of non-trivial applications. I sat down to ask
Dojos [Dylan Schiemann](http://dylanschiemann.com), Kitson Kelly, and
James Thomas what their thoughts were on the rise of JavaScript MV\*
frameworks.

**Q: Didn’t Dojo already solve all of this? Why hasn’t it been the
dominent solution for developers wishing to build more structured (and
more non-trivial) applications?**

Years ago, while the JavaScript landscape evolved from adding simple
Ajax and chrome to a page, Dojo was evangelizing a “toolkit” approach to
building complex Web applications.

Many of those features were way ahead of most developers needs. With the
emergence of the browser as the dominant application platform, many of
the innovations pioneered in The Dojo Toolkit now appear in newer
toolkits. MVC was just another package that Dojo has provided for quite
some time, along with modular code packages, OO in JS, UI widgets,
cross-browser graphics, templating, internationalization, accessibility,
data stores, testing frameworks, a build system and much, much more.

JavaScript libraries shouldn’t end at “query”, which is why Dojo, early
on, focussed on completing the picture for enterprise grade application
development. This is the same focus that is has today with MVC, it’s
just another “tool in the arsenal”.

Why is Dojo not the dominant toolkit? Its goal was never to be the only
choice. The goal was to provide an open collection of tools that could
be used with anything else, within projects, and liberally copied into
other work as well. Dojo was criticized for being slow and even after
that was addressed, it was criticized for being slow. Trying to shake
that perception is challenging. It is very hard to document a
feature-rich toolkit. There are 175 sub-packages in Dojo 1.8 and over
1,400 modules.

That is not only a challenge from a documentation purpose, it also means
that there isn’t one thing that Dojo does. Which is good if you are
building software, but very difficult when you are starting out trying
to figure out where to start. These are all things we have been trying
to work on for Dojo 1.8, in the form of tutorials and significantly
improved documentation.

**Q: Why should developers still consider Dojo and what ideas do you
have lined up for the future of the project? I hear 1.8 will be another
major milestone.**

In Dojo 1.8, dojox/mvc takes another step towards full maturity. There
has been a lot of investment in time, effort, testing and community
awareness into the package. It focuses on providing an MVC model that
leverages the rest of Dojo. Coupled with dojox/app, an application
framework that is designed to make it easier to build rich applications
across desktop and mobile, it makes a holistic framework for creating a\
 client side application.

In the typical Dojo way, this is just one of many viable ways in which
to build applications with Dojo.

In 1.8, not only does the MVC sub-module become more mature, it is built
upon a robust framework. It doesn’t just give you markup language to
create your views, express your models or develop a controller. It is
far more then just wiring up some controls to a data source. Because it
is leveraging the rest of Dojo, you can draw in anything else you might
need.

In Dojo 2.0 we will be looking to take modularity to a new level, so
that it becomes even easier to take a bit of this and a bit of that and
string it all together. We are also exploring the concepts of
isomorphism, where it should be transparent to the end-user where your
code is being executed, be it client side or server side and that
ultimately it should be transparent to the developer.

### The TodoMVC Collection

In our brand new release, Todo implementations now exist for the most
popular frameworks with a large number of other commonly used frameworks
being worked on in Labs. These implementations have gone through a lot
of revision, often taking on board best practice tips and suggestions
from framework authors, contributors and users from within the
community.

![image](http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/screenshot2.jpg "screenshot2")

Following on from comments previously made by Backbone.js author Jeremey
Ashkenas and Yehuda Katz, TodoMVC now also offers consistent
implementations based on an official application specification as well
as routing (or state management).

We don’t pretend that more complex learning applications aren’t possible
(they certainly are), but the simplicity of a Todo app allows developers
to review areas such as code structure, component syntax and flow, which
we feel are enough to enable a comparison between frameworks and prompt
further exploration with a particular solution or set of solutions.

**Note:** We’ve implemented a version of our Todo application using
[just
JavaScript](https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/blob/master/vanilla-examples/vanillajs/js/app.js)
and another using primarily [jQuery
conventions](https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/blob/master/architecture-examples/jquery/js/app.js).
As you can see, whilst these applications are functionally equivalent to
something you might write with an MVC framework, there’s no separation
of concerns and the code becomes harder to read and maintain as the
codebase grows.

We feel honored that over the past year, some framework authors have
involved us in discussions about how to improve their solutions, helping
bring our experience with a multitude of solutions to the table. We’ve
also slowly moved towards TodoMVC being almost a defacto app that new
frameworks implement and this means it’s become easier to make initial
comparisons when you’re reviewing choices.

### Frameworks: When To Use What?

To help you get started with narrowing down frameworks to explore, we
would like to offer the below high-level framework summaries which we
hope will help steer you towards a few specific options to try out.

I want something flexible which offers a minimalist solution to
separating concerns in my application. It should support a persistence
layer and RESTful sync, models, views (with controllers), event-driven
communication, templating and routing. It should be imperative, allowing
one to update the View when a model changes. I’d like some decisions
about the architecture left up to me. Ideally, many large companies have
used the solution to build non-trivial applications. As I may be
building something complex, I’d like there to be an active extension
community around the framework that have already tried addressing larger
problems
([Marionette](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette),
[Chaplin](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin),
[Aura](https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-aura/),
[Thorax](https://github.com/walmartlabs/thorax)). Ideally, there are
also scaffolding tools
([grunt-bbb](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/grunt-bbb),
[brunch](http://brunch.io/)) available for the solution. **Use
Backbone.js.**

I want something that tries to tackle desktop-level application
development for the web. It should be opinionated, modular, support a
variation of MVC, avoid the need to wire everything in my application
together manually, support persistence, computed properties and have
auto-updating (live) templates. It should support proper state
management rather than the manual routing solution many other frameworks
advocate being used. It should also come with extensive docs and of
course, templating. It should also have scaffolding tools available
(ember.gem, ember for brunch). **Use Ember.js.**

I want something more lightweight which supports live-binding templates,
routing, integration with major libraries (like jQuery and Dojo) and is
optimized for performance. It should also support a way to implement
models, views and controllers. It may not be used on as many large
public applications just yet, but has potential. Ideally, the solution
should be built by people who have previous experience creating many
complex applications. **Use CanJS.**

I want something declarative that uses the View to derive behavior. It
focuses on achieving this through custom HTML tags and components that
specify your application intentions. It should support being easily
testable, URL management (routing) and a separation of concerns through
a variation of MVC. It takes a different approach to most frameworks,
providing a HTML compiler for creating your own DSL in HTML. It may be
inspired by upcoming Web platform features such as Web Components and
also has its own scaffolding tools available (angular-seed). **Use
AngularJS.**

I want something that offers me an excellent base for building large
scale applications. It should support a mature widget infrastructure,
modules which support lazy-loading and can be asynchronous, simple
integration with CDNs, a wide array of widget modules (graphics,
charting, grids, etc) and strong support for internationalization (i18n,
l10n). It should have support for OOP, MVC and the building blocks to
create more complex architectures. **Use Dojo.**

I want something which benefits from the YUI extension infrastructure.
It should support models, views and routers and make it simple to write
multi-view applications supporting routing, View transitions and more.
Whilst larger, it is a complete solution that includes
widgets/components as well as the tools needed to create an organized
application architecture. It may have scaffolding tools (yuiproject),
but these need to be updated. **Use YUI.**

I want something simple that values asynchronous interfaces and lack any
dependencies. It should be opinionated but flexible on how to build
applications. The framework should provide bare-bones essentials like
model, view, controller, events, and routing, while still being tiny. It
should be optimized for use with CoffeeScript and come with
comprehensive documentation. **Use Spine.**

I want something that will make it easy to build complex dynamic UIs
with a clean underlying data model and declarative bindings. It should
automatically update my UI on model changes using two-way bindings and
support dependency tracking of model data. I should be able to use it
with whatever framework I prefer, or even an existing app. It should
also come with templating built-in and be easily extensible. **Use
KnockoutJS.**

I want something that will help me build simple Web applications and
websites. I don’t expect there to be a great deal of code involved and
so code organisation won’t be much of a concern. The solution should
abstract away browser differences so I can focus on the fun stuff. It
should let me easily bind events, interact with remote services, be
extensible and have a huge plugin community. **Use jQuery.**

### What Do Developers Think About The Most Popular Frameworks?

As part of our research into MV\* frameworks for TodoMVC and this
article, we decided to conduct a survey to bring together the
experiences of those using these solutions. We asked developers what
framework they find themselves using the most often and more
importantly, why they would recommend them to others. We also asked what
they felt was still missing in their project of choice.

We’ve grouped some of the most interesting responses below, by
framework.

#### Ember.js

> **Pros:** The combination of live templates and observable objects has
> changed the way I write JavaScript. It can be a bit much to wrap your
> head around at first, but you end up with a nice separation of
> responsibility. I found that once I have everything set up, adding
> fairly complex features only takes a couple lines of code. Without
> Ember, these same features would’ve been hellish to implement.
>
> **Cons:** Ember has yet to reach 1.0. Many things are still in flux,
> such as the router and Ember data. The new website is very helpful,
> but there’s still not as much documentation for Ember as there is for
> other frameworks, specifically Backbone. Also, with so much magic in
> the framework, it can be a little scary. There’s the fear that if
> something breaks you won’t be able to figure out exactly why. Oh, and
> the error messages that ember gives you often suck.

> **Pros:**\
>  The key factors:
>
> \a) Features that let me avoid a lot of boilerplate (bindings,
> computer properties, view layer with the cool handlebars).
>
> \b) the core team: I’m a Rails developer and know the work of Yehuda
> Katz. I trust the guy =)
>
> **Cons:** Documentation. It’s really sad that Ember doesn’t have good
> documentation, tutorials, screencast like Backbone, Angular or other
> frameworks. Right now, we browse the code looking for docs which isn’t
> ideal.

> **Pros:** Convention over configuration. Ember makes so many small
> decisions for you it’s by far the easiest way to build a client-side
> application these days.
>
> **Cons:** The learning curve. It is missing the mass of getting
> started guides that exist for other frameworks like Backbone, this is
> partly because of the small community, but I think more because of the
> state of flux the codebase is in pre-1.0.

> **Pros:** Simplicity, bindings, tight integration with Handlebars,
> ease of enabling modularity in my own code.
>
> **Cons:** I’d like to have a stable integration with ember-data, and
> integrated localStorage support synced with a REST API, but hey that’s
> fantasy that one day will surely come true ;-)

#### Backbone.js

> **Pros:** Simplicity — only 4 core components (Collection, Model,
> View, Router). Huge community (ecosystem) and lots of solutions on
> StackOverflow. Higher order frameworks like Marionette or Vertebrae
> with lots of clever code inside. Somebody might like “low-levelness” —
> need to write lots of boilerplate code, but get customized application
> architecture.
>
> **Cons:** I don’t like how extend method works — it copies content of
> parent objects into new one. Prototypal inheritance FTW. Sometime I
> miss real world scenarios in docs examples. Also there is a lot of
> research needed to figure out how to build a bigger app after reading
> the TODO tutorial.
>
> I’m missing official AMD support in projects from DocumentCloud (BB,
> \_). [Note: this shouldn’t be an issue with the new RequireJS shim()
> method in RequireJS 2.0].

> **Pros:** After the initial brain-warp of understanding how Backbone
> rolls, it is incredibly useful. Useful as in, well supported,
> lightweight, and constantly updated in a valid scope. Ties in with
> natural friends Underscore, jQuery/Zepto, tools that most of my
> studio’s projects would work with.
>
> **Cons:** The amount of tutorials on how to do things with Backbone is
> inconsistent and at different periods of Backbones lifespan. I’ve
> asked other devs to have a look at Backbone, and they would be writing
> code for v0.3. Un-aware. Whilst not a problem Backbone can fix itself,
> it is certainly a major dislike associated with the framework.
>
> I suppose in theory, you could apply this to anything else, but,
> Backbone is a recurrent one in my eyes. Hell, I’ve even seen month old
> articles using ancient Backbone methods and patterns.
>
> Whatever dislikes I would have on the framework strictly itself, has
> been rectified by the community through sensible hacks and approaches.
> For me, that is why Backbone is great, the community backing it up.

> **Pros:** Provides just enough abstraction without unreasonable
> opinions — enabling you to tailor it to the needs of the project.
>
> **Cons:** I would re-write (or possibly remove) Backbone.sync. It has
> baked in assumptions of typical client-initiated HTTP communications,
> and doesn’t adapt well to the push nature of WebSockets.

> **Pros:** It’s extremely easy to get into, offering a nice gateway to
> MV\* based frameworks. It’s relatively customizable and there are also
> tons of other people using it, making finding help or support easy.
>
> **Cons:** The fact that there’s no view bindings by default (although
> you can fix this). Re-rendering the whole view when a single property
> changes is wasteful.
>
> The RESTful API has a lot of positives, but the lack of bulk-saving
> (admittedly a problem with REST itself, but still) and the difficulty
> in getting different URI schemes to work on different types of
> operations sucks.

#### AngularJS

> **Pros:**
>
> \a) 2-way data binding is incredibly powerful. You tend to think more
> about your model and the state that it is in instead of a series of
> events that need to happen. The model is the single source of truth.
>
> \b) Performance. AngularJS is a small download. It’s templating uses
> DOM nodes instead of converting strings into DOM nodes and should
> perform better.
>
> \c) If you are targeting modern browsers and/or are a little careful,
> you can drop jQuery from your dependencies too.
>
> **Cons:** I’d like to be able to specify transitions for UI state
> changes that propgate from a model change. Specifically for elements
> that use ng-show or ng-hide I’d like to use a fade or slide in in an
> easy declarative way.

> **Pros:** It’s very intuitive, has excellent documentation. I love
> their data binding approach, HTML based views, nested scopes. I
> switched from Backbone/Thorax to Angular and never looked back. A new
> Chrome extension Batarang integrates with Chrome Developer’s Tools and
> provides live access the Angular data structures.
>
> **Cons:** I’d like to have a built-in support to such functions as
> drag’n'drop, however this can be added using external components
> available on GitHub. I’d also like to see more 3rd party components
> available for reuse. I think it’s just a matter of time for the
> ecosystem around AngularJS to get more mature and then these will be
> available just like they are in communities like jQuery.

> **Pros:** It minimizes drastically the boilerplate code, allows for
> nice code reuse through components, extends the HTML syntax so that
> many complex features end up being as simple as applying a directive
> (attribute) in the HTML, and is super-easily testable thanks to a full
> commitment to dependency injection.\
>  You can write a non-trivial app without jQuery or without directly
> manipulating the DOM. That’s quite a feat.
>
> **Cons:** Its learning curve is somewhat steeper than Backbone (which
> is quite easy to master), but the gain is appreciative. Documentation
> could be better.

#### KnockoutJS

> **Pros:** I don’t necessarily use it *all* the time, but KnockoutJS is
> just fantastic for single page applications. Extremely easy
> subscribing to live sorting; much better API for so called “collection
> views” in Backbone using observable arrays. And custom event on
> observables for effects, etc.
>
> **Cons:** Feel like the API is quite hard to scale, and would probably
> prefer to wrangle Backbone on the bigger applications. (But that’s
> also partially due to community support).

> **Pros:** I like the data binding mechanism and feel very comfortable
> using it. In particular I like how they have replaced templates with
> control flow binding.
>
> **Cons:** I don’t like that there is no guidance or best practice in
> terms of application structure. Aside from having a view model, the
> framework doesn’t help you in defining a well structured view model.
> It’s very easy to end up with a large unmaintainable function.

#### Dojo

> **Pros:** Syntactically, Dojo is very simple. It allows for dynamic
> and robust builds, with the initial loader file being as low as 6k in
> some cases. It is AMD compatible, making it extremely portable, and
> comes out-of-the-box with a ton of features ranging from basic dom
> interactions to complex SVG, VML, and canvas functionality. The widget
> system, Dijit, is unmatched in it’s ease-of-use and ability to be
> extended. It’s a very well-rounded and complete toolkit.\
>  **Cons:** The dojo/\_base/declare functionality is not 100% strict
> mode compliant and there is currently some overhead due to backwards
> compatibility, though this will mostly go away in the Dojo 2.0
> release.

> **Pros:** Good components : tabs, datagrid, formManager… Renders the
> same cross browser. AMD compliant. Easy to test with mocks.Integrates
> well with other frameworks thks to amd (I ll integrate with JMVC)\
>  **Cons:** Default design for components out of fashion. Not fully
> html5. So-so documentation\
>  Poor templating system (no auto binding).

#### YUI

> **Pros:** YUI3 is a modular and use-at-will type of component library
> which includes all of the goodies of Backbone and more. It even (in my
> opinion) improves upon some of the concepts in Backbone by de-coupling
> some things (i.e. attribute is a separate module that can be mixed
> into any object – the event module can be mixed in similarly).
>
> **Cons:** I’d love to see YUI3 support some of the auto-wiring
> (optional) of Ember. I think that is really the big win for Ember;
> otherwise, I see YUI3 as a superior component library where I can
> cherry-pick what I need. I’d also like to see a more AMD-compatible
> module loader. The loader today works very well; however, it would be
> nicer if I could start a new projects based on AMD modules and pull in
> certain YUI3 components and other things from other places that are
> also using AMD.

#### JavascriptMVC

> **Pros:** Has all tools included, just need to run commands and start
> building. I have used for the last 6 months and it’s been really good.
>
> **Cons:** The only thing I would do is to speed up development of the
> next version. Developers are aware of problems and fixing issues but
> its going to be another ¾ months before some issues I want fixed are
> addressed, but then I could probably patch and do a pull request.

#### Maria

> **Pros:** Because Maria is a pure MVC framework that is focused on
> being just an MVC framework. No more and no less. Its clean and
> simple.
>
> **Cons:** A little more usage documentation outside of the source
> code, plus a few more test cases. A tutorial that drives home the real
> use of MVC with Maria would be good too.

#### Cujo.js

> **Pros:** Real apps almost never fit perfectly into an MV\* box, and
> the most important stuff is often outside the box. With cujo.js, you
> define the box.
>
> Yes, cujo.js has high-level MV\*-like features for creating views,
> models, controllers, etc., but every app is different, and no
> framework can ever be a 100% solution. Rather than try to be all
> things, cujo.js also provides lower level tools, architectural
> plumbling, and a rich plugin system that can even be used to integrate
> and extend other MV\* frameworks.
>
> Create the architecture that best suits your application, rather than
> constraining your app to fit inside someone else’s predefined
> architecture.
>
> **Cons:** The broader JavaScript community is totally unprepared and
> untrained to take on large-scale applications. Most of us don’t even
> know that design patterns and architectural patterns exist.
>
> Since cujo.js is so different from other frameworks, it needs more
> than a simple API reference and code snippets. Without tutorials,
> educational materials, and step-by-step examples, cujo.js might look
> strange and overwhelming to the untrained eye but documentation is
> supposed to be coming soon.

#### ExtJS

> **Pros:** I think ExtJS works best in combination with Ext Designer.
> It gives it an edge beyond the other GUI frameworks by letting
> non-programmers mock up the UI so programmers can fill in the blanks.
> I think comparing it to MVC frameworks like Backbone doesn’t do it
> justice – its strength lies in creating rich GUIs, not lean Web apps.
>
> For rich, commercial back-office applications I think ExtJS remains
> the best choice when it comes to JavaScript solutions (i.e. not GWT
> etc). For public-facing Web apps I’d rather have something that gives
> me more control over the markup (and ideally something that degrades
> gracefully).
>
> **Cons:** It has a steeper learning curve than many of the other
> modern structural frameworks. One can argue that if you’re investing
> in ExtJS for the long-term this time spent learning will pay off,
> however I think solutions like it should aim to better minimize the
> time it takes to train teams up in using it.

> **Pros:** I think a big feature of ExtJS 4 is that it throws you into
> the MVC mindset and the preferred filesystem structure right from the
> bat. With Dojo the initial tutorials seem to be mostly about
> augmenting existing websites whereas ExtJS assumes you’re starting
> from scratch.
>
> Using ExtJS doesn’t really “feel” like you’re dealing with HTML at
> all. The component library is rich enough to let you go a long way
> without touching more HTML than what is needed to bootstrap your app.
>
> It’d be interesting to see how both compare when Web components become
> more widely supported. This would finally allow manipulating the DOM
> without being afraid of breaking any widgets or causing your app’s
> internal state to become inconsistent.
>
> **Cons:** The licensing is considered restrictive and difficult to
> understand by some. More people would be investing in ExtJS if it was
> clearer what the upfront and long-term costs of using it are. This
> isn’t a concern with some other structural solutions but probably
> isn’t as much a worry for larger businesses.

> **Pros:** ExtJS is a fantastic package for rapidly building out RIAs
> for internal use. I for one, love to build with HTML and JavaScript,
> and for me there’s great satisfaction in mucking around at that level.
> Even though ExtJS makes it feel like you’re not really working with
> HTML it still offers a great deal of power, especially if you’re using
> it to create a complex UI.
>
> **Cons:** That said…I absolutely agree that it’s very heavy and I

#### Batman

### Don’t Be Afraid To Experiment

Whilst it’s unlikely for a developer to need to learn how to use more
than a handfull of these frameworks, I do encourage exploration of those
you’re unfamiliar with. There’s more than mountain of interesting facts
and techniques that can be learned in this process.

In my case: I discovered that Batman.js required the least hand-written
lines of code for an implementation. I’m neither a frequent CoffeeScript
nor Batman.js user but that in itself gave me some food for thought.
Perhaps I could take some of what made this possible and bring it over
to the frameworks I do use. Or, maybe I’d simply use Batman.js in a
future project if I found the community and support around it improved
over time.

Regardless of whether you end up using a different solution, at the end
of the day all you have to gain from exploration is more knowledge about
what’s out there.

### Going Beyond MV\* Frameworks

Whilst the MV\* family of patterns are quite popular for structuring
applications, they’re limited in that they don’t address any kind of
application layer, communication between Views, services that perform
work or anything else. Developers may thus find that they sometimes need
to explore beyond just MVC — there are times when you absolutely need to
take what they have to offer further.

We reached out to developers that have been taking MVC further with
their own patterns or extensions for existing frameworks to get some
insights on where you need something more.

“In my case, I needed something Composite. I noticed that there were
patterns in Backbone apps where developers realized there was a need for
an object that coordinated various parts of an application. Most of the
time, I’ve seen developers try to solve this using a Backbone construct
(e.g a View), even when there isn’t really a need for it. This is why I
instead explored the need for an [Application
Initializer](http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/12/16/composite-javascript-applications-with-backbone-and-backbone-marionette/).

I also found that MVC didn’t really describe a way to handle regions of
a page or application. The gist of [region
management](http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/12/12/composite-js-apps-regions-and-region-managers/)
is that you could define a visible area of the screen and build out the
most basic layout for it without knowing what content was going to be
displayed in it at runtime.

I created solutions for region management, application initialization
and more in my extension project Marionette. It’s one of a number of
solutions that extend upon a framework (or architecture pattern) that
developers end up needing when they’re building single-page applications
that are relatively complex.

There’s even a TodoMVC [Marionette
app](https://github.com/derickbailey/todomvc/tree/marionette) available
for anyone wishing to compare the standard Backbone application with one
that goes beyond just MV\*.

*Derick Bailey — Author of Marionette*

“While a good portion of problems can be decomposed into JavaScript MVC,
there are some which simply cannot. For example, an application consumes
a third party API at runtime, but is not given any information as to how
the data will be structured.

I spent almost a year trying to solve that very problem, but eventually
I came to the realization that shoehorning it into MV\* was not a viable
solution. I was dealing with an “amorphous model” and that’s where it
all fell apart. In other words, if you don’t have a well-defined model,
most modern JavaScript frameworks can’t help you.

That’s where [Core J2EE
Pat­terns](http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/)
come in. I got turned on to them while read­ing [PHP Objects, Pat­terns,
and
Prac­tice](http://www.amazon.com/Objects-Patterns-Practice-Matt-Zandstra/dp/1590599098)
by Matt Zand­stra, and I’m glad I did! The J2EE Patterns basically
outline a request-driven process, where the URL drives the behavior of
the application. In a nutshell, a request is created, modified, and then
used to determine the view to render.

I’ve expanded on my experiences with [request driven Javascript
applications and J2EE patterns](http://dblogit.com/archives/3895) for
anyone who would like to learn more. ”

### Conclusions

While there are several choices for what to use for structuring your
JavaScript Web applications these days, it’s important to be
**diligent** in the selection process – spend time thoroughly evaluating
your options in order to make a decision which results in
sustainable,**maintainable** code. Framework diversity fosters
innovation, while too much similarity just creates noise.

Projects like TodoMVC can help narrow down your selections to those you
feel might be the most interesting or most comfortable for a particular
project. Remember to take your time choosing, don’t feel too constrained
by using a specific pattern and keep in mind that it’s completely
acceptable to build on the solution you select to best fit the needs of
your application.

Experimenting with different frameworks will also give you different
views on how to solve common problems which will in turn make you a
better programmer.

    Thanks Addy! Great article! It gives a very good overview about the
    existing MV\* frameworks. And I really like your «What Is MVC, Or
    Rather MV\*?» intro, as it makes clear, that the purpose is mainly
    for single-page applications with the need for client-side models
    and would be overkill for most «traditional» – eg. CMS related –
    stuff. Btw: there are other frameworks – eg. TerrificJS – that are
    built especially for the latter case.

        Not at all. You mentioned TerrificJS – one of our goals for the
        next version of TodoMVC will be tackling frameworks that go a
        little futher. There are quite a few now tackling real-time
        development or full end to end stacks (SocketStream, Meteor etc)
        and more looking at complex modular architectures (TerrificJS,
        Chaplin, Aura). We want to try helping developers compare these
        solutions as easily as possible too, so watch this space!.

    Thanks for the round up, Addy. Do you have any recommendation for a
    book or tutorial that explains how to go from jQuery to Backbone
    using what you feel are Backbone’s best practices? When I look at
    the Backbone examples there are lots of different implementations
    but I want to know what costly architecture mistakes to avoid at the
    beginning for a large web app.

            I would happily recommend the article in Tobis reply above
            by Kim Joar Bekkelund. I was reviewing it yesterday and it
            appears to be a good fit for developers wishing to build on
            their jQuery foundations and really get stuck into Backbone.
            Once you’ve had a chance to read it, you might also be
            interested in Backbone Fundamentals

    From an architectural point of view, inst it a bit too much to move
    MVC from say the server platform (PHP, .NET, JSP) to the client in
    JavaScript? I’m sure you can do crazy things in JavaScript but was
    it meant to? Also how about the implications of the added download
    file sizes, etc.

        What we’re finding these days is that there are a growing number
        of developers creating complex web applications that are
        primarily based in the browser (i.e you have a JavaScript client
        communicating with a server-side API just for data). These
        applications are non-trivial enough (GMail is always a great
        example) that separating out their concerns almost always helps
        improve maintainability. In this light, I don’t think that
        architectural patterns like MVC are overkill, but we do have to
        be careful how and where we use them.

        The implications on download file size are that developers have
        to make decisions about when their users will have to download
        the ‘payload’ of scripts. Some applications (like Google Docs)
        take a dynamic approach to this, only making users download the
        bare minimum set of scripts for common functionality initially,
        but then pulling in other scripts (for things like the formula
        editor) when you select that option from the menu. Other
        applications just ask users to download most of the scripts when
        you first fire them up and you do have to keep performance and
        speed in mind.

        No one wants to be downloading 2MB of JavaScript unnecessarily.

        I have the same question come up from devs of whom I support. I
        totally agree. MVC needs to be handled by the server-side folks.
        My problem with most javascript people on the web is that they
        don’t really know how to code, and rely solely on JQuery and
        other libraries to do it. The article above makes matters worse
        by adding a layer of MVC to the mix. This becomes a problem when
        you have enterprise logic laced with 3rd party proprietary code
        where its founders clearly have their own agenda.

            Prejudice much? Just because most of the “Javascript people”
            that you don’t know how to code (according to you, at
            least), doesn’t mean the there is great coders out there who
            knows how to write great code. I guess you just need to get
            out a bit, get some fresh air and meet more interesting
            people, you know – those who can write great codes doesn’t
            matter what the language they use. Those people do exist, I
            can attest to that.

            Seriously man, whats up with that? Does that even mean
            something? These libraries are open source, and quite a
            number of them are just libraries, its up to you to dictate
            your own architecture and layers. Yes, layers, we do know
            how layer our apps as needed. Shocking, I know.

        I feel you. There’s a challenge of choice, I agree, but thinking
        more about the architecture needed for JavaScript-heavy apps. is
        a necessary part of the evolution of how we write web
        applications these days – perhaps this is easier for teams where
        there are specific developers working on the frontend and
        backend?.

        Users prefer speed and snappiness over complete page reloads and
        bringing more of the UI logic to the browser means these speed
        improvements are more easily possible – these frameworks just
        help ensure the architecture of these UIs remains maintainable.
        If you also consider more advanced needs, like offline-support
        and more specifically, offline-sync, backend only code is only
        able to go so far with the needs of todays UIs.

        My advice to start with is not to mull over it too much and pick
        a library with good documentation and start a project with it.
        After that, if you find yourself craving the features of another
        MV library you will find it is not hard to jump over and learn
        it for your next project.

    I’ve used JMVC and Knockoutjs quite a bit. Of the two I have
    preferred JMVC. I love the event based architecture, generators
    (rails devs will be right at home) and the funcunit testing
    framework that’s bundled along with it.

    Slightly perturbed about the emergence of CanJS though. I still
    can’t work out if it’s supposed to be an alternative or sucessor to
    JMVC.

        I remember speaking to Justin Meyer (one of the core developers
        behind CanJS and JavaScriptMVC) sometime ago and my
        understanding was that CanJS was meant to be a leaner version of
        JMVC that could be considered an alternative to lighter MV\*
        frameworks such as Backbone.js. A newer project, Done.js would
        ultimately replace JMVC (but offer most/all of it’s
        capabilities) but that’s probably still a short while away.
        Jupiter/Bitovi have always tried doing well by their users and
        if you enjoy JMVC, I would ask them about Done.js and how soon
        that might be available.

    It was really difficult for me to get into backbone.js and I would
    probably had gave it up if I wasn’t forced to but it’s really paying
    off and I trully reccomend it for every front end developer. There
    is a free ebook available if you search google that helped me a lot.
    Ember.js seems cool and I might give it a try.\

    Under “Frameworks: When To Use What?” is the description for angular
    mixed up? Looks like the framework before ang has the ang
    description.

    This is incredibly helpful and useful. Thanks so much for your input
    and especially the ebook on Javascript design patterns! You’re the
    type of person that helps push Javascript towards a better maturity
    that’s not just copying other languages.

        Hi. There wasn’t a mix up but I think the positioning of the
        recommendation text below the framework summaries may have given
        this impression. I updated the article to make this more clear.

    I agree with the con for knockout in that the viewmodel begins to
    feel like a large function but i found with the combination of
    requirejs and being able to bind multiple viewmodels to partial
    views on the page really helps make a complex ui much more
    maintainable. Thank you so much for this write-up I’m definitely
    going to share this w/ my friends.

    Great article. I can see the benefits of having so much choice but
    it would be good if there was a widely enough adopted MV framework
    that it would become a first choice option when building web apps,
    the same way in which JQuery has become a standard choice (well for
    myself anyway). Sometimes too much choice can be a bad thing.

        You’re absolutely spot on with questioning the merits of having
        so many options available. I think in the case of JavaScript
        MV\* frameworks, there’s still a great deal of uncertainty about
        what the best (or right) way to approach structure is, which is
        why so many developers try to offer their own take on this.

        I think that in time, once the adoption rates of a few specific
        frameworks improve we’ll move closer and closer to convergence.
        I don’t see there being just one single framework that’s
        recommended for use, but perhaps fewer than a hand-full that the
        community at large consider \*the\* right options.

    Awww, i have spent so much time evaluating over a lot of these
    frameworks. And if you finaly choose one for the job, you have this
    feeling in the back of your head, is this tool really the
    appropriate one.\
     I find myself often switch framework if i get stuck on something i
    don’t like, instead of investigating deeper.

        Is there a framework you find yourself using more often than the
        others? Sometimes it’s better to invest time in writing
        utilities that build upon what you commonly use rather than
        regularly switching between a few solutions (which probably have
        their own learning curve required to use them).

    Once again Addy, nicely done. More explaining and less “Build
    Twitter with \* ” articles are an excellent resource for the
    community. We need these ones every now and then. The sheer choice
    to frameworks is ridiculous, becoming a haunting ultimatum for
    choosing your Christmas present as a child. Just one pick.

    TodoMVC is an awesome resource. I hope it continues to grow.

    I’d be curious to see 3 more attributes for selection:

    1st, whether the framework can be incrementally adopted or requires
    full adoption. For instance, I have an existing application with
    traditional page-request model. I’d like to use an MV\*-like
    approach to first create some rich widgets, taking advantage of
    component model-view data binding, recommended AJAX methods, etc.
    I’ll eventually go on to take full advantage of the power of the
    framework, including routing for sub-parts of the site. I believe
    that Backbone is fine for this (just ignore Routers at first) and
    obviously something full-stack like Meteor is ruled out, but I don’t
    yet understand whether all the excellent options you included might
    also work for me.

    2nd, whether the framework can live side-by-side with existing
    JQuery components or standalone JQuery code. In my opinion there’s
    too much good stuff happening in the wider JQuery community to
    commit to a framework that makes it difficult to adopt components
    individually. And it’s not just a matter of making sure that the
    underlying DOM isn’t dynamic/obscured, it also has to be careful
    about aggressively refreshing parts of the page, etc. There’s a
    middle ground where you can – without modifying the component’s
    source – write a little external scaffolding code to trigger
    framework sync events.

    3rd, less important but also interesting, is compatibility with
    popular server-side frameworks. Is it easy to apply a particular
    framework on top of WordPress, Drupal, Django, Rails, whatever? I
    suspect that many of these are designed specifically for Rails but
    would require some server-side adapters for usage in PHP, etc. If
    this is already done, it’s likely due to community adoption as much
    as technical effort on the framework developers.

    Thanks for a really useful article!

        I call your first criterion “augmentation”, the ability to
        augment existing sites or apps. One of the dev quotes mentions
        Dojo being able to tackle that use case, and KnockoutJS also
        gets a mention for that above: “I should be able to use it with
        whatever framework I prefer, or even an existing app”.

        I haven’t seen much about your third criterion, except some
        tutorials on coupling a server-side framework, used strictly to
        provide a REST API, with a client-side MVC framework. eg, Django
        + TastyPie (an excellent REST framework) + Backbone.js. The REST
        part is easy, but that doesn’t really deal with refreshes, AMD,
        and other integration problems one would encounter in a hybrid
        app.

    Hi Addy, first of all, great article. You should receive an award
    for this, made my day. You had me at the explanation on what should
    I use and why.\
     I have a question, though.. we’ve seen companies like twitter
    backing down from client-side rendering because of performance
    issues (apparently, all the resources were being loaded on the
    fly..?) and constantly I read that many devs are building apps this
    way and leaving the body tag without a single piece of information,
    resulting in bad SEO.\
     What’s your hunch about that? Sorry if I wasn’t clear enough.

        I think that it’s important to factor in the context of the
        application. There will be many apps on the web for which making
        a call on how you’re serving your Views will factor in
        performance moreso than SEO – e.g if you take GMail or GDocs,
        those are affectively authenticated personal apps with no need
        to worry about the Googlebot seeing what’s in the body tag. If
        you’re Twitter, Facebook or another type of application where
        your content needs to be indexed by search engines, absolutely
        go for the option that balances perf and SEO the most optimally.

    Regarding JMVC, what features need to get fixed? Any feature in JMVC
    that needs to get fixed is almost certainly not even in the other
    frameworks. The only “tricky” thing I’m aware of is packages
    implicit dependency problem. But, packages is unreleased feature.

    Thanks for the excellent tour de JS MVC and related frameworks. I am
    a long time ExtJS user delving into the new lighter weight offerings
    (backbone.js and angular.js in particular) and it’s great to get the

    Thanks for the nice read with full of information. Your post has
    made the whole new Javascript concept crystal clear. You have real

    One thing i would like to know is the scale of complexity each
    framework can accomplish. For Eg. Can backbone create something
    massive like Google Docs? Dojo can (I think). Ember says it is for
    creating “ambitious web application”. The example on the site for a
    helpdesk doesn’t look ambitious to me. Perhaps it is underneath.

    A warning for every framework would be nice like “Not for massive
    applications stay small or medium size”

    Hi Addy

    I am also wondering how you fell google’s closure library fits into
    this (given you work for google). I understand it does not have data
    binding and is a library of controls and utilities so I imagine it
    is something that could be used in combination with one of these
    ‘mvc-ish’ frameworks. Perhaps you could ask around at google who has
    done so.

    I guess I would also like someone to do a similar round-up comparing
    HTML5 boilerplate, bootstrap, jQueryUi / jQuery Mobile, closure and
    also this new one
    ([http://keyholesoftware.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/montage/](http://keyholesoftware.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/montage/))

    …AND some advice on how well these work together to provide
    lightweight web apps that adapt well to different devices.

    Then again I expect this will come from the Yeoman project team when
    they come to explain the choices of their chosen components?

    Hello.\
     Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think, backbone.js has prototypal
    inheritance. It’s Model.extend() is not a shortcut to Underscore.js
    \_.extend(), which does copy object attributes. Check this out
    [https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js\#L1323](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L1323)
    with their “inheritrs()” helper.

    “There certainly are complex Web applications where the partial
    rendering of views can\* be coupled with a single-page application
    effectively, …”

    I really like what you are doing with Aura. But I am having a
    difficult time migrating my understanding of it into the above
    scenario. Is the can-asterik in your sentence essentially a footnote
    that “it may be too difficult?” The php-based CMS I am using manages
    a lot of documents and ties a large user/club relationship
    association together, but developing a single page js api within a
    CMS page would really help the UI experience. (So I’m hoping your
    answer is: “it’s easy!”) :)

    Are you far off from showing a more complex Aura example (which you
    state is an intention of yours) ? The Aura TODO example you give
    does not use routes and I could use it. :)

    Finally, “Thank you.” In trying to take my technical skills into the
    web I have had to read enormous amounts of information. Your
    writings are some of the best (if not “the best”). And in my view,
    how you have built a decoupled, widget-based api with a mediator
    pattern is excellent and I can see it safeguarding my investment in
    learning it (due to it’s modularity) compared to other JS
    frameworks.

    I was always confused about knockout and backbone, because I have
    study both of these.but you cleared my mind.

    I have create some projects with knockout.js, because its simple and

    Sorry but I don’t understand the purpose of all this JS MVC
    frameworks. Isn’t the DOM already MVC?\
     It looks like these frameworks implement a lot of useless
    abstractions.\
     Just have a look at the JQuery+Handlebars version of the TodoMVC
    application. It contains 10 times less artifacts than any other
    versions.\
     In fact you don’t have to put all your control logic in one big js
    file. You can split it vertically by use cases in multiple files.\
     You can also separate event binding logic from the control logic
    itself.\
     I don’t read here any arguments (execpt the obvious ‘Don’t write
    spaghetti code’) in favour of these frameworks?!\
     So what can I do with these MVC frameworks that I can NOT do with
    JQuery (and plugins) that justify the use of the heavy abstractions
    provided by them?

    Hi,

    Something I’ve posted on forums to not much response, but this seems
    like a good place for it :)

    NB: I’m coming from an MVC.Net perspective, so when I say MVC here
    please bear that in mind.

    Here’s my dilemma. I want all the goodness of controllers, I want
    strongly typed views and model binding – basically all the best bits
    of MVC.Net. However, even a fairly simple page will require some
    client side script for showing\\hiding elements, confirmation boxes
    & all that funky stuff that users expect for todays interactive web
    pages. You normally end up with ‘page specific script’ which will be
    a number of event handlers and bindings, with no real structure as
    such.

    The way Backbone, Knockout etc are designed almost relegates MVC.Net
    to a simple ‘web API’ to handle RESTful requests and respond with
    some JSON. You seem to end up moving logic that \*I believe\* should
    be in the ‘server side controller’ into a ‘script controller’, which
    I’m not really happy with (because I’m primarily a .Net developer!).
    Like you have mentioned, this is fine in something like GMail, where
    the majority of the application is on the client.

    I want: a structured script representation of my Model, that allows
    me to wire up all my client event handlers for my View and keeps
    everything in a logical order. But I still want model binding, data
    annotations, validation and logic in my .Net controller, everything
    I want handled by MVC.Net. I want the best of both in other words :)

    How I want this to work – MVC should render the view and use
    strongly typed model binding. A script that represents the view in
    some way (that I don’t have to write manually to replicate my server
    model) should automagically take over on the client to handle any
    dynamic events, allow me to manipulate the state on the client and
    then submit the form back to the controller using a standard POST.

    Most of the applications I’m working on at the moment are Line Of
    Business, but they can still have some fairly complex client side
    functionality. I’m not using any framework at the moment, I’m just
    namespacing my script and wrapping up some jQuery (i.e. Javascript
    modular pattern) … it works, just not sure if it’s the best way to
    be doing things. I’m interested how others developing in MVC are
    addressing this?

    Any thoughts appreciated

    Anyway, Implementing MVC on both client and server doesn’t make
    sense. I will still go with full stack MVC on the server end.

    Thanks Addy for this fantastic piece of work.\
     I’m an early Dojo adopter that switched to jQuery later on. Since
    then I was thinking about switching back, mainly to have a proper
    template and MV\* tools. but this article showed me that there are
    many tools I can use keeping jQuery and jQueryUI around.\
     I added CanJS, KnockoutJS and AngularJS to my list, any
    suggestions?\
     Thanks again.

        One thing that is very important, which I only see referenced
        here in passing, is the accessibility of common control types,
        which has a huge impact on user experience, contract
        procurements, marketability, and many other aspects.

        There is a Bootstrapping library available at\
         [http://whatsock.com/bootstrap](http://whatsock.com/bootstrap)\
         That can be used to create accessible interactive components
        using semantic HTML markup, which may help with this.

        As an FYI, it is a misconception that ARIA will make things
        accessible. If the keyboard functionality of interactive
        components doesn’t precisely match the ARIA attributes applied
        to them, then these components will not work accessibly. I’ve
        recently seen this with GWT, and in many other places.

    Addy, any chance that you and the “we” that is your TodoMVC team
    might cover Sencha? We’re using 3.4 where I am (though there are
    more recent versions). I’m totally new to MVC and I’m having a tough
    time with making anything work in Sencha.

    Hi Addy

    I started my career as a Web Designer using photoshop, flash. But
    from last 2.5 years I diverted my career from designer to developer.
    I learned jquery and little bit javascript also.\
     Presently working in singleton pattern only.\
     I am planning to use js framework in my current project. But the
    same problem is that how to choose the best one.\
     I am new in these frameworks, except knows only jquery. I have gone
    through some of them i.e. knockoutjs, emberjs. but their syntax and
    coding is different as I couldn’t understand. Although I am learning
    through e-books and youtube videos also.

    Please suggest me one which is easier to learn and implement in my
    current project.

    Hi,

    I recently developed a tiny JavaScript MVC framework based of just a
    few JS files. It’s features consist off easily extensible classes,
    autoloader and a tiny footprint.

    I have to say, when we went to write our app, we thought long and
    hard about what frontend framework to use. There were so many
    options. Many had been experimented with on the company’s various
    products. The write-ups weren’t helpful in choosing one. All we knew
    is we didn’t like what we’d seen. In the end, we decided not to use
    one and it has really made all the difference.

    Hi !\
     Thanks a lot for this article.

    A question : to create a desktop app with web technos. What do you
    think about using :\
     HTML5\
     + MV\* Framework to structure : AngularJs OR EmberJs ?\
     + Package the application into a native Desktop app : TideSDK or
    Brackets-Shell ?

    According to you, which solution is the best ?

    This is definitely one of the better and perhaps least biased
    articles I’ve read. I think a lot of developers write their own
    frameworks because the ones available don’t necessarily do what they
    want. Too complicated oddly structured want templates don’t want
    templates want mvc don’t want mvc only want feature x and y but not
    a-k etc. Of all the frameworks on the net I investigated over 30 to
    see if any did what I wanted and although I could have gotten away
    with a couple of them it would have been a bit messy or difficult. I
    wont say they are bad because many of them are extremely
    professionally made – but seem to be less generic the bulkier they
    get. I did like in particular RappidJS and Angular. I thought
    underscore and backbone were also exceptional. However I still ended
    up creating RapidOS (examples
    [http://www.youtube.com/webrenovators](http://www.youtube.com/webrenovators))
    for the reasons I mentioned. We may create the basic todo app but
    their guidelines almost all exclude the way we do things even such
    as routing which to us will open a new window.

    Our Vanilla example is not meant to demonstrate MVC (neither is the
    jQuery one). They’re there to show developers how a non-MVC
    application without the decoupling of concerns would manifest so
    they can see how to take say, spaghetti code and turn it into
    something more organized. The closest thing we have to true MVC is
    possibly the Maria.js implementation, but we’ll be happy to take a
    look at what you’ve put together!

    Prejudice much? Just because most of the “Javascript people” that
    you don’t know how to code (according to you, at least), doesn’t
    mean the there is great coders out there who knows how to write
    great code. I guess you just need to get out a bit, get some fresh
    air and meet more interesting people, you know – those who can write
    great codes doesn’t matter what the language they use. Those people
    do exist, I can attest to that.

    \> “This becomes a problem when you have enterprise logic laced with
    3rd party proprietary code where its founders clearly have their own
    agenda.”

    Seriously man, whats up with that? Does that even mean something?
    These libraries are open source, and quite a number of them are just
    libraries, its up to you to dictate your own architecture and
    layers. Yes, layers, we do know how layer our apps as needed.
    Shocking, I know.

    Sorry but I don’t understand the purpose of all this JS MVC
    frameworks. Isn’t the DOM already MVC?\
     It looks like these frameworks implement a lot of useless
    abstractions.\
     Just have a look at the JQuery+Handlebars version of the TodoMVC
    application. It contains 10 times less artifacts than any other
    versions.\
     In fact you don’t have to put all your control logic in one big js
    file. You can split it vertically by use cases in multiple files.\
     You can also separate event binding logic from the control logic
    itself.\
     I don’t read here any arguments (execpt the obvious ‘Don’t write
    spaghetti code’) in favour of these frameworks?!\
     So what can I do with these MVC frameworks that I can NOT do with
    JQuery (and plugins) that justify the use of the heavy abstractions
    provided by them?

    What we’re finding these days is that there are a growing number of
    developers creating complex web applications that are primarily
    based in the browser (i.e you have a JavaScript client communicating
    with a server-side API just for data). These applications are
    non-trivial enough (GMail is always a great example) that separating
    out their concerns almost always helps improve maintainability. In
    this light, I don’t think that architectural patterns like MVC are
    overkill, but we do have to be careful how and where we use them.

    The implications on download file size are that developers have to
    make decisions about when their users will have to download the
    ‘payload’ of scripts. Some applications (like Google Docs) take a
    dynamic approach to this, only making users download the bare
    minimum set of scripts for common functionality initially, but then
    pulling in other scripts (for things like the formula editor) when
    you select that option from the menu. Other applications just ask
    users to download most of the scripts when you first fire them up
    and you do have to keep performance and speed in mind.

    No one wants to be downloading 2MB of JavaScript unnecessarily.

    I feel you. There’s a challenge of choice, I agree, but thinking
    more about the architecture needed for JavaScript-heavy apps. is a
    necessary part of the evolution of how we write web applications
    these days – perhaps this is easier for teams where there are
    specific developers working on the frontend and backend?.

    Users prefer speed and snappiness over complete page reloads and
    bringing more of the UI logic to the browser means these speed
    improvements are more easily possible – these frameworks just help
    ensure the architecture of these UIs remains maintainable. If you
    also consider more advanced needs, like offline-support and more
    specifically, offline-sync, backend only code is only able to go so
    far with the needs of todays UIs.

    Thanks for the round up, Addy. Do you have any recommendation for a
    book or tutorial that explains how to go from jQuery to Backbone
    using what you feel are Backbone’s best practices? When I look at
    the Backbone examples there are lots of different implementations
    but I want to know what costly architecture mistakes to avoid at the

    Glad you enjoyed the post!

    I think that it’s important to factor in the context of the
    application. There will be many apps on the web for which making a
    call on how you’re serving your Views will factor in performance
    moreso than SEO – e.g if you take GMail or GDocs, those are
    affectively authenticated personal apps with no need to worry about
    the Googlebot seeing what’s in the body tag. If you’re Twitter,
    Facebook or another type of application where your content needs to
    be indexed by search engines, absolutely go for the option that
    balances perf and SEO the most optimally. I’m including some useful
    reads that expand on this topic below.

    Thanks Addy! Great article! It gives a very good overview about the
    existing MV\* frameworks. And I really like your «What Is MVC, Or
    Rather MV\*?» intro, as it makes clear, that the purpose is mainly
    for single-page applications with the need for client-side models
    and would be overkill for most «traditional» – eg. CMS related –
    stuff. Btw: there are other frameworks – eg. TerrificJS – that are
    built especially for the latter case.

    Hi Addy, first of all, great article. You should receive an award
    for this, made my day. You had me at the explanation on what should
    I use and why.\
     I have a question, though.. we’ve seen companies like twitter
    backing down from client-side rendering because of performance
    issues (apparently, all the resources were being loaded on the
    fly..?) and constantly I read that many devs are building apps this
    way and leaving the body tag without a single piece of information,
    resulting in bad SEO.\
     What’s your hunch about that? Sorry if I wasn’t clear enough.

    I’d be curious to see 3 more attributes for selection:

    1st, whether the framework can be incrementally adopted or requires
    full adoption. For instance, I have an existing application with
    traditional page-request model. I’d like to use an MV\*-like
    approach to first create some rich widgets, taking advantage of
    component model-view data binding, recommended AJAX methods, etc.
    I’ll eventually go on to take full advantage of the power of the
    framework, including routing for sub-parts of the site. I believe
    that Backbone is fine for this (just ignore Routers at first) and
    obviously something full-stack like Meteor is ruled out, but I don’t
    yet understand whether all the excellent options you included might
    also work for me.

    2nd, whether the framework can live side-by-side with existing
    JQuery components or standalone JQuery code. In my opinion there’s
    too much good stuff happening in the wider JQuery community to
    commit to a framework that makes it difficult to adopt components
    individually. And it’s not just a matter of making sure that the
    underlying DOM isn’t dynamic/obscured, it also has to be careful
    about aggressively refreshing parts of the page, etc. There’s a
    middle ground where you can – without modifying the component’s
    source – write a little external scaffolding code to trigger
    framework sync events.

    3rd, less important but also interesting, is compatibility with
    popular server-side frameworks. Is it easy to apply a particular
    framework on top of WordPress, Drupal, Django, Rails, whatever? I
    suspect that many of these are designed specifically for Rails but
    would require some server-side adapters for usage in PHP, etc. If
    this is already done, it’s likely due to community adoption as much
    as technical effort on the framework developers.

    Thanks for a really useful article!

    Once again Addy, nicely done. More explaining and less “Build
    Twitter with \* ” articles are an excellent resource for the
    community. We need these ones every now and then. The sheer choice
    to frameworks is ridiculous, becoming a haunting ultimatum for

    I remember speaking to Justin Meyer (one of the core developers
    behind CanJS and JavaScriptMVC) sometime ago and my understanding
    was that CanJS was meant to be a leaner version of JMVC that could
    be considered an alternative to lighter MV\* frameworks such as
    Backbone.js. A newer project, Done.js would ultimately replace JMVC
    (but offer most/all of it’s capabilities) but that’s probably still
    a short while away. Jupiter/Bitovi have always tried doing well by
    their users and if you enjoy JMVC, I would ask them about Done.js
    and how soon that might be available.

    Regarding JMVC, what features need to get fixed? Any feature in JMVC
    that needs to get fixed is almost certainly not even in the other
    frameworks. The only “tricky” thing I’m aware of is packages
    implicit dependency problem. But, packages is unreleased feature.

    It’s not listed in this post, but I should also mention that we
    recently landed an Epitome (a new MooTools MVP framework) app that
    should be up on our site. For more info about the framework see:

    It’s not just the framework, it’s the tooling and IDEs and how they

    Not at all. You mentioned TerrificJS – one of our goals for the next
    version of TodoMVC will be tackling frameworks that go a little
    futher. There are quite a few now tackling real-time development or
    full end to end stacks (SocketStream, Meteor etc) and more looking
    at complex modular architectures (TerrificJS, Chaplin, Aura). We
    want to try helping developers compare these solutions as easily as
    possible too, so watch this space!.

    To experiment these tools will be my holiday work, and I do think I
    will definitely have fun with it, thanks for all your hard working
    on it, I will summarize it as a blog post in Chinese to spread the

    I would happily recommend the article in Tobis reply above by Kim
    Joar Bekkelund. I was reviewing it yesterday and it appears to be a
    good fit for developers wishing to build on their jQuery foundations
    and really get stuck into Backbone. Once you’ve had a chance to read
    it, you might also be interested in Backbone Fundamentals

    Hi,

    Something I’ve posted on forums to not much response, but this seems
    like a good place for it :)

    NB: I’m coming from an MVC.Net perspective, so when I say MVC here
    please bear that in mind.

    Here’s my dilemma. I want all the goodness of controllers, I want
    strongly typed views and model binding – basically all the best bits
    of MVC.Net. However, even a fairly simple page will require some
    client side script for showing\\hiding elements, confirmation boxes
    & all that funky stuff that users expect for todays interactive web
    pages. You normally end up with ‘page specific script’ which will be
    a number of event handlers and bindings, with no real structure as
    such.

    The way Backbone, Knockout etc are designed almost relegates MVC.Net
    to a simple ‘web API’ to handle RESTful requests and respond with
    some JSON. You seem to end up moving logic that \*I believe\* should
    be in the ‘server side controller’ into a ‘script controller’, which
    I’m not really happy with (because I’m primarily a .Net developer!).
    Like you have mentioned, this is fine in something like GMail, where
    the majority of the application is on the client.

    I want: a structured script representation of my Model, that allows
    me to wire up all my client event handlers for my View and keeps
    everything in a logical order. But I still want model binding, data
    annotations, validation and logic in my .Net controller, everything
    I want handled by MVC.Net. I want the best of both in other words :)

    How I want this to work – MVC should render the view and use
    strongly typed model binding. A script that represents the view in
    some way (that I don’t have to write manually to replicate my server
    model) should automagically take over on the client to handle any
    dynamic events, allow me to manipulate the state on the client and
    then submit the form back to the controller using a standard POST.

    Most of the applications I’m working on at the moment are Line Of
    Business, but they can still have some fairly complex client side
    functionality. I’m not using any framework at the moment, I’m just
    namespacing my script and wrapping up some jQuery (i.e. Javascript
    modular pattern) … it works, just not sure if it’s the best way to
    be doing things. I’m interested how others developing in MVC are
    addressing this?

    Any thoughts appreciated
