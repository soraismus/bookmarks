Ever watch someone else type at a shell, spelling out every filename,
even making typos and fixing them, very slowly? "Hit tab!", you yell,
helpfully.

I do that when watching someone use vim.

The Quick Rundown
-----------------

  key       description
  --------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  \^P       basic tab completion, pulling from a variety of sources
  \^N       the same as \^P but backward
  \^X \^L   whole line completion
  \^X \^O   syntax-aware omnicompletion

Play with these to get a feel for them. I use this mapping:

    imap <Tab> <C-P>

The Keyboard Details
--------------------

When using completion, a helpful menu pops up, showing all the potential
matches. Within this menu you can press \^P or \^N to insert the next or
prior word, respectively, or you can press one of those hard-to-reach
arrow keys. The arrow key will select the word from the menu but will
not replace your text with the selected word; at this point you can
press \^L to enter the next character from the selected word.

When you're happy with the selected word you can press \^Y; to give up
entirely, press \^E. When you're happy with the selected word but ready
to keep typing other stuff, just keep typing. It'll figure it out.

You can also insert the tokens after a completion, which is useful for
when you forget that we invented abstractions 40 years ago. For example,
let's say you have this Gherkin:

    Scenario: paint a wall blue
      Given I have some paint
      And I have a white wall
      When I paint the wall blue
      Then I should see "success"

And now you want to make a similar scenario, but for red:

    Scenario: paint a wall red
      G^X^L^X^L^X^L^Wred
      T^X^L

The Configurations
------------------

You can change all of this. Here are three useful options with the
settings that make me happy:

    set complete=.,b,u,]

\^P and \^N pull from a list of words computed by vim; the source of
these completions is determined by the `complete` setting. In the above
example it will pull from keywords in the current file, other buffers
(closed or still open), and from the current tags file. More details:
[`:h 'complete'`](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'complete')

    set wildmode=longest,list:longest

How vim should go about replacing your text. The above setting is
closest to the default for zsh, which might be what you want. Other
possiblities are listed at
[`:h 'wildmode'`](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'wildmode').

    set completeopt=menu,preview

This is the default, and it works just fine. It shows a menu and, if
available, any additional tips such as the method signature or defining
file. If you really want to change it, read up on the details at
[`:h 'completeopt'`](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'completeopt').

Be Smarter
----------

While the above configurations are useful for simple pleasures, we can
make the configuration more intelligent by writing functions in
vimscript. For example, in HTML vim should know that you can't nest a
`div` inside an `a` or that `class` is a valid attribute name but
`classic` is not. Enter `omnifunc`.

There are five relevant `omnifunc`s that ship with vim: CSS, HTML,
JavaScript, Ruby, and SQL. They are autoloaded for the relevant
filetype, slower than \^P, and totally brilliant. They can fill in
defined method names after `.` in Ruby, complete property names in CSS,
automatically close the correct tag in HTML, or guess at table and
column names in SQL.

Many other `omnifunc` definitions exist for other languages, and you can
write your own. For more details see
[`:h complete-functions`](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/insert.html#complete-functions).

But Wait, There's More!
-----------------------

This blog post is a tiny fraction of what's available. Dictionaries,
thesauri, tags, filenames, vim command names, and so much more are all
documented under
[`:h ins-completion`](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/insert.html#ins-completion).

So next time, hit tab!
