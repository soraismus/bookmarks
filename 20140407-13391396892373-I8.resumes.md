What does it take to make a **top-notch software engineer resume**? It's
easy to ignore the issue, but resumes [still matter for
engineers](/why-you-still-need-a-programming-resume). Think about these
tips and your resume won't let you down...even when you're interviewing
with the best tech companies on Earth.

Answer this: why was your project necessary?
--------------------------------------------

Companies aren't just looking for people who can code. They need codes
who can **make a difference.** Sure, you might have implemented a new
feature "in less than a month", but was the task an important one?

Were users calling support constantly? Were visitors bouncing off your
product page because you didn't have a crucial feature? Set up the
**context for your projects.** Your goal is to show that your previous
companies trusted you enough to give you extremely important tasks.

Don't string together more than two verbs when describing how you contributed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any software project will involve "design", "implementation", "testing",
"deployment", and "support". If you did all of that stuff yourself, you
can save that space and just say that you "made" it. Use all that saved
real estate to give more **context** around the project. Compare:**\
**

*Designed, implemented, tested, deployed, and supported a web analytics
interface.*

*versus:*

*Made a web interface for analyzing pageviews, URL referrals, and
geolocations.*

Answer this: where can I look at some stuff you built?
------------------------------------------------------

Putting a link on your resume just beams with confidence. It says:
**"****don't take my word for it - see for yourself."** If you don't
share Open Source code online, you might be able to show what you built
with **screenshots or architecture diagrams** instead. Put together a
simple portfolio site at a memorable domain and you'll still have a
great impact.

Don't go into equal detail with each position.
----------------------------------------------

It might be tempting to put an equal number of bullet points beneath
each position you've held in the past. But **some chapters of your
career will make better stories than others.**

Answer this: what was the impact of your work...in numbers?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Just "getting things done" isn't enough. Show your next company how
**you made an impact** in:

-   pageviews
-   engagement
-   uptime
-   saved costs
-   bug reports

That will make the different between "I could have written that" and "I
want *those* results."\

Don't try to grab attention with gimmicks.
------------------------------------------

**Do** make sure your resume is beautifully laid out with a
professional-looking, readable font. But **don't** try any gimmicks like
putting memes on your resume, laying it out in landscape orientation, or
making it a giant QR code. Doing these things will definitely get you
attention, but not the kind you're looking for.

**Edit**: Hackernews user imdsm
[disagrees](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7515289) with this
point:

> *"I got my current job because my resume stood out. It was the only
> one not written in MS word...if you're going for a development role
> where you may be full stack, or expected to be different, make sure
> your resume shows that."*

Answer this: what kind of job are you looking for?
--------------------------------------------------

This is **especially important for students**. You don't want to be
interviewing for internships if you're looking for a full time position.

Including an Objective is important for those of us who have been out of
school for a while, too. Companies need to **tailor the interview
process differently** for a junior developer position versus a tech lead
role. Tell companies what you want, and you're more likely to get it.

Don't let your hobbies take up space.
-------------------------------------

Companies are way more likely to hire you if they think you're an
interesting person. But **they expect to find that information on the
Web** - like on a Twitter bio. They're more likely to do that if you
focus on using your resume to show why you're the best developer on the
entire planet.

Answer this: which languages and databases do you prefer?
---------------------------------------------------------

Don't make hiring managers read your whole resume just to figure out
**if you're even willing to write Java** or not. You should include a
short list of technologies that you specialize in. Writing a great list
can make a huge difference in a software engineer resume.

Not sure if your list of technologies is up-to-stuff? Use my free

immediate feedback. You'll know if you're mentioning the right languages
and databases in your resume in seconds.

Welcome to Does Not Compute
---------------------------

I'm a Software Engineer at [HubSpot](http://hubspot.com/), local
celebrity, and [rampant capitalist](http://bizbizbiz.biz). Engineering
is hard, so here's a soapbox for me to complain about how hard it is.
