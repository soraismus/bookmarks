Privacy Protects Bothersome People
==================================

…and isn't about me (or probably you)

One of the consequences of the Edward Snowden story is a heightened
discussion about the importance of privacy - in particular when or if
privacy should be traded off in order to combat terrorism. To think
about this we need to understand why privacy of individuals is important
to a democracy. We often hear statements like *"I have nothing to
hide"*, or as a friend of mine put it *"the NSA doesn't care about
insignificant people like you or me"*. I may care about my privacy, but
should my personal desire trump the needs of our broader society?

For many people, privacy is a fundamental right - they see no reason why
a government should be meddling in my affairs without a more specific
reason than a blanket search for possible terrorism. But even if you
don't share a desire to preserve some privacy from government agents,
you should still be concerned about citizens' privacy. This is because
it isn't about me, or my friend. The value of privacy to us isn't
primarily about *our* privacy but about those who play a more active
role in the operation of a democratic system of government. Such
activity often involves bothering people who have power, and those with
power are likely to use their power to suppress the bothersome. But
without all that bothering, democracy withers.

A couple of concrete examples should make this easier to see. The first
is that of journalists. Journalism is itself a profession that's
noticeably suspect to [Sturgeon's
law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_Law). But the frivolousness
and disrepute that tarnishes much journalism doesn't invalidate good
journalism when it happens. Good journalism is about helping us
understand what is happening in the world, such journalism often
requires asking hard questions of those in power, and digging behind the
surface to find truths that the powerful would rather remain hidden.
Such digging is considerable bother to those in power, particularly when
it exposes corruption or incompetence.

A second example is activists who are looking to change our society.
Such activists, by their nature, are often trying to change accepted
habits of behavior. They may be clamoring for gay rights, or against
abortions, or against factory farming. Their protests and campaigns will
often be against the interests of those in power, and thus their
activities are considerable bother - especially as they gain traction.

So let's suppose you're in power, you're being bothered by journalists
and activists, and you have access to metadata about everyone's
telephone calls. With this information you can find out who your
tormentors are talking to, where their sources of information are, who
is supporting them with encouragement and funds. You can act against
these people to block their support. You may also find things out about
your tormentors and supporters that can be used to discredit them. An
activist in favor of gay rights is likely to know many gay people, often
in places where homosexuality is considered abhorrent. That's a
vulnerability that you can exploit. Furthermore your tormentors are
unlikely to be saints, most people have things that can look bad,
particularly when you can apply a powerful spin. A journalist's
substance abuse problem may not be stopping her expose corruption, but
you can use it to derail her efforts.

I'm not saying that privacy is an absolute. Foiling criminal activity
often means breaching privacy - a database of phone calls can be helpful
tool to investigate a criminal network. But we must also be aware that
[such tools are always liable to
misuse](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/08/heres-what-can-go-wrong-when-the-government-builds-a-huge-database-about-americans/),
and thus we must ensure we discuss how to design controls to reduce such
misuse to a minimum.

I'm not a crusading journalist nor an activist, so why should all this
trouble me? Without good journalists I can't understand what is really
happening and thus I can't cast a meaningful vote. Flourishing
corruption suffocates economic activity and progress. Activists who seem
fringe now, may lead us to changes that are self-evident in a few
generations (there was considerable harassment of those that fought
against slavery or in favor of female suffrage). In short if we can't
protect the privacy of those who bother the powerful, then we lose a
vital pillar of a democratic society.

Later Incidents
---------------

Some examples of the kind of abuses I'm concerned about that have
appeared since I wrote this

-   The [Washington Post reports on an internal NSA
    audit](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-broke-privacy-rules-thousands-of-times-per-year-audit-finds/2013/08/15/3310e554-05ca-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html)
    saying that the NSA has 2,776 "incidents" in one year where they
    violated rules or court orders on surveillance.
-   Glen Greenwald's partner [was held at Heathrow
    Airport](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/18/glenn-greenwald-guardian-partner-detained-heathrow),
    and his electronic equipment confiscated, under legislation intended
    to be used for investigating terrorism.

Further Reading
---------------

One investigative journalist who has been subject to a lot of harassment
is Laura Poitras, a 2012 MacArthur Fellow and award-winning documentary
filmmaker. Her experiences have been documented by
[Salon](http://www.salon.com/2012/04/08/u_s_filmmaker_repeatedly_detained_at_border/singleton/)
and the [New York Times
Magazine](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html).

PJ, the host of the excellent Groklaw site that's been helping to
explain the law and act to defend the open sources community, [explains
why lack of privacy has made her
quit](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20130818120421175). It
expands my argument into the role privacy plays in psychological
well-being.
