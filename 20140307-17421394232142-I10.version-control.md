Software Branching and Parallel Universes
=========================================

Source control is [the very bedrock of software
development](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000660.html).
Without some sort of version control system in place, you can't
reasonably call yourself a software engineer. If you're using a source
control system of any kind, you're versioning files almost by
definition. The concept of versioning is deeply embedded in every source
control system. You can't avoid it.

But there's another concept, equally fundamental to source control,
which is much less frequently used in practice. That concept is
**branching**. The Subversion documentation has a decent [layman's
description of branching](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch04.html):

> Suppose it's your job to maintain a handbook for a particular division
> of your company. One day a different division asks you for the same
> handbook-- but with a few parts modified specifically for them, as
> they do things slightly differently.
>
> What do you do in this situation? You do the obvious thing: you make a
> second copy of your document, and begin maintaining the two copies
> separately. As each department asks you to make small changes, you
> incorporate them into one copy or the other. But you often find
> yourself wanting to make the same change to both copies. For example,
> if you discover a typo in the first copy, it's very likely that the
> same typo exists in the second copy. The two documents are almost the
> same, after all; they only differ in small, specific ways.
>
> This is the basic concept of a branch-- a line of development that
> exists independently of another line, yet still shares a common
> history. A branch always begins life as a copy of something, and moves
> on from there, generating its own history.

If you don't ever use the branching feature of your source control
system, *are you really taking full advantage of your source control
system?*

I find that **almost every client I visit is barely using branching at
all**. Branching is widely misunderstood, and rarely implemented-- even
though branching, like versioning, lies at the very heart of source
control, and thus software engineering.

Perhaps the most accessible way to think of branches is as **parallel
universes**. They're places where, for whatever reason, history didn't
go quite the same way as it did in your universe. From that point
forward, that universe can be slightly different-- or it can be
radically and utterly transformed. Like the Marvel comic book series
[What If?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If_(comics)), branching
lets you answer some interesting and possibly even dangerous "what if"
questions with your software development.

[![What If \#43: What if Conan The Barbarian was stranded in the 20th
century?](/content/images/uploads/2007/10/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86da733970b-pi.jpg)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If_(comics))

Parallel universes offer infinite possibility. They also allow you to
stay safely ensconced in the particular universe of your choice,
completely isolated from any events in other alternate universes. An
alternate universe where the Nazis won World War II is an interesting
idea, so long as we don't have to *live* in that universe. There could
potentially be thousands of these parallel universes. Although branching
offers the seductive appeal of infinite possibility with very little
risk, it also brings along something far less desirable: **infinite
complexity**.

The DC comic book series [Crisis on Infinite
Earths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths) is a
cautionary tale of the problems you can encounter if you start spinning
off too many parallel universes.

> Prior to Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC was notorious for its

> originally couldn't fly (he could instead leap over an eighth of a
> mile), and his powers came from having evolved on a planet with

Start juggling too many parallel universes at once, and you're bound to
drop a few. In most source control systems, you can create hundreds of
branches with no performance issues whatsoever; it's the **mental
overhead** of keeping track of all those branches that you really need
to worry about. Your developer's brains can't exactly be upgraded the
same way your source control server can, so this is a serious problem.

I find that the analogy of parallel universes helps developers grasp the
concept of branching, along with its inevitable pros and cons. But it
doesn't get much easier from there. Branching is a complex beast. There
are dozens of ways to branch, and nobody can really tell you if you're
doing it right or wrong. Here are a [few common branching
patterns](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730834(VS.80).aspx)
you might recognize.

**Branch per Release**\
 Every release is a new branch; common changes are merged between the
releases. Branches are killed off only when the releases are no longer
supported.

Release](/content/images/uploads/2007/10/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86da780970b-pi.png)

**Branch per Promotion**\
 Every tier is a permanent branch. As changes are completed and tested,
they pass the quality gate and are "promoted" as merges into successive
tiers.

![Branch Per
Promotion](/content/images/uploads/2007/10/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86da788970b-pi.png)

**Branch per Task**\
 Every development task is a new, independent branch. Tasks are merged
into the permanent main branch as they are completed.

![Branch Per
Task](/content/images/uploads/2007/10/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86da78d970b-pi.png)

**Branch per Component**\
 Each architectural component of the system is a new, independent
branch. Components are merged into the main branch as they are
completed.

Component](/content/images/uploads/2007/10/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86da7a0970b-pi.png)

**Branch per Technology**\
 Each technology platform is a permanent branch. Common parts of the
codebase are merged between each platform.

Technology](/content/images/uploads/2007/10/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86da7b3970b-pi.png)

You may notice a few emerging themes in these branch patterns:

-   All branches have a clearly defined lifecycle. They either live
    forever, or they are eventually killed off.
-   All branches are created with the intention of eventually merging,
    somewhere. A branch without a merge is pointless.
-   As we add branches, our development model gets complicated.

But that complication is often justified. The more developers you have
on a project, the higher the chances are that one of those developers
will check something really bad into source control and disrupt everyone
else's work. It's simple statistics. People make mistakes. The more
developers you have, the more mistakes you'll have. And the more
developers you have, the greater the consequences when everyone's work
is simultaneously disrupted by a bad checkin. So what are our options?

1.  **Maximum Productivity**\
     Everyone works in the same common area. There are no branches, just
    a long, unbroken straight line of development. There's nothing to
    understand, so checkins are brainlessly simple-- but each checkin
    can break the entire project and bring all progress to a screeching
    halt.
2.  **Minimum Risk**\
     Every single person on the project works in their own private
    branch. This minimizes risk; everyone works independently, and
    nobody can disrupt anyone else's work. But it also adds incredible
    process overhead. Collaboration becomes almost comically difficult--
    every person's work has to be painstakingly merged with everyone
    else's work to see even the smallest part of the complete system.

The answer usually lies somewhere between these two extremes. Like
everything else, branching can be abused. Chris Birmele notes that
**branching has its own set of anti-patterns** you should [watch out
for](http://blogs.msdn.com/chrisbirmele/archive/2006/05/31/611179.aspx):

**Merge Paranoia**

Merging is avoided at all cost, due to a fear of the consequences.

**Merge Mania**

The team spends an inordinate amount of time merging software assets
rather than developing them.

**Big Bang Merge**

Merging has been deferred to the very end of the development effort and
an attempt is made to merge all branches simultaneously.

**Never Ending Merge**

Merge activity never seems to end; there's always more to merge.

**Wrong Way Merge**

A software asset is merged with a *previous* version.

**Branch Mania**

Branches are created often and for no apparent reason.

**Cascading Branches**

Branches are never merged back to the main development line.

**Mysterious Branches**

Nobody can tell you what the branches are for.

**Temporary Branches**

The purpose of a branch keeps changing; it effectively serves as a
permanent "temporary" workspace.

**Volatile Branches**

An unstable branch is shared by other branches or merged into another
branch.

**Development Freeze**

All development activities are stopped during branching, merging and
building new baselines

**Berlin Wall**

Branches are used to divide the development team members, rather than
divide the work they are performing.

If you've managed to read this far, perhaps you can understand why so
many software development teams are completely sold on version control,
but hesitant to take on branching and merging. It's a powerful,
fundamental source control feature, sure, but it's also complicated. If
you're not careful, the wrong branching strategy could do more harm to
your project than good.

Still, I urge developers to make an effort to understand branching--
*really* understand it-- and explore using branching strategies where
appropriate on their projects. Done right, the mental cost of the
branching tax pales in comparison to [the benefits of concurrent
development](http://www.ericsink.com/scm/scm_branches.html) it enables.
**Embrace the idea of parallel universes in your code**, and you may
find that you can get more done, with less risk. Just try to avoid a
crisis on infinite codebases while you're at it.
