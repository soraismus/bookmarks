[Calling Lisp from C using ECL](http://cwndr.ws/posts/Calling-Lisp-from-C-using-ECL.html)
=========================================================================================

Lisp is amazing. Of course you already knew that. The only problem with
it, is that we live in a C world. Because of this, I set out to run some
Lisp in a portable C program.

First you will need to have [ECL](http://ecls.sourceforge.net/)
installed. You can find the instructions for doing this
[here](http://ecls.sourceforge.net/new-manual/pr01s06.html).

We will write a very simple lisp program:

    (in-package :cl-user)

    (defun add (x y)
      (+ x y))

Yes, I know this is stupid, but we're just trying to get everything
talking.

Next we will create a build file using ecl's
[`compile-file`](http://ecls.sourceforge.net/ecl/The-compiler.html)
function to build an object file:

    (compile-file "add.lisp" :system-p t)

This will generate an `add.o` object file. We can then build a static
library with the following:

    (c:build-static-library "add" 
                :lisp-files '("add.o")
                :init-name "init_add")
    (quit)

This will give us a static library named `libadd.a` that we can use in
our C program.

Next, we will write a small C program that uses our adding lisp library.

    #include <ecl/ecl.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    extern void init_add(cl_object cblock);

    // Make sure this doesn't get called before 'cl_boot'
    int lisp_add(int x, int y)
    {
      cl_object sum = cl_funcall(3, c_string_to_object("add"), ecl_make_int(x), ecl_make_int(y));
      return ecl_to_int(sum);
    }

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
      if (argc<2) {
        printf("I need 2 arguments to add\n");
        return 1;
      }
      int x = atoi(argv[1]);
      int y = atoi(argv[2]);
      cl_boot(argc, argv);
      read_VV(OBJNULL, init_add);
      int sum = lisp_add(x, y);
      printf("%d\n", sum);
      cl_shutdown();
      return 0;
    }

And finally a Makefile:

    CC=cc
    C_SOURCE=lispadd.c
    LISP_BUILD=build.lisp
    INCLUDE=/usr/local/include
    LIBRARIES=-L/usr/local/lib -L.
    OUTPUT=lispadd
    CFLAGS=-I$(INCLUDE) $(LIBRARIES) -ladd -lecl

    all: lispadd

    libadd.a:
        ecl -load $(LISP_BUILD)

    lispadd: libadd.a
        $(CC) $(C_SOURCE) $(CFLAGS) -o $(OUTPUT)

    clean:
        rm -f libadd.a
        rm -f add.o
        rm -f lispadd
        rm -f add.fas

You might need to change some values at the top of the makefile to
reflect your setup.

Now run `make` to build the binary.

Try it out! ` ./lispadd 7 8 => 15`

[Github](https://github.com/cwandrews/lisp-c-example)

[Simple Connection Pooling with Go Channels](http://cwndr.ws/posts/Simple-Connection-Pooling-with-Go-Channels.html)
===================================================================================================================

posted on 2014-08-31

Go is great for what it offers you out of the box. One of the best thing
go gives is a great set of concurrency primitives. Here I present a
super easy way to build a connection pool in go using buffered channels.
It's a basic semaphore. The implementation below is specifically for
clients using the ["net/rpc"](http://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/) package.

First, we will create a connPool struct to hold our channel, and some
other info:

    type connPool struct {
        cliChan chan *rpc.Client
        address string
    }

the connPool holds the address in case it has to reconnect one of the
clients in the channel after initialization.

To initialize a new client, we will create a tcp connection and
instantiate a new `rpc.Client` and return it:

    func newCli(addr string) *rpc.Client {
        if conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", addr); err != nil {
            return newCli(addr)
        } else {
            return rpc.NewClient(conn)
        }
    }

notice that we go into an endless recursive loop if the client never
connects. This is obviously not a good idea if you want the client to
function without a connection to the server, but for the application I
originally wrote this for, I wanted the client to block until it
connects.

Next, we will initialize the connPool with a bunch of client
connections:

    func newConnPool(addr string, sz int) (*connPool, error) {
        cliChan := make(chan *rpc.Client, sz)
        for i := 0; i < sz; i++ {
            cli := newCli(addr)
            cliChan <- cli
        }
        pool := &connPool{
            cliChan: cliChan,
            address: addr,
        }
        return pool, nil
    }

This function creates however many `rpc.Client`'s as we tell it in `sz`
and stores them in a buffered channel.

The real beauty of the buffered channel connection pool comes in the
function that actually uses the client:

    func (c *connPool) Call(method string, args, reply interface{}) error {
        cli := <-c.cliChan
        err := cli.Call(method, args, reply)
        if err != nil && err.Error() == "connection is shut down" {
            cli = newCli(c.address)
            err = cli.Call(method, args, reply)
        }
        c.cliChan <- cli
        return err
    }

This function grabs a `rpc.Client` out of the channel and calls to the
server using it. If the connection is down (meaning that the server hung
up probably) we will create a new client with a good connection or block
until the server comes back up. we then put the good connection that was
used or the new one that was just created back in the channel for the
next caller.

The awesome thing we get for free from go's channels is that channels
are thread safe so I can have many go routines making calls using this
pool, at least as many as was defined by `sz` in `newConnPool`. If a go
routine with a reference to the connPool tries to call and all the
clients are being used, it blocks, which for the application I wrote
this for, is exactly the behavior I wanted.
