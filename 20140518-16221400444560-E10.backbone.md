1 - Article Overview
--------------------

Not a lot of in-depth information from a single voice has been written
about Backbone itself. We have varying degrees of information about how
Backbone can be implemented to create an application. We have lots of
opinions about how it does or does not fit into the Model/View/Whatever
world. We have more than enough "to-do" demo applications, which can
bring a layer of value when learning about application design. However,
what I think is lacking are details about Backbone itself and what the
actual code is doing. The [documentation](http://backbonejs.org/) offers
some degree of this as well as the [annotated
source](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html), but I think [more
information](http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/12/27/the-responsibilities-of-the-various-pieces-of-backbone-js/)
is needed. Or, at the very least, a different voice documenting
Backbone's function and parts.

In Part 1 and Part 2 of Backbone.js Deconstructed, we are going to
examine the function of the Backbone Library at the code level.

Specifically, in Part 1 we will identify some helpful (dare I say
'required'?) prerequisites that make learning Backbone a rewarding
endeavor. Then we will cover some critical details about Single Page
Applications (SPAs) that are needed before one can truly understand the
purpose and parts of Backbone. After we have a mental foundation for
SPAs, we will dive into the code by systematically breaking down the
details around [Backbone.Events](http://backbonejs.org/#Events),
creating Backbone Objects, the
[Backbone.Router()](http://backbonejs.org/#Router) and
[Backbone.History()](http://backbonejs.org/#History), and lastly,
[Backbone utilities](http://backbonejs.org/#Utility). In Part 2 of
Backbone.js Deconstructed, we will systematically uncover the purpose
and functionality provided by
[Backbone.Model](http://backbonejs.org/#Model),
[Backbone.View](http://backbonejs.org/#View), and
[Backbone.Collection](http://backbonejs.org/#Collection).

Now, for the part where I you tell you what you won't find in these two
articles. You won't find in-depth information about MVC, MVVM, MVP, or
MV-Whatever patterns. I purposefully have sidestepped any in-depth
discussion about these patterns because I believe that Backbone is such
a simple library that if you learn the function of the code, the
implementation part will be obvious and you will remain free to adapt
Backbone to your own domain.

You also won’t find an application being built in this article. This is
commonly the method of teaching Backbone to newcomers and [plenty of
approaches in this fashion are
available](http://pluralsight.com/training/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=backbone-fundamentals).
Additionally, I am not writing this article to produce yet another
tutorial that briefly talks about Models and Views.

In this article, we are breaking down the major parts of Backbone and
examining the function of each part at the code level. Expect to get
intimate with each part of Backbone.

2 - Backbone Prerequisites
--------------------------

**2.1 - You Need Intermediate Knowledge of JavaScript and the DOM**

Backbone abstracts a great deal of the repetitive tasks that can be
accomplished with native DOM and HTML5 JavaScript APIs. Because of this,
if you are not experienced with the DOM or with JavaScript, learning
about a solution like Backbone might prove to be rather difficult, slow,
and frustrating. Consider that Backbone itself reaches out for a third
party solution (i.e. jQuery, Ender, or Zepto) for DOM manipulation and
that is two layers of abstraction to get lost in if you do not already
have a firm grip on native DOM scripting and modern JavaScript APIs
(e.g. XHR). If you are not at least an intermediate JavaScript
developer, you will mostly likely struggle with learning Backbone, as
well as my words on the matter.

**2.2 - You Need Experience with HTTP, XHR, and RESTful JSON APIs**

Backbone comes with some helpers that make saving/syncing data to the
backend trivial. Of course, a JSON API is assumed, so if you are not
familiar with
[HTTP](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1/),
[XHR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started), or
reading and writing data to the server by using a
[RESTful](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/whatisrest.html)
[JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JSON) API, you might not
clearly understand what Backbone is doing for you, or its value in doing
it so that you don't have to.

**2.3 - Experience with a Functional Programming Library**

When Backbone was authored, a supporting library was created along with
it, called [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/), which provides the
functional programming utilities used by Backbone. This library is a
separate tool, which can be used without Backbone, but Backbone has a
hard dependency on Underscore.js. Having experience with a functional
programming utility library like Underscore.js or
[Lo-Dash.js](http://lodash.com/) will help you not only understand the
Backbone code better, it will also help you understand the functional
methods that are inherited and usable on the Backbone
[Model](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-Underscore-Methods) and
[Collection](http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-Underscore-Methods)
objects. If you have not spent any time gleaning the programming
goodness found in Underscore.js or Lo-Dash.js, I highly suggest you
spent some time in the trenches of one of these libraries.

**Notes:**

-   The functional programming utility library
    [Lo-Dash.js](http://lodash.com/) is a [drop-in replacement for
    Underscore.js](https://raw.github.com/bestiejs/lodash/v1.3.1/dist/lodash.underscore.js).
-   At the very least, before you proceed learning Backbone, you should
    have a solid understanding of exactly what the utility method
    [extend()](http://underscorejs.org/#extend) is doing. It is the most
    used utility method in the Backbone source code. If you prefer
    Lo-Dash.js, keep in mind that the Lo-Dash.js library calls this
    [assign()](http://lodash.com/docs#assign) and `extend()` is an alias
    for `assign()`.

**2.4 - You Need a Loose Understanding of Models and Views**

Backbone strives to alleviate the “tangled piles of jQuery selectors and
callbacks, all trying frantically to keep data in sync between the HTML
UI”, and in the right hands, it does just that. However, it is just as
easy to create a tangled pile of Backbone Events, Models, Collections,
and Views. One can always just jump in and thrash about until they
figure out how to swim in the Backbone pool, but a general understanding
of a model and view will aid a developer when it comes to learning and
implementing Backbone. Unfortunately, gaining even a loose conceptual
understanding of application architecture patterns and sub-design
patterns is challenging. I would recommend, at the very least, a general
understanding of a model and view without getting tied up in a flavor of
architecture for grounding the concept of a model or view. If you are
starting with zero knowledge about a model or a view, I am going to
offer a short Backbone-biased definition for each. If you feel strongly
that you already have a conceptual understanding of a model and view,
skip this section so I don't taint your previous knowledge.

**Model** - A model contains the state (i.e. the JSON data or what
Backbone calls attributes) for an application, as well as a basic set of
functionality (i.e. methods like
[.set()](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-set) or
[.get()](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-get) and events like
[change](http://backbonejs.org/#Events-catalog)) for managing and
listening to changes in the state/data. Additionally, the model
orchestrates the storing of this state/data in memory in the browser, as
well as persisting the state/data to the database on the server (i.e.
syncing). An ordered grouping of models is a collection. In Backbone,
collections are wrapped with a basic set of functionality for working
with groups of models. The classic illustration of a model would be the
data for a to-do item (i.e. the to-do and its state of completion), and
a list of to-dos would be considered a collection of to-do models. If
you think in terms of a table, the table would be the collection (i.e.
to-dos), the headers in the table would be the model (i.e. title,
status), and the content in the table rows would be the data (i.e. get a
dog, done).

todo's (i.e. collection of to-do models)

title (i.e. model attribute)

status (i.e. model attribute)

get a dog (i.e. model attribute value)

done (i.e. model attribute value)

**View** - A view contains the logic to render an interactive UI of the
state/data contained in models and collections of models. Views allow
for state/data to be decoupled from the DOM so that multiple views can
make use of the same models and collections. Thus, if you change a model
or a model contained in a collection, multiple views can listen for
these changes and update accordingly. So, ["the
truth"](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Getting-Truth-Out-of-the-DOM),
or the state/data is not tied to the view; rather, it is decoupled from
the view, or specifically, from the DOM/HTML.

3 - Application Architecture, Model View Whatever, and Backbone
---------------------------------------------------------------

**3.1 - Architectural Assumptions Made by Backbone**

Backbone was written for use in the context of developing a SPA (AKA
Single Page Application). You might wonder what that is, exactly. In
short, a SPA is a web architecture which loads a single web page
(typically one index.html or app.html) through which the entire
application can be delivered to the client by using custom events,
custom url handling, and asynchronous HTTP retrieval and storing of
resources, all while avoiding traditional browser page reloads.
Basically, a SPA architecture loads one HTML page so that JavaScript can
then be used to mimic/override/orchestrate the default nature of the
browser that is used in traditional web application architectures. Let's
examine the architectural assumptions of a Backbone SPA in more detail:

-   Backbone SPAs assume application logic (collections, models, views)
    will reside in the client (i.e. browser memory) instead of the
    server. Because of this, Backbone applications are typically written
    entirely in JavaScript. Nowadays, even some of the backend parts
    might be written in JavaScript (e.g. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
    provides RESTful API).
-   Backbone SPAs assume you want to organize the application in a loose
    Model-View-Whatever pattern.
-   Backbone SPAs assume that after the initial synchronous loading of
    the single web page, any additional changes within the application
    will be handled asynchronously and based on custom events and custom
    URLs (i.e. routing URLs defined not by file system hierarchy, but by
    application architecture, logic, and data API).
-   Backbone SPAs typically manage the changes in the URLs and browser
    history with their own routing and history mechanism, therein
    bypassing the traditional loading and caching of web pages.
-   Backbone SPAs assume data manipulation and persistence (i.e. CRUD or
    "create", "read", "update", or "delete") using a RESTful JSON API.

Single page applications which leverage RESTful JSON APIs are the sweet
spot for Backbone. If you are building something else, or the data API
is not set up for REST, you might still find value in the event, model,
view, and collection logic provided by Backbone, but you should be aware
that you are out of the Backbone sweet spot, given that many Backbone
features assume a RESTful JSON API.

**3.2 - Backbone Doesn’t (and You Shouldn’t) Focus on the Whatever part
of Model-View-Whatever (i.e. MV\*)**

The study of MV-Whatever patterns is not without merit. However, the
study of Backbone in the context of the MV-Whatever family might do more
harm than good. Backbone is an incredibly small library, and the
approach one could take to grok a Model-View-Whatever architecture can
be accomplished by setting aside this topic altogether and simply
studying what Backbone is doing at the code level. Instead of trying to
wrap your head around the very opinionated concepts surrounding the
'Whatever' part of MV-Whatever (i.e. MV\*), I recommend instead that you
ground your understanding of Backbone in its function and the simple
notion that its purpose is to provide aid when organizing application
data (models) and UI (views) for SPAs. I believe that if you learn
exactly what the JavaScript is doing, you will naturally start to grok
the world of Backbone MV-Whatever.

**3.3 - Backbone is a Library, Not a Framework**

Backbone is a JavaScript library which provides an event system and a
set of constructor functions for creating objects that can be used in a
MV-Whatever manner to organize and sync data for a single page web
application. The strongest framework-like-opinions built into Backbone
are found in its assumption that a SPA architecture and RESTful JSON API
are in use. Remember, a framework calls your code, while a library is
code that you call. Backbone, in a nut shell, is a library of
constructor functions that you leverage as a developer in order to add
structure to your application. It is not a framework!

**3.4 - Backbone Doesn't Provide Everything Needed to Develop a Single
Page, Thick Client, Web Application**

As previously mentioned, Backbone is not a framework. It is only a piece
of the application puzzle. When building out a single page web
application, you will likely require many of the developer tools listed
below (the list does not include solutions for building a RESTful JSON
API service):

-   A build tool / taskrunner (e.g. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/))
-   A package manager (e.g. [Bower](http://bower.io/))
-   A dependency manager (e.g. [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/))
-   A UI widget library (e.g. [KendoUI](http://www.kendoui.com/))
-   A testing framework/runner (e.g.
    [Mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha))
-   A templating solution (e.g. [Handlerbars](http://handlebarsjs.com/))
-   A scaffolding solution (e.g. [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/))
-   A development server (e.g. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/))

If the list above looks like a foreign language to you, then the last
thing I would recommend is learning Backbone via a third party Backbone
framework that leverages these tools.

Before you use a Backbone framework, research each of the above tools.
Use them and make sure you understand the problem they are solving. When
this is done, check out some of the non-framework [community
extensions](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/wiki/Extensions,-Plugins,-Resources).
Doing this will help you familiarize yourself with some of the gaps
other developers have found when using Backbone.

When a proper understanding of Backbone itself has been achieved (along
with its gaps), and you understand the problem each of the previously
mentioned tools solves, you might find one of the following Backbone
toolkits/frameworks useful:

-   [Vertebrae](https://github.com/tbranyen/vertebrae)
-   [Thorax](http://thoraxjs.org/)
-   [Chaplin](http://chaplinjs.org/)
-   [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/)
-   [BBB (Backbone
    Boilerplate)](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/grunt-bbb)
-   [Backbone.Giraffe](http://barc.github.io/backbone.giraffe/)

However, inviting the additional layers of abstraction provided by these
toolkits should be done with extreme caution. These solutions provide a
great deal of boilerplate, opinions, and plenty of rope to hang
yourself. I would only reach for one of these once you have a thorough
understanding of Backbone and the underlining tools that these
frameworks may use.

4 - Backbone Big Picture Stuff
------------------------------

**4.1 - Backbone's Beginnings**

Backbone was conjured up specifically to add structure to single page
applications (to be exact, it was constructed during the creation of the
[DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/home) application) so as
to avoid the repetitive DOM glue and mixing of data within the DOM that
had historically been written to keep the UI in sync with the data.
Backbone accomplishes this by providing a set of constructor functions
which produce a model, collection, and view object, all for the purpose
of organizing application data, logic, and presentation. These objects,
once instantiated, have a very specific relationship to each other and
are intended to keep your application modular, decoupled (communicating
using an event system), and scalable.

**4.2 - Backbone Provides Application Structure, as Well as Helpers for
Building SPAs**

In addition to the `Backbone.Model()`, `Backbone.Collection()`, and
`Backbone.View()` constructor functions (i.e. the meat), Backbone
additionally provides the following helpers for building SPAs and saving
data with a RESTful JSON API:

-   Router logic (i.e. `Backbone.Router`), so that specific functions
    can be invoked when the URL changes.
-   Router history logic (i.e. `Backbone.History`), so that the correct
    route occurs when the user uses the browser back or forward button.
    Remember, this is a single page application; traditional URLs are
    not used.
-   Syncing logic (i.e. `Backbone.Sync`), which aids in the reading and
    saving of data to the server.
-   An Event (i.e. `Backbone.Event`) system that facilitates the\
     communication between models, views, and collections through the
    use of custom events and event listeners.
-   A functional JavaScript library (i.e. Underscore.js or Lo-Dash.js).

These helper parts, just mentioned, should be understood before
attempting to grok models, collections, and views. And, in fact, this is
exactly what I have set out to accomplish in Part 1 of this article.

**4.3 - Backbone Hard & Soft Dependencies**

The only hard dependency identified by the Backbone documentation is the
use of a functional programming utility library, either Underscore.js or
Lo-Dash.js. Don’t get hung up here on which to choose, just choose one
and use it, or Backbone literally won’t work. If you want to be told
which to use, use Lo-Dash.js.

In addition to either Underscore.js or Lo-Dash.js, Backbone has soft
dependencies on json2.js and your choice of
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/), or
[Ender](http://ender.jit.su/) (really anything that mimics the jQuery
API will work). If the soft dependency on a DOM library is not included
or `window.JSON` is not provided by the browser the `Backbone.Router()`,
`Backbone.View()`, `Backbone.History()`, and `Backbone.Sync()` won't
function properly. That is, if you don’t include the soft dependencies,
Backbone only offers partial use of models and collections. I suppose
that might be helpful to someone, but it's my opinion that 99 percent of
the time, the soft dependencies will be included along with Backbone.js
(depending upon what browsers you need to support).

An example HTML file that details the Backbone dependencies might look
something like this:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <body>
    <!-- functional programming utility library -->
    <script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/1.3.1/lodash.underscore.js"></script>
    <!-- DOM & XHR utility -->
    <script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <!-- needed for older browsers without window.JSON -->
    <script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/json2/20121008/json2.js"></script>
    <!-- Backbone.js -->
    <script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/1.0.0/backbone-min.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>

It is common, if not required, that you use a dependency manager when
building out a web application (e.g.
[Require.js](http://requirejs.org/)). The HTML example file above is not
a recommendation. Rather, it is being shown to clearly communicate the
Backbone hard and soft dependencies. My opinion is that a dependency
manager should be used when building a single page web application (i.e.
thick client application).

**4.4 - Backbone Runs on the Server Too**

Backbone is useful anywhere you need to structure an application. This
includes server-side applications, as well. The developers behind
Backbone have crafted the library so that it can be [downloaded from
NPM](https://npmjs.org/package/backbone) for Node.js server-side
application development. However, its origins started in the client, and
using it on the server will require some additional knowledge about
running client-centric solutions from a JavaScript backend environment.

**4.5 - `Backbone` is Just a Top-Level Namespace**

The `Backbone` object that is exposed in the global scope is a namespace
which contains Backbone code. Specifically, it contains the `Model()`,
`View()`, `Collection()`, `History()`, and `Router()` constructor
functions, as well as some supporting logic (i.e. `Events` and `sync()`)
for these constructors. The code can be summarized like this:

    (function(){

        var root = this;

        Backbone.VERSION = '1.0.0';

        Backbone.Events = {//events functions to mixed into any object};
        Backbone.Model = function() {//model constructor};
        Backbone.Collection = function() {//collection constructor};
        Backbone.Router = function() {//router constructor};
        Backbone.History = function() {//history constructor};
        Backbone.sync = function() {//sync function};
        Backbone.View = function() {//view constructor};

    }).call(this);

5 - Backbone.Events
-------------------

**5.1 - Backbone.Events Overview**

The `Backbone.Events` object contains methods that facilitate the
[observer design pattern and a variation of the observer pattern called
pub/sub](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh201955.aspx). These
functions permit the various objects created by Backbone (really any
JavaScript object) to communicate with each other in a decoupled manner.
This is done by extending the prototypes (i.e.
`_.extend(Model.prototype, Backbone.Events);`) of the following
constructor functions with the functions contained in `Backbone.Events`:

-   `Backbone.Model()`
-   `Backbone.Collection()`
-   `Backbone.View()`
-   `Backbone.Router()`
-   `Backbone.History()`

If the observer design pattern is meaningless to you and the term
pub/sub is a rather mussy concept, just think of the functions contained
in `Backbone.Events` similar to functionality provided by the jQuery
`$('').on()`, `$('').off()`, `$('').trigger()`, and `$('').one()`
methods for attaching native or custom events to DOM objects with the
added ability to listen to events as well.

The `Backbone.Events` object contains the following functions which
create events, trigger events, and create listening relationships
between objects based on events.

-   `on(event, callback, context)` or `bind()` alias works too
-   `off(event, callback, context)` or `unbind()` alias works too
-   `trigger(event, arguments)`
-   `once(event, callback, context)`
-   `listenTo(other object, event, callback)`
-   `stopListening(other object, event, callback)`
-   `listenToOnce(other object, event, callback)`

In addition to extending the prototype of each of the above constructor
functions, the `Backbone` namespace object itself is extended (i.e.
`_.extend(Backbone, Backbone.Events);`) with the properties found in
`Backbone.Events` so that a global eventing system is available if
needed. For example, below I created a generic `sayHi` event and an
`eavesdropper` object to listen for any `sayHi` events that are
triggered on the Backbone object.

**Notes:**

-   Keep in mind that while I just demonstrated the use of
    `Backbone.Events` in the context of the `Backbone` object, the
    original intention of `Backbone.Events` was to extend the previously
    mentioned Backbone constructor functions with a pattern that would
    allow decoupled communication.

**5.2 - Extending Any Object With Backbone.Events**

As previously mentioned, the `Backbone.Events` object properties are
mixed into the prototype chain of several of the constructor functions
provided by Backbone, as well as the `Backbone` namespace object. Of
course, nothing is stopping you from extending any object with the
functions found in the `Backbone.Events` object. `Backbone.Events`
basically is a standalone set of functions that can be mixed into any
old JavaScript object. Below I demonstrate this by extending the `A`
object and then verifying that the `Backbone.Events` methods are now
properties of `A`.

**5.3 - Binding Events to Objects using `on()`**

The `on()` method will bind a callback function to an object that will
be invoked whenever the event is triggered. In the code below I bind a
`whatsMyName` event to the `A` object and then trigger that event.

**Notes:**

-   A `once(event,callback,context)` method is available that works just
    like `on()` except the event and callback function will be removed
    immediately after being invoked, causing the event and callback to
    occur only once.

**5.4 - Binding Multiple Events with `on()`**

The `on()` accepts a string event parameter which can contain multiple
events separated by a space. Below I add two events to the `A` object,
which call the same function, and then I trigger this callback with the
two different event names.

**5.5 - Name Spacing Events with `on()`**

It is possible to namespace events by using a colon in the event name
followed by the namespace. Below I have added two `say` events with a
unique namespace, which I then use to invoke these name spaced events.

**5.6 - Triggering And Passing Values To A Callback Function Using
`trigger()`**

The `trigger()` method is used to invoke named (i.e. events) callback
functions. Its use has been prevalent in this section. The second
parameter passed to the `trigger()` method gives the option of passing
values to the callback function. Below I trigger a callback function on
`A` to which I pass several values.

Notes:

-   Multiple events can be triggered by providing a space-delimited
    string as the first parameter to `trigger()` listing each event
    you'd like to invoke (i.e. `obj.trigger('event1 event2 event3');`).
-   You can trigger an event on an object that's not actually defined on
    that object and any object listening for this event will still be
    notified that the event has been triggered.

**5.7 - Setting The `this` Context For A Callback Function Using
`on()`**

The third parameter that can be passed to `on()` allows the `this`
context for the callback function to be set. In the code below I invoke
a callback on `A` but tell the value of `this` in the callback to be
`B`.

**5.8 - Removing Events and Callback Functions with `off()`**

The `off()` method can be used in the following 5 ways to remove
individual events, callback functions, or all events from an object.

1 - Removing a named callback function:

2 - Removing all occurrences of an event:

3 - Removing all the occurrences of a named callback function from all
events:

4 - Removing all events for a specific context:

5 - Removing all events and callbacks on an object:

**Notes:**

-   Using `off()` with no parameters on a Backbone model, collection,
    view, or router object will remove everything including the built in
    BackBone events and callbacks.

**5.9 - Have an object listen for events on another object using
`listenTo()`**

The `listenTo()` method gives the ability for one object to listen for
an event on another object, and when that event occurs provide a
callback function that is invoked. In the code example below I tell
object `B` to listen for the `whosListeningToMe` event to occur on
object `A`, and when it does occur invoke the `whosListeningToMe`
callback function.

**Notes:**

-   A `listenToOnce(other,callback,callback)` method is available that
    works just like `listenTo()` except the callback function will be
    removed immediately after being invoked, causing the listen to occur
    only once.
-   When an event is triggered on an object, regardless of if the event
    has a handler on that object, any object listening for the event is
    still notified that the event was triggered.

**5.10 - Stop listening for events on another object using
`stopListening()`**

The `stopListening()` method can be used on objects that are listening
to other objects in the following four ways:

1 - Stop All Listening

2 - Stop listening to a specific object

3 - Stop listening to a specific event on a specific object

4 - Stop Listening to a specific event and callback on a specific object

**5.11 - Backbone Built-in Events**

Backbone triggers the following internal events that have been built in
to models, collections, views, and the router objects. Because Backbone
triggers these events we can make use of these events by way of the
`on()` and `listenTo()` Backbone event methods. More on that in a
minute. For now, just make sure you review the description of individual
events in the table below so you start to gain an understanding of when
these events are triggered.

**model, collection, view, router, and history object events**

  event type   arguments passed to callback   description
  ------------ ------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `'all'`      event name                     this special event fires for *any* (i.e. not just built in events) triggered event, passing the event name as the first argument

**collection object events**

  event type   arguments passed to callback   description
  ------------ ------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  `'add'`      model, collection, options     when a model is added to a collection
  `'remove'`   model, collection, options     when a model is removed from a collection
  `'reset'`    collection, options            when the collection's entire contents have been replaced.
  `'sort'`     collection, options            when the collection has been re-sorted

**model object events**

  event type               arguments passed to callback   description
  ------------------------ ------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `'change'`               model, options                 when a model's attributes have changed.
  `'change:[attribute]'`   model, value, options          when a specific attribute has been updated.
  `'destroy'`              model, collection, options     when a model is [destroyed](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-destroy).
  `'error'`                model, xhr, options            when a model's [save](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-save) call fails on the server.
  `'invalid'`              model, error, options          when a model's [validation](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-validate) fails on the client.

**model or collection object events**

  event type    arguments passed to callback   description
  ------------- ------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------
  `'request'`   model, xhr, options            when a model or collection has started a request to the server.
  `'sync'`      model, resp, options           when a model (or collection) has been successfully synced with the

**router object events**

  event type         arguments passed to callback   description
  ------------------ ------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------
  `'route:[name]'`   params                         Fired by the router when a specific route is matched.
  `'route'`          router, route, params          Fired by history (or router) when *any* route has been matched.

The above events, except for the `'all'` event, will be examined in more
detail in the section that deals with the object that the event is
triggered on. To gain an understanding about Backbone built in events we
will examine the `'all'` event now.

Built in events are triggered by Backbone objects. The `'all'` event is
triggered/broadcasted anytime any event is triggered on a Backbone
model, collection, view, or router.

In the code below I instantiate a Backbone model then I bind (i.e
`on()`) a callback to the `'all'` event. Next, I set some data on the
model. When this data is set, the model will broadcast two events, a
`'change'` event as well as a `'change:attribute'` event (You can verify
this in the table above). The `'all'` event gets fired twice because
it's broadcasted when events, in this case two `'change'` events, are
triggered.

The all event captures, as its first argument, the event that triggered
the `'all'` event. This allows us to log which event triggered the
`'all'` event.

Don't forget, the `'all'` event is not unique to models it is triggered
anytime any of the built in Backbone events are triggered. However, note
that the `'change'` events are specific to models. This example should
lead the way for understanding broadly how all the built in events can
be tapped into when developing Backbone applications.

**5.12 - `Backbone.Events` Conclusion**

The take away from this section is that the concepts used by Backbone
objects to communicate with each other are generic patterns. By
understanding the generic uses provided by Backbone.Events for any
JavaScript object you will be better equipped to understand how to
create your own events, as well as make use of the events that are
internally triggered by Backbone Models, Collections, Views, and the
Router.

6 - Constructing Backbone Objects
---------------------------------

**6.1 - Backbone Constructor Functions**

When I claimed earlier that Backbone itself is simple, I did so because
Backbone only provides 4 constructor functions that are typically
instantiated (technically, they are extended or sub-classed first by a
developer before instantiation).

These four constructors are:

    Backbone.Model = function(attributes, {options}){};
    Backbone.Collection = function([models], {options}){};
    Backbone.Router = function({options}){}; //typically instantiated once 
    Backbone.View = function({options}){};

Let's examine the default instance and prototype properties for each of
the instances created from the above constructor functions by simply
instantiating each with the `new` keyword (click on the results in the
JSfiddles to view instance and prototype properties) passing no
parameters.

Models:

Collection:

Router:

View:

The properties identified for each constructor function are what
Backbone provides out of the box. However, it is more common that you
will be extending (i.e. `Backbone.Model.extend()`) these constructors
with your own domain specific instance and prototype properties and
methods before you construct them.

Briefly, before we continue, let's examine the optional parameters for
each constructor. More time will be spent on these parameters in the
appropriate section but I think it's important to have a rough
understanding of the optional parameters.

    var myModel = new Backbone.Model(attributes, {options});
    /*
    attributes = {data:value, data:value} || [value,value]

    options = {
     collection: {}, 
     url: '', 
     urlRoot: '', 
     parse: boolean
    }
    */


    var myCollection = new Backbone.Collection(model(s), {options});
    /*
    models = model || [model,model,model] || {model:data} || [{model:data},{model:data}];

    options = {
     url: '', 
     model: {}, 
     comparator: function(){} || ''
    }
    */


    var myView = new Backbone.View({options});
    /*
    options = {
     model: {}, 
     events: {} or function(){return {}}
     collection: {}, 
     el: '' or function(){return ''}, 
     id: '', 
     className: '' or function(){return ''}, 
     tagName: '' or function(){return ''}, 
     attributes: {attribute:value,attribute:value}
    }
    */


    var myRouter = new Backbone.Router({options});
    /*
    options = {
     routes:{}
    }
    */

    /*should be aware of History options as well*/
    Backbone.History.start({options});
    /*
    options = {
     pushState: boolean,
     root: '',
     hashChange: boolean,
     silent: boolean
    }
    */

**Notes:**

-   The `Router()` constructor can be instantiated more than once but
    given the assumption of a SPA typically its only instantiated once.
-   The `Backbone.History()` constructor function is [internally
    constructed by the library
    itself](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#section-188), one
    time, when the library is parsed.
-   Notice that all of the instances, as previously mentioned, have the
    `Backbone.Events` mixed into the prototypes of each constructor.

**6.2 - Using The Internal Backbone `extend()` Helper Function To Create
Sub Classed Model(), Collection(), Router(), and View() Constructors.**

The Backbone pattern for constructing a model, collection, view, or
router routinely involves extending one of the default Backbone
constructor functions (creating a sub class or sub constructor) with
your own domain relevant properties and methods. This is accomplished
with the [`extend()`
function](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#section-190) that is
[a property of the constructor
function](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#section-196). Don't
confuse this function with the `extend()` provided by underscore.js.

The `extend()` provided by Backbone accomplishes, from a high level, the
following:

-   Duplicates the instance values of the constructor function its
    extending
-   Extends the new sub constructor with developer defined prototype\
     properties and static properties
-   Facilitates the prototypical inheritance between the constructor
    being extended and the new constructor (sub-constructor)
-   Adds the `extend()` helper function to the new sub constructor
    function so that the sub constructor can also be extended to create
    an unlimited chain of sub classes
-   Institutes an `initialize()` callback to be called when the
    sub-constructor creates instances and sets the context of the
    initialize function.

For a more detailed break down of how the Backbone `extend()` method
works, carefully read the comments in the code below which describes the
logic contained in the `extend()` function for extending a fictitious
`View` constructor (similar but not precisely `Backbone.View`). While
this is not the exact code contained in Backbone.js its an isolated
example of what is occuring at the code level when a `Backbone.Model`,
`Backbone.Collection`, `Backbone.View`, and `Backbone.Router`
constructor is sub classed (or what I like to call an extended sub
constructor) .

Understanding `extend()`, and its role when using Backbone will take a
lot of the mystery out of Backbone applications. I would suggest you
examine its parts until you completely understand its purpose and
function, but if you want to move past this subject quickly what you
need to know about extend() boils down to one concept.

1.  `extend()`, creates or extends an object with new application
    specific object properties so that when the extended object is
    instantiated it will have these new instance properties and methods.

**6.3 - Running Initialization Code When An Extended Constructor Is
Instantiated**

When `extend()`'ing `Backbone.Model`, `Backbone.Collection`,
`Backbone.View`, and `Backbone.Router` an `initialize` function can be
setup to run anytime an instance is created from the extended
constructor. Basically, initialize is a callback, which is invoked any
time an instance is instantiated. In the code below I provide an
initialize callback for an extended `Backbone.Model` constructor and
then create an instance, which in turn runs the initialized function
(works the same on `Backbone.Collection`, `Backbone.View`, and
`Backbone.Router`).

Make sure you note that any parameters passed to an extended constructor
are also passed into the initialize callback.

**Notes:**

-   The context of the initialize function (i.e. `this`) is set to the
    instance created.
-   When extending a Backbone constructor you have to be aware of what
    parameters and values the constructor permits/requires when
    instantiating an instance. For example, the `Backbone.Model`
    constructor expects as the first parameter an object containing the
    data to be stored in the Model (i.e. attributes). The second
    parameter is an object containing instantiation options. You can add
    additional parameters and they are simply passed on to the
    initialize function.

**6.4 - Overriding The Constructor Being Extended**

When using `extend()` if you pass a property called 'constructor' with a
function as its value, this function will be used instead of the
function the `extend()` is a property of. In the code below I am
extending not the `Model` constructor, but the constructor function I am
passing in.

In the code above `myModel` still inherits the `Model()` prototype
properties, just not the instance properties (i.e. `cid`). If you
override the constructor, but want to keep instance properties from the
constructor you are calling `extend()` from, you need to run
`Backbone.[CONSTRUCTOR].apply(this, arguments);` in the custom
constructor\*/

7 - Backbone.Router
-------------------

**7.1 - Backbone.Router() Overview**

A Backbone route is a JavaScript string, which resembles what
traditionally has been considered a URL
[pathname](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.location).
This pathname-like string is the property name for a function (or
reference to a named function) that is invoked when the url in the
browser matches the string. For example, the url below contains the
pathname "help" and in a single page Backbone application this would
tell Backbone to invoke the function that is associated with the route
called 'help'.

    http://www.hostname.com/#help

Notice that the pathname "help" isn't actually a
[pathname](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.location),
it is actually a
[hash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier). Backbone
defaults to using hash paths because as of today its the most widely
supported solution for creating unique URL strings without causing a
browser to reload. When you no longer need to support ie 9 or below you
can tell Backbone to use the newer HTML5
[history.pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history)
which eliminates the need for hash paths. The `history.pushState` api
updates the browser history and permits the modification of the URL
pathname without causing the browser to reload. I will talk more about
this later in this section. For now, let's look at an actual Backbone
route.

In the code below I create an instance of the default
`Backbone.Router()` and then define a "help" route using the `route()`
method.

In the code example above when the hash changes to `#help` Backbone is
aware of this change and takes everything after the `#` and matches that
to a predefined string name (i.e. "help") which is associated with a
callback function.

Routes are essentially pathname like strings in a URL that are monitored
by Backbone for string matches. When a match is found a corresponding
function is invoked.

**Notes:**

-   Routes by default rely on the
    [hashchange](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.onhashchange)
    event and the hash portion of a url. If Backbone is configured to
    use `history.pushState()` then the
    [popstate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.onpopstate?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=DOM/window.onpopstate)
    event and normal pathnames are used if available, but will default
    back to hash's if its not. If Backbone detects that neither of these
    events are available it will resort to
    [polling](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#section-172) the
    url and checking to see if the URL has changed.

**7.2 - Starting Routing Management with `Backbone.history.start()`**

To have Backbone begin managing url changes (i.e. call default route,
listen for routes, manage browser history, and deal with back button)
you will need to call the `Backbone.history.start()`. The details for
this method can be found in the section that talks about
`Backbone.History`. For now, just realize that Backbone has to manually
tell the browser to start the routing process. In the code below I setup
a 'help' route but a change to the url is not monitored by Backbone
until `Backbone.history.start()` is invoked.

**7.3 - Backbone Initial Route**

The initial route is the route that runs when `Backbone.history.start()`
is invoked. The initial route is defined by sending the router an empty
string route name signifying that this route should run by default (i.e.
the root) when routing begins. In the code example below I define an
initial route that is called after `Backbone.history.start()` is
invoked.

**Notes:**

-   To kick off routing without the initial route being invoked pass the
    `{silence:true}` to the `.start()` method.

**7.4 - Defining Routes**

Up to this point the routing code examples have been defining routes
using the `route()` method after the instantiation of a
`Backbone.Router()` instance. To be comprensive, defining routes can
occur not just by way of the `route()` method but in the following four
ways (including the `route()` method):

1 - When Extending `Backbone.Router` Using `routes` Option:

2 - When Instantiating A Router Using `routes` Option:

3 - After An Instance Is Created Using The route() Method:

4 - During Initialization Of An Instance Using The route() Method:

**7.5 - Running Routes With Wildcard Pathnames (aka splats or \*)**

A wildcard pathname can be used to indicate that any pathname will cause
the route to run. For example, the route `'*anyURL'` will run anytime a
url is changed.

And the route `'/help/*'` will run anytime the url changes to
`'help/ANYTHING/ANYTHING'`.

**Notes:**

-   Passing a splat route alone (i.e. `'*'`), today, causes Backbone to
    throw an error.

**7.6 - Passing Parameters From The URL To The Routes Callback
Function**

To identify url parts that should be considered parameters simply place
a `:` in front of the name of the parameter contained in the route
string. For example in the code below I pass the search route callback
function, 4 parameters.

Notes:

-   If you surround the url parameters in `()` then this becomes an
    optional parameter, without the `()` the url will only run if it
    contains all of the parameters defined in the route string.

**7.7 - Using A Regular Expression With `route()` to Match A URL**

The `route()` method optionally accepts as its first parameter a regular
expression value instead of a string value. This can be pretty handy
when you'd like to finely tune the matching of urls. In the code example
below I demonstrate the matching of a route for a specific range of
words.

**7.8 - Routing Broadcasts A Built In `'route:CALLBACK-NAME'` Event**

When a route is match and the callback function is called a built in
`'route`' event, with a namespace referring to the name of the callback
invoked is dispatched/broadcasted by Backbone. The `on()` or
`listenTo()` event methods can be used to tap into the
`'route:NAMEOFCALLBACKFUNCTION'` event.

In the code below I am using `on()` or `listenTo()` to monitor and
invoke additional callback functions when the `search` callback is
invoked.

Notice that both `on()` or `listenTo()` pass along any url parameters.

**Note:**

-   In addition to the built int `'route:CALLBACK-NAME'` on route
    objects there is also a `'route'` event that gets dispatched anytime
    a route has been matched.

**7.9 - Manually Navigating Routes using `navigate()`**

Up to this point I've mostly been invoking routes in the code example by
changing the `window.location.hash` value in the browser, which Backbone
is monitoring. By using the `navigate()` method we can accomplish the
same thing. In the code below instead of update the hash value in the
browser I am going to invoke the `navigate()` method passing it the
route string to navigate too.

**Notes:**

-   By default, `navigate()` will update the url in the browser (and
    deal with history and back button) but not invoke the route callback
    function. To update the url in the browser and invoke the callback
    associated with the route you must pass the `trigger:true` option to
    `navigate()`.
-   By default, `navigate()` assumes you want to change the url and\
     update the browser's history. If you'd prefer not to update the
    browser history (which is used by the back button) you can pass the
    replace:true option to `navigate()`. This will simply replace the
    current url without updating the browsers history.

8 - Backbone.History
--------------------

The `Backbone.Router` is responsible for managing routes. The
`Backbone.history` is part of routing and responsible for listening and
responding to URL changes, including updates to the browsers history.
The `Backbone.History()` constructor is instantiated by the Backbone
library itself and an instance of `History()` is [referenced
from](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#section-188)
`Backbone.history`. The object that is placed at `Backbone.history` has
one method named `start()`. Calling this method tells Backbone to begin
listening for routes and to start managing the browser history. This
method takes an options object with the following options and values.

    Backbone.history.start({

    /*Boolean, default is false, true means use pushState if available and fallback to hash paths if needed.*/
    pushState: true,

    /*Boolean, default is true, a value of false if pushState is true means that browsers that don't support pushState will do a traditional browser reload based on URL pathname.  If pushState is false and hashChange is false then url changes will do a traditional browser reload based on URL pathname. */
    hashChange: false,

    /*String, default is '' and backbone assumes you are serving if from the root url (i.e. /).  A value other than '' is a string path to the directory your application is being server from and the directory Backbone should consider the root directory. */ 
    root:'',

    /* Boolean, default is false, a true value means don't run the default route (i.e.''). */
    silent: true

    });

You'll likely never create a `History()` instance in your code, but keep
in mind that you'll almost always need to invoke
`Backbone.history.start()` in order to begin monitoring hashchange
events and invoke route callbacks.

**Notes:**

-   Due to a reliance on iframes to make hash paths work in IE its best
    if `start()` is invoked after the DOM is ready.
-   When calling `start()` the first time, it will run the initial
    route. The initial route is the current url when `.start()` is
    called, which in turn invokes the route that is associated with any
    empty string property name.
-   You don't have to have all of your routes defined before you call
    `start()`. If you don't use an initial route you can define all
    routes after `start()` with the `route()` method available on
    `Backbone.Router()` instances.
-   It's not exactly intuitive, but routing is not started from a
    `Backbone.router()` instance its started from the
    `Backbone.history()` instance. Just remember that router objects
    define routes and provides a `navigate()` method but in order for
    routing to start for each web page loaded into a browser, you have
    to invoke `Backbone.history.start()`.

9 - Backbone Utilities
----------------------

**9.1 - Restore and Create A Unique (i.e. custom namespace) Reference to
Backbone with `Backbone.noConflict()`**

When Backbone is being parsed by the browser, one of the first things
Backbone will do is store a reference to the value contained at
`Backbone` in the Global scope (i.e. typically at `window.Backbone`).
This is because Backbone will overwrite or take over this namespace and
wants to give the developer the option to restore the previous value
used before the Backbone library is parsed. This is where the
`Backbone.noConflict()` function comes into play. Calling it will return
the `Backbone` namespace to the previous owner and then return a
reference to the last parsed version of Backbone.js so you can create a
new namespace for it. In the code below I create a fictitious Backbone
version before Backbone.js is loaded

    <script>

        this.Backbone = {
        "I'm the previous owner of Backbone in the global scope": true
        };

    </script>

and use `Backbone.noConflict()` to make sure this version remains
reference from Backbone while giving the last parsed version of Backbone
a new namespace.

**Notes:**

-   If you call `Backbone.noConflict()` and don't store the reference
    value returned from the function call you've lost a reference to the
    last Backbone.js code that was parsed by the browser.

**9.2 - Assign the DOM & XHR library used by Backbone with
`Backbone.$`**

[Backbone will internally and automatically use any version of jQuery,
Zepto, or ender (in that order) found in the global scope for DOM
manipulation and XHR (aka
AJAX)](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#section-9) by storing a
reference to one of these libraries at `Backbone.$`.

If none of these libraries are found in the global scope, Backbone will
attempt to use whatever value is found in the global scope for `$`,
which could be `undefined` if you don't include one of the previously
mentioned libraries or define your own library which uses `$` as a
namespace or alias.

One can also manually provide a value for `Backbone.$` after Backbone
has been parsed. In the code example below I demonstrate how
`Backbone.$` can be set by either method.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <body>
    <!-- functional programming utility library -->
    <script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/1.3.1/lodash.underscore.js"></script>
    <!-- needed for older browsers without window.JSON -->
    <script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/json2/20121008/json2.js"></script>
    <!-- DOM & XHR utility -->
    <script>
    //Backbone will use this if jQuery, Zepto, and ender don't claim $
    var $ = {version:'0.0.1',name:'MyReCreateTheWheelDOM&AJAXLib'}
    </script>
    <!-- Backbone.js -->
    <script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/1.0.0/backbone-min.js"></script>
    <!-- DOM & XHR utility -->
    <script>
    //Or just Manually set it after Backbone is loaded
    Backbone.$ = {version:'0.0.1',name:'MyReCreateTheWheelDOM&AJAXLib'}
    </script>
    </body>
    </html>

**10 - Conclusion**

[I've read and watched a great deal of tutorials on
Backbone.js](http://readlists.com/f1c7b9ca/) and none of them provided a
comprehensive foundation (all the parts around the meat) for grokking
the function of a `Backbone.Model`,`Backbone.Collection`, and
`Backbone.View`. It was my intention to alleviate this gap of
information with the contents of this article.

With a thorough Backbone backdrop set into place by this article we will
move on to the main stage actors,
`Backbone.Model`,`Backbone.Collection`, `Backbone.View` and
`Backbone.sync` in the second part of this article.

    I gotta say Cody, wish you had written this months ago when i was
    jumping from one "TODO"-ish tutorial to another. 4.5 finally made it
    click for me.

    You answered questions every beginner should ask (but probably don't
    understand enough to). Almost like you journaled your personal
    experience while learning Backbone or you have answered a lot of
    questions from beginners. Either way, Awesome job! Looking forward
    to part 2.

        Thanks for the feedback. My writings typically never exclude the
        mental state of someone new to the information. I work very hard
        to be exhaustive and systematic.

        Great approach. The learning curve for libraries like Backbone
        are steep. A lot of people think they are ready for OO
        Javascript because they have used jQuery plugins . All those
        closures and knee-deep object literals hurt the brain at first.

    Hey Cody,

    Sorry I didn't get my feedback to you in time to make this post.
    Here's some of the relevant notes I took:

    -   Mention that Backbone Event's namespacing is purely a convention
        and does nothing special.
    -   In your example you link to minified files which is a poor
        practice for development, almost impossible to debug errors if
        they trigger within the library source.
    -   Maybe mention how Lo-Dash strays from Underscore in many ways
        instead of just using `_.assign` as an example of where it
        differs.
