Mobile Gadgets That Connect to Wi-Fi without a Battery
======================================================

Simple devices that can link up via Wi-Fi but don’t need batteries could
make it easier to spread computing throughout your home.

-   By [Tom Simonite](/contributor/tom-simonite/) on August 1, 2014

Why It Matters
--------------

The expense and lifespans of batteries limit what can be done with
mobile computing devices.

![image](http://www.technologyreview.com/sites/default/files/images/battery.free_.wifix299.jpg)

**Air power:** This antenna harvests signals from TV, radio, and
cellular transmissions so that small Wi-Fi devices can get by without
batteries.

A new breed of mobile wireless device lacks a battery or other energy
storage, but it can still send data over Wi-Fi. These prototype gadgets,
developed by researchers at the University of Washington, get all the
power they need by making use of the Wi-Fi, TV, radio, and cellular
signals that are already in the air.

The technology could free engineers to extend the tendrils of the
Internet and computers into corners of the world they don’t currently
reach. Battery-free devices that can communicate could make it much
cheaper and easier to widely deploy sensors inside homes to take control
of heating and other services.

Smart thermostats on the market today, such as the Nest, are limited by
the fact that they can sense temperature only in their immediate
location. Putting low-cost, Wi-Fi-capable, and battery-free sensors
behind couches and cabinets could provide the detailed data needed to
make such thermostats more effective. “You could throw these things
wherever you want and never have to think about them again,” says [Shyam
Gollakota](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/), an assistant
professor at the University of Washington who worked on [the
project](http://iotwifi.cs.washington.edu).

The battery-free Wi-Fi devices are an upgrade to a design the same group
demonstrated last year—those devices could only talk to other devices
like themselves (see “[Devices Connect with Borrowed TV Signals and Need
No Power
Source](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/518111/devices-connect-with-borrowed-tv-signals-and-need-no-power-source/)”).
Versions were built that could power LEDs, motion detectors,
accelerometers, and touch-sensitive buttons.

Adding Wi-Fi capabilities makes the devices more practical. Gollakota
hopes to establish a company to commercialize the technology, which
should also be applicable to other wireless protocols, such as Zigbee or
Bluetooth, that are used in compact devices without access to wired
power sources, he says. A paper on the new devices will be presented at
the [ACM Sigcomm](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2014/)
conference in Chicago in August.

Engineers have worked for decades on ways to generate power by
harvesting radio signals from the air, a ubiquitous resource thanks to
radio, TV, and cellular network transmitters. But although enough energy
can be collected that way to run low-powered circuits, the power
required to actively transmit data is significantly higher. Harvesting
ambient radio waves can collect on the order of tens of microwatts of
power. But sending data over Wi-Fi requires at least tens of thousands
of times more power—hundreds of milliwatts at best and typically around
one watt of power, says Gollakota.

The Washington researchers got around that challenge by finding a way to
have the devices communicate without having to actively transmit. Their
devices send messages by scattering signals from other sources—they
recycle existing radio waves instead of expending energy to generate
their own.

To send data to a smartphone, for example, one of the new prototypes
switches its antenna back and forth between modes that absorb and
reflect the signal from a nearby Wi-Fi router. Software installed on the
phone allows it to read that signal by observing the changing strength
of the signal it detects from that same router as the battery-free
device soaks some of it up.

The battery-free Wi-Fi devices can’t harvest enough energy to receive
and decode Wi-Fi signals in the conventional way. But they can detect
the presence of the individual units, or “packets,” that make up a Wi-Fi
transmission. To send data to the battery-free device, a conventional
Wi-Fi device sends a specific burst of packets that lets the receiving
device know it should listen for a transmission. The data is then is
encoded in a stream of further packets with gaps interspersed between
them. Each packet signals a 1 and each gap a 0 of the digital message.

[Ranveer Chandra](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/ranveer), a
senior researcher in mobile computing at Microsoft Research, says the
technology could help accelerate dreams of being able to deploy cheap,
networked devices that have been slow to arrive. “Given the prevalence
of Wi-Fi, this provides a great way to get low-power Internet of things
devices to communicate with a large swath of devices around us,” he
says. RFID tags, which also lack batteries, are the closest technology
in use today, says Chandra. But they can only communicate with
specialized reader devices, he says. The Washington approach fits better
with existing infrastructure.

However, increasing the range of the system will be important for it to
be widely useful, notes Chandra. The upcoming paper on the technology
reports a range of only 65 centimeters, which barely spans a small
table, let alone a single room in a house. Gollakota says that in
recent, still unpublished experiments, the range has been extended to
just over two meters, and 10 meters and beyond should be possible.
