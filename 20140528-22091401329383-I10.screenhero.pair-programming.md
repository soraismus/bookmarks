Remote Pair Programming Tips Using RubyMine and Screenhero
==========================================================

May 6th, 2014 | [Comments](#disqus_thread)

I had the opportunity to spend the entire workday remote pair
programming from my office in Maui with a San Francisco client from
[Cloud City Development](http://www.cloudcity.io/). We used our normal
tools of [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/), Chrome, and iTerm2
on a 27” Cinema Display shared via [Screenhero](http://screenhero.com/).
While remote will probably never be 100% as good as true in-person
pairing, it’s getting very close! Here’s some tips for effective remote
pair programming. Scroll down to the bottom for the TLDR if you’re short
on time. Overall, I would highly recommend remote pairing with RubyMine
on a full 27” Cinema Display, using an iPad with a Google Hangout for
eye contact!

Here’s a very detailed video of how to do remote collaboration:

Telepresence Using Video Chat on iPad
-------------------------------------

Per the recommendation of [Tim Connor](https://twitter.com/timocratic)
of [Cloud City Development](http://www.cloudcity.io/), I started using
an iPad for [telepresence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepresence)
for **only the video**, using **[Google
Hangouts](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/)**, muting the
microphone on the Hangout, and using the audio on
[Screenhero](http://screenhero.com/). While one can run Google Hangouts
on the laptop, it can really suck up the CPU. Note, an iPhone or
probably an Android phone or table would work equally as well. In terms
of the audio, the microphone and speakers are better on the computer. If
one is using the laptop for the telepresence video, and using multiple
screens, it’s key to use the camera on the screen where one will be
looking at the Hangout, and not at the Screenhero screen. As shown from
the below pictures, it’s key that it’s obvious when the pairing partners
are looking at each other versus at Screenhero. Incidentally, Screenhero
did not suffer from any degradation when combined with the Google
Hangout, regardless of using the Hangout on the laptop or mobile device.

In the below images, note where our eyes are focused.

Screenhero
----------

We both used [Screenhero](http://screenhero.com/) on Macs. I’ve done
plenty of remote pair programming using Google Hangouts, but typically
only one person sharing the screen drives the code. Screenhero allows
true screen sharing such that both programmers can do the typing and
mousing. With the shared screen being a 27” Cinema display, I set my
Screenhero window to *full screen* and the resolution was nearly
perfect. Yes, when scrolling and switching apps, there is a slight
delay, but it was extremely manageable to the point that I almost would
forget that I’m working on a computer 3000 miles away. Although there’s
a slight slowness in seeing keys that you type, it’s minor enough that
it’s not a nuisance. The dual cursor support works great. Here’s a
[video demo of the dual cursor
support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BojQaD64GU).

RubyMine IDE
------------

Both I and my pairing partners were already using
[RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/), so using RubyMine was a
natural choice over trying to pair with the conventional remote pairing
setup of tmux and Vim. RubyMine combined with Screenhero, the same size
big screens, fast computers, and very good broadband resulted in a
productive pairing setup. One thing I hear about Vim setups is that pair
programmers tend to not customize their Vim keymaps. With RubyMine,
that’s not an issue thanks to a feature called “Quick Switch Scheme”
which allows very fast switching of keyboard bindings. I’m a Vim user
(IdeaVim), and I would have been crippled without my favorite RubyMine
Vim bindings. I like the “Quick Switch” feature so much that I made [a
short screencast on this
feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57xOTXF78w&noredirect=1),
displayed below.

Fast Broadband
--------------

I use a combination of the fastest cable and the fastest DSL I can buy
in Maui, served on a load-balancing [ZyXEL ZyWall USG 50
Router](http://www.amazon.com/ZyXEL-Internet-Security-Firewall-Dual-WAN/dp/B0042WCFI2).
DSL is far slower than the cable service, but I still keep it for the
one day that cable is not working right. As an additional backup, I have
a Verizon LTE tethering plan for my iPhone 5, so the chances that I’m
totally out of Internet are low. Here’s a screenshot from
[http://www.speedtest.net/](http://www.speedtest.net/)

Same Big Monitors
-----------------

We both used [Apple 27” Cinema
Displays](https://www.apple.com/displays/). On the receiving side of the
share, I’m using a 2012 loaded Retina MacBook Pro with SSD.

Audio Setup
-----------

I use a [Blue Yeti USB Microphone Silver
Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Yeti-USB-Microphone/dp/B002VA464S/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1399442515&sr=1-1&keywords=blue+yeti+microphone)
mounted on a [Heil PL-2T Overhead Broadcast
Boom](http://www.amazon.com/Heil-Sound-PL-2T-Overhead-Broadcast/dp/B000SZVZ74/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1399442457&sr=1-1&keywords=heil+pl2t)
with a [Blue Microphones The Pop Universal Pop
Filter](http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Pop-Universal-Filter/dp/B0002H0H4A/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1399442563&sr=1-1&keywords=blue+yeti+pop+filter).
(At the time of writing this article, the pop filter is only $25.22 on
Amazon Prime, regular price $79.00, totally worth it!). This is the
setup I use for podcasting so it’s more than adequate for pairing. I use
the audio from the Display Monitor (Cinema Screen), as that’s behind the
mic, so as not to cause any echoing. Naturally, this only works in a
private office. In a shared office, it’s critical to have a very good
mic/headset combo or a good mic. The Blue Snowball mic does a pretty
good job of filtering out background noise.

I did a quick search on Amazon to see what’s available for headsets. If
budget allows (and if you’re spending a fair bit of time pairing), I’d
consider the [V-MODA Crossfade LP Over-Ear Noise-Isolating Metal
Headphone (Gunmetal
Black)](http://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-Crossfade-Over-Ear-Noise-Isolating-Headphone/dp/B003BYRGKY/ref=sr_1_1?s=aht&ie=UTF8&qid=1399443063&sr=1-1&keywords=headset+with+microphone)
plus the [V-MODA BoomPro Gaming, VoIP Headset Headphone with Mic,
Black](http://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Gaming-Headset-Headphone/dp/B00BJ17WKK/ref=pd_bxgy_e_img_y)
as both have a very high number of 4+ reviews. It’s suspect that with
the right audio setup, the avoidance of distractions for an
in-office/remote pair combo might be superior to that of the in-office
pair combo. Please post into the comments if you have advice on the best
headset for pairing.

TLDR Miscellaneous Tips
-----------------------

1.  Use [Screenhero](http://screenhero.com/) for screen sharing.
2.  Use [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/)
    or Facetime on a mobile device to share video of each other. Prefer
    that over using Google Hangouts on your computer due to CPU usage of
    Google Hangouts. I really like the iPad mini with the Apple folding
    cover. It fits right under the Cinema
3.  Use large screen for screen sharing, an tablet for Google Hangouts.
4.  Don’t be afraid to try your regular tools, such as
    [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/).
5.  Use fast broadband, fast Macs, same size monitors.
6.  A good audio setup is well worth it.
7.  If the computer sharing the desktop has multiple monitors enabled,
    then the remote sharing viewer might not be able to use command-tab
    to switch applications. This problem went away when there was only
    one monitor on the computer doing the sharing. It might depend upon
    whether the cmd-tab is showing on the shared screen.
8.  If using RubyMine, install your pair’s keybinding into your RubyMine
    preferences. You can copy the keybinding xml file located in
    `~/Library/Preferences/RubyMine60/keymaps` and then restart
    RubyMine.
9.  Consider putting Screenhero in Full Screen mode to avoid any
    compression of the window pixels. This is especially important when
    trying to click or drag on the remote machine, such as resizing the
    chrome inspector area.
10. Don’t forget to take a break for water, stretch, etc. every so
    often!
