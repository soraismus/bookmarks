### Inequality v growth

Up to a point, redistributing income to fight inequality can lift growth
========================================================================

Mar 1st 2014 | [From the print edition](/printedition/2014-03-01)

-   -   [Tweet](http://twitter.com/share)

ON THE campaign trail in 2008 Barack Obama stumbled into a memorable
encounter with Joe “the Plumber” Wurzelbacher. Explaining the logic of a
proposal to raise taxes on the rich, Mr Obama mused that “when you
spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody”. The soundbite, soon
an attack-ad mainstay, failed to derail the Obama campaign. But the
disagreement between Joe the Plumber and Barack the Senator still trips
up governments around the world: is there a trade-off between economic
growth and redistribution?

Some inequality is needed to propel growth, economists reckon. Without
the carrot of large financial rewards, risky entrepreneurship and
innovation would grind to a halt. In 1975 Arthur Okun, an American
economist, argued that societies cannot have both perfect equality and
perfect efficiency and must choose how much of one to sacrifice for the
other.

While most economists continue to hold that view, the recent rise in
inequality has prompted a new look at its economic costs. Inequality
could impair growth if those with low incomes suffer poor health and low
productivity as a result. It could threaten public confidence in
growth-boosting policies like free trade, reckons Dani Rodrik, of the
Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton. Or it could sow the seeds of
crisis. In a 2010 book Raghuram Rajan, now governor of the Reserve Bank
of India, argued that governments often respond to inequality by easing
the flow of credit to poorer households. When the borrowing binge ends
everyone suffers.

Pinning down the precise relationship between growth and inequality is a
challenge. Some studies reckon inequality is mildly bad for growth.
Others suggest the relationship changes as poor countries grow rich,
while still others reckon it is the trend in inequality rather than its
level that matters.

Research by economists at the International Monetary Fund aims to add
clarity to the debate. In a 2011 paper Andrew Berg and Jonathan Ostry
argued that it is the duration of spells of growth that is most
important for long-run economic performance: getting an economy growing
in the first place is much easier than keeping the growth spell rolling.
They reckon that when growth falters, inequality is often a culprit.
Latin America’s Gini index is about 50, well above that in emerging
Asia, which has a Gini of about 40. (A Gini index is a measure of income
concentration that ranges from 0, representing perfect equality to 100,
where all income flows to a single person.) Were Latin America to close
half of that gap in inequality, its typical growth spurt might last
twice as long, on average.

Others reckon that it may not be inequality itself that harms growth but
rather governments that tax and spend to try to reduce it. In a new
paper Messrs Berg and Ostry and Charalambos Tsangarides tease out the
separate effects of inequality and redistribution. They turn to a data
set put together by Frederick Solt, a political scientist at the
University of Iowa, containing Gini indices for 173 economies spanning a
period of five decades. Mr Solt provides Ginis for both market income
and net income (after taxes and transfers). The difference between the
two gives the authors a measure of redistribution (see chart). In
America, which does relatively little of it, redistribution trims the
Gini index by roughly ten points. In Sweden, in contrast, it cuts the
Gini by 23 points—more than half. Using these figures, the economists
can separate out the different effects of redistribution and inequality
on growth.

Redistributing prejudice

The authors find that governments in more unequal countries redistribute
more, and rich economies do more than poor ones. As a result,
differences in inequality across rich countries are mostly down to the
generosity of redistribution; Germany is more unequal than Britain
before redistribution but much less so after.

Up to a point, spreading the wealth around carries no growth penalty:
growth in income per person is not meaningfully lower in countries with
more redistribution. But economies that redistribute a lot may enjoy
shorter growth spells, the authors reckon. When the gap between the
market and net Ginis is 13 points or more (as in much of western Europe)
further redistribution shrinks the typical expansion. The authors
caution against drawing hasty conclusions. Details surely matter;
nationalising firms and doling out profits would presumably be worse for
growth than taxing property to fund education.

Inequality is more closely correlated with low growth. A high Gini for
net income, after redistribution, corresponds to slower growth in income
per person. A rise of 5 Gini points (moving from the level in America to
that in Gabon, for instance) knocks half a percentage point off average
annual growth. And holding redistribution constant, a one-point rise in
the Gini raises the risk an expansion ends in a given year by six
percentage points. Redistribution that reduces inequality might
therefore boost growth.

If redistribution is benign, that could be because it substitutes for
shaky borrowing. In their 2011 paper Messrs Berg and Ostry note that
more unequal societies do poorly on social indicators such as
educational attainment, even after controlling for income levels. This
suggests that households with lower incomes struggle to finance
investments in education. In a recent paper Barry Cynamon of the Federal
Reserve Bank of St Louis and Steven Fazzari of Washington University in
St Louis reckon most Americans borrowed heavily before 2008 to prop up
their consumption. That kept the economy growing—until crisis struck.
Sensible redistribution could mean the difference between a healthy
growth rate and one that is decidedly subprime.
