Rails unit-testing best practices

At Rainforest, we love testing as it is the best way to ship high
quality software. In addition to using [Rainforest
tests](https://www.rainforestqa.com/), we use a bunch of testing tools
for our Rails applications. In this [Deployment
Academy](/categories/deployment-academy) post, I’ll share the core
elements of that toolset.

RSpec
-----

Let’s start with the core tool in our testing:
[RSpec](https://relishapp.com/rspec). I loved RSpec the minute I
discovered it years ago. It has a really nice syntax that is easy to
pick up and really clear to read. Yes, it’s not the only option (e.g.
[minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) which ships with
Ruby). This is almost a religion to some people, but we love RSpec.

Here is what an RSpec test can look like:

~~~~ {.highlight .ruby}
describe Client do
  let(:client) { create(:client) }

  describe '#active?' do
    context "when the client is active" do
      it { expect(client.active?).to be_true }
    end

    context "when the client is inactive" do
      let(:client) { create(:client, :inactive) }

      it { expect(client.active?).to be_false }
    end
  end
end
~~~~

Isn’t that nice and clear? I love it!

Factory Girl
------------

This is the `create(:client, :inactive)` part of the previous example.
It is a great tool to create fake data for your tests. Some people will
prefer fixtures, but we prefer to actually hit the database because we
find it to be more reliable.

[Factory Girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl) has a nice,
descriptive way of declaring factories:

~~~~ {.highlight .ruby}
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :client do
    name "John Doe"
    state "active"

    trait :inactive do
      state "inactive"
    end
  end
end
~~~~

Database Cleaner
----------------

What happens with all that fake data you ask me? There are a few
possibilities but what we prefer is using the [Database
Cleaner](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner) gem. It
gives you different options in terms of cleaning the database before
each test. Different strategies are available but we use transactions,
it’s just rolled back and never committed.

I want my results, NOW!
-----------------------

Those tools are all great, right? But that’s not all! To be really
efficient, you want to have feedback as fast as possible. You want to
know if your tests and your code are working or not.

I have found that the following combo is really efficient:

-   [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) and
    [guard-rspec](https://github.com/guard/guard-rspec)
-   [Spring](https://github.com/rails/spring) or
    [Zeus](https://github.com/burke/zeus)
-   [terminal-notifier-guard](https://github.com/Springest/terminal-notifier-guard)

### Guard and guard-rspec

The first one, Guard, will watch your files and do stuff whenever they
change. With guard-rspec, it will run the RSpec specs related to the
file you changed, and only those. Not enough for you? If you had failed
tests on the previous save, it will run only the failed specs the next
time, until it’s green. You can even have guard-rspec kick off the whole
suite if you want after having fixed your specs, but I personally prefer
to kick off full runs “manually” by pressing *enter* in the Guard
terminal.

### Spring or Zeus

These make sure your full Rails environment doesn’t get reloaded before
every run. That’s a MAJOR bump in efficiency. **If you try just one
tool, it’s one of these!**

Spring is now enabled by default in new Rails projects (4.1+), but you
can add it to your current project easily. Zeus is built in Go and has
been around for a little while now. They both serve the same purpose:
making sure you don’t have to wait long for your tests to run.

### terminal-notifier-guard

The last one that will make you faster is terminal-notifier-guard. The
name is descriptive, but let me explain: this will display your test
results in a nice OSX notification like this:

![RSpec results in OSX
notifications](/images/optimal-rails-testing-toolset/terminal-guard-notifier.png?1408424600)

Other tools we love and use that you should look at
---------------------------------------------------

Some of those will be covered in future [Deployment
Academy](/categories/deployment-academy) posts, but you can look at them
in the meantime:

-   [shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers):
    Collection of testing matchers.
-   [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr): This is great if your tool is
    hitting some external API. It records your test suite’s HTTP
    interactions and replay them during future test runs for fast,
    deterministic, accurate tests.
-   [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/): Jasmine is a behavior-driven
    development framework for testing JavaScript code. Its syntax looks
    a bit like RSpec, especially if you use CoffeeScript.
-   [guard-jasmine](https://github.com/guard/guard-jasmine): This a lot
    like guard-rspec, this will run your Jasmine specs on save.

Conclusion
----------

Ruby and Rails' ecosystems are very rich in testing tools, and after
much iteration these are the ones we love and cherish. What tools are
you using that you like a lot?
