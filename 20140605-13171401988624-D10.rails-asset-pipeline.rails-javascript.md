Doing like a module with Rails asset-pipeline and CoffeeScript

Some days ago, I played around with requirejs. Although I liked to group
my client side code into AMD modules, using the (only) appropriate gem
‘requirejs-rails’ doesn’t felt that good. Main reasons for that

-   last commit some months ago
-   no Rails 4 support so far
-   asset precompilation failed with my concrete project

To be fair, that asset:precompile issues with requirejs-rails were
caused by some third-party Gems I used. But anyway, they compiled under
stock Rails and they failed when using requirejs-rails. So it seems that
sprockets integration isn’t that flawless with requirejs-rails.

So I thought about how to get some module-like-feeling, with just the
tools, Rails delivers out of the box. Let’s approach.

Assumptions
-----------

Let’s assume the following class hierarchy

      Component
      SeatPlan < Component
      SeatPlan.InputDataSanitizer
      (SeatPlan.Ui)

SeatPlan should be a subclass of Component. Also I wanted
InputDataSanitzer to be a class on its own, but located “below”
SeatPlan, because it only sanitizes SeatPlan input data. Think of some
kind of namespacing. Same for Ui. The only difference between these two
is, that SeatPlan should store a reference to DataInputSanitizer, where
as for Ui it should only store a concrete instance.

AMD/requirejs
-------------

With AMD, I would write something like this

Imitate AMD with sprockets
--------------------------

Without something like AMD, you have to put these classes somewhere in
global scope in order to access them from within your client-side code.
Let’s put them below window.app

      window
      + app
        + Component
        + SeatPlan
          + InputDataSanitizer
          + Ui

Combining Rails asset-pipeline directives and some CoffeeScript we can
imitate something like a module system. Let’s look at the code.

Thanks to CoffeeScripts ‘do’, which allows us to explicitly create a
closure, it feels almost like doing AMD. Just without the need for any
additional Gem/module loader.
