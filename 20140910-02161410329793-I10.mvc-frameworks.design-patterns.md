Passive View
============

A screen and components with all application specific behavior extracted
into a controller so that the widgets have their state controlled
entirely by controller.

This is part of the [Further Enterprise Application Architecture
development](/eaaDev) writing that I was doing in the mid 2000’s. Sadly
too many other things have claimed my attention since, so I haven’t had
time to work on them further, nor do I see much time in the foreseeable
future. As such this material is very much in draft form and I won’t be
doing any corrections or updates until I’m able to find time to work on
it again.

A perennial problem with building rich client systems is the
complication of testing them. Most rich client frameworks were not built
with automated testing in mind. Controlling these frameworks
programaticly is often very difficult.

A Passive View handles this by reducing the behavior of the UI
components to the absolute minimum by using a controller that not just
handles responses to user events, but also does all the updating of the
view. This allows testing to be focused on the controller with little
risk of problems in the view.

How it Works
------------

This pattern is yet another variation on model-view-controller and
model-view-presenter. As with these the UI is split between a view that
handles display and a controller that responds to user gestures. The
significant change with Passive View is that the view is made completely
passive and is no longer responsible for updating itself from the model.
As a result all of the view logic is in the controller. As a result,
there is no dependencies in either direction between the view and the
model.

Figure 1: Unlike most MVC-style configurations, Passive View results in
no dependencies between view and model.

Looking at our regular assessment window example, again we see a
view/controller split, but this time the controller does all the work in
figuring out how the view should display the model. The text field
widget receives the user gesture but immediately hands off to the
controller, in the classic MVP movement. The controller then updates the
model, and then handles the reloading of the view from the model. This
load actions involves pulling all the data needed from the model, and
using it to update the widgets. This example shows a coarse-grained
synchronization, where any change results in a complete reload.

Figure 2: When the actual text is edited, all the UI response is handled
by the controller.

The primary driver for Passive View is testing, as a result it's often
valuable to use of [Test
Double](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Double.html) for the view so
that the controller can be tested without needing any interaction with
the UI framework. This needs a intermediate
[Gateway](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/gateway.html) to be setup
as in [Figure 4](#passiveScreen_asssesIntermed-cd.gif). This is the same
technique that you would use for [Supervising
Controller](SupervisingPresenter.html). As with [Supervising
Controller](SupervisingPresenter.html) I've shown a stub here, but this
is also a good opportunity to use a mock.

Figure 4: Setting up the view as a
[Gateway](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/gateway.html) so that it's
easy to substitute the window with a [Test
Double](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Double.html)

When to Use It
--------------

The driving reason to use Passive View is to enhance testability. With
the view reduced to a dumb slave of the controller, you run little risk
by not testing the view. The controller can run and be tested outside of
the UI environment - indeed if you use a [Test
Double](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Double.html) for the view you
don't need to even have the UI classes available to you.

Passive View isn't the only way make the view sufficiently humble to
help in testing. [Presentation Model](PresentationModel.html) and
[Supervising Controller](SupervisingPresenter.html) are both reasonable
alternatives. The strength that Passive View has over these two is that
both of the alternatives require the view to do some of the
synchronization work, which results in more untestable behavior than
Passive View. Whether this difference is significant or not is a
judgment call.

Another advantage that Passive View is a very explicit mechanism.
There's very little reliance on
[Observer](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201633612)
mechanisms or declarative mappings. This makes it much easier to read
the code to see what is happening - particularly useful if you're trying
to debug when things go wrong.
