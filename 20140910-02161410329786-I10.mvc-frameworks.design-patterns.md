Supervising Controller
======================

Factor the UI into a view and controller where the view handles simple
mapping to the underlying model and the the controller handles input
response and complex view logic.

This is part of the [Further Enterprise Application Architecture
development](/eaaDev) writing that I was doing in the mid 2000’s. Sadly
too many other things have claimed my attention since, so I haven’t had
time to work on them further, nor do I see much time in the foreseeable
future. As such this material is very much in draft form and I won’t be
doing any corrections or updates until I’m able to find time to work on
it again.

Many UI frameworks provide the ability to easily map between the view
and model, often using some kind of [Data Binding](DataBinding.html).
These approaches are very effective in allowing you to declaratively set
up a relationship between elements in the view and model. Usually,
however, there are more complex relationships which require you to have
more complex view logic. This logic can be hard to manage, and in
particular hard to test, while embedded in the view.

Supervising Controller uses a controller both to handle input response
but also to manipulate the view to handle more complex view logic. It
leaves simple view behavior to the declarative system, intervening only
when effects are needed that are beyond what can be achieved
declaratively.

How it Works
------------

Supervising Controller decomposes presentation functionality into two
parts: a controller (often called presenter) and view. The domain data
that needs to be displayed is separate, and following rough MVC
terminology I'll refer to it as a model, although it need not be a
[Domain Model](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html). The
basic division of responsibilities echoes the Model-View-Presenter
architecture in its Dolphin form, as described by [Bower and
McGlashan](http://www.object-arts.com/papers/TwistingTheTriad.PDF).

A Supervising Controller has two primary responsibilities: input
response and partial view/model synchronization.

For input response the controller operates in the presenter style. The
user gestures are handled initially by the screen widgets, however all
they do in response is to hand these events off to the presenter, which
handles all further logic.

For view/model synchronization the controller defers as much of this as
reasonable to the view. The view typically uses some form of [Data
Binding](DataBinding.html) to populate much of the information for its
fields. Where [Data Binding](DataBinding.html) isn't up to more complex
interactions then the controller steps in.

Figure 2: Sequence diagram showing the response for putting in a low
actual value.

In the assessment window, the initial text change is handled by the text
field widget in the view. This widget is observed by the controller, so
when the text changes the widgets emits an event which results in the
controller's `actualFieldChanged` method being called. This method then
handles the full response to the event. It first updates the reading
model object's actual value. The window observes the reading object so
the change to the reading's value triggers a refresh. It's pretty easy
to map the actual and variance text fields' text to the appropriate
properties of the reading, so that updates those values. For the
purposes of our example changing the color is a bit more involved. The
reading object can, and should, determine which category the reading
should fit into. A sophisticated widget might be able to bind its text
color to a category like this, but we'll assume we don't have such a
clever young thing. In this case controller takes over setting the
variance field's text color directly.

As the example shows, the essence of a good Supervising Controller is to
do as little as possible. Let the view handle as much as possible and
only step in when there's more complex logic involved.

One of the prime reasons to use Supervising Controller is for
testability. Assuming the view is hard to test, by moving any complex
logic into the controller, we put the logic in a place that's easier to
test. In order to run tests on the controller, however, we do need some
form of view, so a [Test
Double](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Double.html) is often in order.
With the double in place, we don't have any need for UI framework
objects in order to test the more awkward parts of the UI behavior.

This testability issue affects another decision - whether the controller
should access the view and its widgets directly, or through an
intermediary. With an intermediary we build a
[Gateway](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/gateway.html) for the the
controller. The gateway defines an interface for the controller to
manipulate. One implementation then adapts the window's interface while
the other provides a stub for testing (you could also use a mock). This
is the same approach that you need for [Passive
View](PassiveScreen.html).

The discussion so far suggests using [Flow
Synchronization](FlowSynchronization.html) with Supervising Controller,
but this need not be the case. It is possible to use [Observer
Synchronization](MediatedSynchronization.html), but it needs to be
modified so that it's the controllers that observe the model rather than
the views.

When to Use It
--------------

There are two main reasons to look into using a Supervising Controller:
to separate out the complexity of an [Autonomous
View](AutonomousView.html), and to improve testability.

The separation advantage is that it pulls all the behavioral complexity
away from the basic window itself, making it easier to understand. This
advantage is offset by the fact that the controller is still closely
coupled to its screen, needing a pretty intimate knowledge of the
details of the screen. In which case there is a real question mark over
whether it's worth the effort of making it a separate object.

The testability reason is the more compelling one. Many people I've
talked to have found using some form of controller has made a big
difference to making a UI that is properly testable.

If testability is your driver then the driving issue is how much
behavior to leave in the view. [Passive View](PassiveScreen.html) is a
very similar pattern to Supervising Controller, but with the difference
that [Passive View](PassiveScreen.html) puts all the view update
behavior in the controller, including simple cases. This results in
extra programming, but does mean that all the presentation behavior is
testable. The choice between the two depends on what kind of [Data
Binding](DataBinding.html) support you have and whether you're happy to
leave that untested by controller tests.

A third alternative is [Presentation Model](PresentationModel.html).
This again pulls most behavior away from the view, but leaves it to the
view to synchronize all its updates. There isn't a great deal of the
difference in test coverage between [Presentation
Model](PresentationModel.html) and Supervising Controller - much of the
choice (as with [Passive View](PassiveScreen.html)) depends on personal
judgments.
