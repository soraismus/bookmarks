**Participatory economics**, often abbreviated **parecon**, is an
[economic system](/wiki/Economic_system "Economic system") based on
[participatory decision
making](/wiki/Participation_(decision_making) "Participation (decision making)")
as the primary [economic mechanism](/wiki/Economics "Economics") for the
allocation of the [factors of
production](/wiki/Factors_of_production "Factors of production") and
guidance of production in a given society. Participatory decision-making
involves the participation of all persons in decision-making on issues
in proportion to the impact such decisions have on their lives.
Participatory economics is a form of [decentralized economic
planning](/wiki/Decentralized_planning_(economics) "Decentralized planning (economics)")
and [socialism](/wiki/Socialism "Socialism") involving the [common
ownership](/wiki/Common_ownership "Common ownership") of the means of
production. The participatory economic system is proposed as an
alternative to contemporary [capitalism](/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism"),
as well as an alternative to [central
planning](/wiki/Planned_economy "Planned economy"). This economic model
is primarily associated with the proposals put forth by the political
theorist [Michael Albert](/wiki/Michael_Albert "Michael Albert") and
economist [Robin Hahnel](/wiki/Robin_Hahnel "Robin Hahnel"), who
describe participatory economics as an
[anarchistic](/wiki/Anarchism "Anarchism") economic
vision.^[[1]](#cite_note-1)^

The underlying values that parecon seeks to implement are
[equity](/wiki/Equity_(economics) "Equity (economics)"),
[solidarity](/wiki/Social_solidarity "Social solidarity"), diversity,
[workers'
self-management](/wiki/Workers%27_self-management "Workers' self-management")
and efficiency (defined as accomplishing goals without wasting valued
assets). The institutions of parecon include
[workers'](/wiki/Workers%27_council "Workers' council") and consumers'
councils utilizing self-managerial methods for making decisions,
[balanced job
complexes](/wiki/Balanced_job_complex "Balanced job complex"),
[remuneration](/wiki/Remuneration "Remuneration") based on individual
effort, and [participatory
planning](/wiki/Parecon#Participatory_Planning "Parecon").

Albert and Hahnel stress that parecon is only meant to address an
alternative economic theory and must be accompanied by equally important
alternative visions in the fields of
[politics](/wiki/Politics "Politics"),
[culture](/wiki/Culture "Culture") and
[kinship](/wiki/Kinship "Kinship"). The authors have also discussed
elements of [anarchism](/wiki/Anarchism "Anarchism") in the field of
politics, [polyculturalism](/wiki/Polyculturalism "Polyculturalism") in
the field of culture, and [feminism](/wiki/Feminism "Feminism") in the
field of family and gender relations as being possible foundations for
future alternative visions in these other spheres of society. [Stephen
R. Shalom](/wiki/Stephen_R._Shalom "Stephen R. Shalom") has begun work
on a participatory political vision he calls "[par
polity](/wiki/Participatory_politics "Participatory politics")". Both
systems together make up the political philosophy of
[Participism](/wiki/Participism "Participism"). Participatory Economics
has also significantly shaped the interim [International Organization
for a Participatory
Society](/wiki/International_Organization_for_a_Participatory_Society "International Organization for a Participatory Society").

Decision-making principle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Participatory_economics&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Decision-making principle")]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the primary propositions of parecon is that all persons should
have a say in decisions proportionate to the degree to which they are
affected by them. This decision-making principle is often referred to as
*self-management*. In parecon, it constitutes a replacement for the
mainstream economic conception of [economic
freedom](/wiki/Economic_freedom "Economic freedom"), which Albert and
Hahnel argue that by its very vagueness has allowed it to be abused by
[capitalist](/wiki/Capitalist "Capitalist") ideologues.

### Balanced job complexes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Participatory_economics&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Balanced job complexes")]

Some tasks and jobs are more desirable than others, and some tasks and
jobs are more menial than others. So, to achieve an equitable [division
of labour](/wiki/Division_of_labour "Division of labour"), it is
proposed that each individual do different tasks, which, taken together,
bring an average desirability and an average level of empowerment. The
main goals are to dissolve economic hierarchy and achieve one class of
workers, and to empower all to make contributions to the workplace.
Hahnel and Albert argue that without balanced job complexes, those with
empowering jobs, such as accounting or management, would be able to
formulate plans and ideas, while others, such as janitors, would not
develop the capacity to do so and neither would they have the training.
Without balanced job complexes, most workers would most likely end up
merely ratifying the proposals of empowered workers, and would have

Albert and Hahnel argue that it is inequitable and ineffective to
compensate people on the basis of their birth or heredity. Therefore,
the primary principle of participatory economics is to reward for effort
and sacrifice.^[[3]](#cite_note-Albert.2C_Michael_Parecon_p._112-117-3)^
For example, [mining](/wiki/Mining "Mining") work — which is
[dangerous](/wiki/Safety "Safety") and uncomfortable — would be more
highly paid than [office](/wiki/Office "Office") work for the same
amount of time, thus allowing the miner to work fewer hours for the same
pay, and the burden of highly dangerous and strenuous jobs to be shared
among the populace.

Additionally, participatory economics would provide exemptions from the
compensation for effort
principle.^[[3]](#cite_note-Albert.2C_Michael_Parecon_p._112-117-3)^
People with [disabilities](/wiki/Disability "Disability") who are unable
to work, [children](/wiki/Child "Child"), the
[elderly](/wiki/Elderly "Elderly"), the infirm and workers who are
legitimately in transitional circumstances, can be remunerated according
to need. However, every *able* adult has the obligation to perform some
socially useful work as a requirement for receiving reward, albeit in
the context of a society providing free [health
care](/wiki/Health_care "Health care"),
[education](/wiki/Education "Education"), skills training, and the
freedom to choose between various democratically structured workplaces
with jobs balanced for desirability and empowerment.

The starting point for the income of all workers in participatory
economics is an equal share of the social product. From this point,
incomes for personal [expenditures](/wiki/Expenditure "Expenditure") and
consumption rights for public goods can be expected to diverge by small
degrees reflecting the choices that individual workers make in striking
a balance between work and [leisure](/wiki/Leisure "Leisure") time, and
reflecting the level of danger and strenuousness of a job as assigned by
their immediate
peers.^[[3]](#cite_note-Albert.2C_Michael_Parecon_p._112-117-3)^

### Facilitation Boards[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Participatory_economics&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Facilitation Boards")]

In a proposed Participatory Economy, key information relevant to
converging on an economic plan would be made available by [Iteration
Facilitation
Boards](/wiki/Facilitation_board_(economics) "Facilitation board (economics)")
(IFBs), which, based on proposals from worker/consumer councils and
economic data, present indicative prices and economic projections at
each round of the planning process.

The IFB has no decision-making authority. In theory, the IFB's activity
can consist mainly of computers performing the (agreed upon) algorithms
for adjusting prices and forecasts, with little human
involvement.^[[4]](#cite_note-4)^

At later stages of the planning process, the IFBs could present a number
of annual plans consistent with the participatory planning results, to
be chosen by a popular vote.

The facilitation boards should function according to a maximum level of
[radical
transparency](/wiki/Radical_transparency "Radical transparency") and
only have very limited powers of mediation, subject to the discretion of
the participating councils. The real decisions regarding the formulation
and implementation of the plan are to be made in the consumers' and
producers' councils.

### Money in a participatory economy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Participatory_economics&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Money in a participatory economy")]

Main article: [Labour voucher](/wiki/Labour_voucher "Labour voucher")

Pareconomists propose replacing conventional money with a [personal
voucher](/wiki/Labour_voucher "Labour voucher") system which would be
non-transferable between consumers, and would be only usable at a store
to purchase
goods.^[*[citation\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^

The proposed electronic "credits" awarded to workers based on their
perceived level of effort and sacrifice would simply be deducted from
the workers account when used to make a purchase, disappearing rather
than transferring the credit to the vendor. People would be able to
borrow credits if approved by an appropriate board, but no interest
would be charged.

Albert and Hahnel claim the non-transferability of parecon credits would
make it impossible to bribe or even beg for
money^[*[citation\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^
and monetary theft would be impossible. People would still be free to
barter their individual goods with each other, e.g. exchange a couch for
a stereo, but any attempt to create an exchangeable currency would
likely be discouraged, as this might lead to attempts to reinstate money
and capitalism. Credits might be shareable amongst family members,
depending on how the parecon is set up.

Albert and Hahnel did not clarify how a currency of this form would be
used in international trading with non-parecon countries. If a
capitalist country refuses to be paid for their bought goods in this
way, it is likely that a parecon nation would use money for
international trading, but keep its unique credit currency for internal
purposes.

Opposition to central planning and capitalism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Participatory_economics&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Opposition to central planning and capitalism")]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See also: [Libertarian
socialism](/wiki/Libertarian_socialism "Libertarian socialism")

[Robin Hahnel](/wiki/Robin_Hahnel "Robin Hahnel") has argued that
"participatory planning is not central planning", stating "The
procedures are completely different and the incentives are completely
different. And one of the important ways in which it is different from
central planning is that it is incentive compatible, that is, actors
have an incentive to report truthfully rather than an incentive to
misrepresent their capabilities or preferences."^[[5]](#cite_note-5)^
Unlike historical examples of central planning, the parecon proposal
advocates the use and adjustment of price information reflecting
marginal social opportunity costs and benefits as integral elements of
the planning process. Hahnel has argued emphatically against Milton
Friedman's [a
priori](/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori_(philosophy) "A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)")
tendency to deny the possibility of alternatives:

> Friedman assumes away the best solution for coordinating economic
> activities. He simply asserts "there are only two ways of coordinating
> the economic activities of millions — central direction involving the
> use of [coercion](/wiki/Coercion "Coercion") — and voluntary
> cooperation, the technique of the marketplace." [...] a participatory
> economy can permit all to partake in economic decision making in
> proportion to the degree they are affected by outcomes. Since a
> participatory system uses a system of participatory planning instead
> of markets to coordinate economic activities, Friedman would have us
> believe that participatory planning must fall into the category of
> "central direction involving the use of
> coercion."^[[6]](#cite_note-6)^

Albert and Hahnel have voiced detailed critiques of centrally-planned
economies in theory and practice, but are also highly-critical of
capitalism. Hahnel claims "the truth is capitalism aggravates prejudice,
is the most inequitable economy ever devised, is grossly inefficient —
even if highly energetic — and is incompatible with both economic and
political democracy. In the present era of free-market triumphalism it
is useful to organize a sober evaluation of capitalism responding to
Friedman's claims one by one."^[[7]](#cite_note-7)^

### Critique of markets[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Participatory_economics&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Critique of markets")]

A primary reason why advocates of participatory economics perceive
markets to be unjust and inefficient is that only the interests of buyer
and seller are considered in a typical market transaction, while others
who are affected by the transaction have no voice in
it.^[*[citation\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^
For example when vehicles using [fossil
fuels](/wiki/Fossil_fuel "Fossil fuel") are manufactured, distributed
and sold, others outside the transaction end up bearing costs in the
form of pollution and resource depletion. The market price of vehicles
and fuel does not include these additional costs, which are referred to
as *[externalities](/wiki/Externality "Externality")*, resulting in
prices which will not accurately reflect aggregate opportunity
costs.^[*[citation\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^

Mainstream economists largely acknowledge the problem of externalities
but believe they can be addressed either through [Coasian
bargaining](/wiki/Coase_theorem "Coase theorem") or the use of [Pigovian
taxes](/wiki/Pigovian_tax "Pigovian tax") - extra taxes on goods that
have
externalities.^[*[citation\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^
According to economic theory, if Pigovian taxes are set so that the
after-tax cost of the good is equal to the social cost of the good, the
direct cost of production plus cost of externalities, then quantities
produced will tend toward a socially optimal level. Hahnel observes,
"more and more economists outside the mainstream are challenging this
assumption, and a growing number of skeptics now dare to suggest that
externalities are prevalent, and often substantial". Or, as E.K. Hunt
put it: externalities are the rule rather than the exception, and
therefore markets often work as if they were guided by a "malevolent
invisible foot" that keeps kicking us to produce more of some things,
and less of others than is socially efficient."^[[8]](#cite_note-8)^

As long as a market economy is in place, Albert and Hahnel favour
Pigovian taxes over other solutions to environmental problems such as
[command and control](/wiki/Command_economy "Command economy"), or the
issuance of marketable permits. However, Hahnel, who teaches ecological
economics at American University, argues that in a market economy
businesses try to avoid the "polluter pays principle" by shifting the
burden of the costs for their polluting activities to consumers. In
terms of incentives he argues this might be considered a positive
development because it would penalize consumers for "dirty" consumption.
However it also has regressive implications since [tax
incidence](/wiki/Tax_incidence "Tax incidence") studies show that
ultimately it would be poor people who would bear a great deal of the
burden of many pollution taxes. "In other words, many pollution taxes
would be highly regressive and therefore aggravate economic
injustice.".^[[9]](#cite_note-9)^ He therefore recommends that pollution
taxes be linked to cuts in regressive taxes such as social security
taxes.

Hahnel argues that Pigovian taxes, along with associated corrective
measures advanced by market economists, ultimately fall far short of
adequately or fairly addressing externalities. He argues such methods
are incapable of attaining accurate assessments of social costs:

> "Markets corrected by pollution taxes only lead to the efficient
> amount of pollution and satisfy the polluter pays principle if the
> taxes are set equal to the magnitude of the damage victims suffer. But
> because markets are not incentive compatible for polluters and
> pollution victims, markets provide no reliable way to estimate the
> magnitudes of efficient taxes for pollutants. Ambiguity over who has
> the property right, polluters or pollution victims, [free rider
> problems](/wiki/Free_rider_problem "Free rider problem") among
> multiple victims, and the transaction costs of forming and maintaining
> an effective coalition of pollution victims, each of whom is affected
> to a small but unequal degree, all combine to render market systems
> incapable of eliciting accurate information from pollution victims
> about the damages they suffer, or acting upon that information even if
> it were known.^[[10]](#cite_note-10)^

### Critique of tendency towards efficiency[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Participatory_economics&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Critique of tendency towards efficiency")]

Hahnel has also written a detailed discussion of parecon's desirability
compared to capitalism with respect to incentives to
innovate.^[[11]](#cite_note-11)^ In capitalism, [patent
laws](/wiki/Patent_law "Patent law"), [intellectual property
rights](/wiki/Intellectual_property_rights "Intellectual property rights"),
[industry
structures](/w/index.php?title=Industry_structure&action=edit&redlink=1 "Industry structure (page does not exist)"),
and [barriers to market
entry](/wiki/Barriers_to_market_entry "Barriers to market entry") are
institutional features that reward individual innovators while limiting
the use of new technologies. Hahnel notes that, in contrast, "in a
participatory economy all innovations will immediately be made available
to all enterprises, so there will never be any loss of static
efficiency.".^[[12]](#cite_note-12)^ Innovation is sometimes the outcome
of cumulative creativity, which pareconomists believe may not be
legitimately attributed to individuals.

Participatory economics and socialism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Participatory_economics&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Participatory economics and socialism")]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although participatory economics is not in itself intended to provide a
general political system, clearly its practical implementation would
depend on an accompanying political system. Advocates of parecon say the
intention is that the four main ingredients of parecon be implemented
with a minimum of [hierarchy](/wiki/Hierarchy "Hierarchy") and a maximum
of transparency in all discussions and decision making. This model is
designed to eliminate secrecy in economic decision making, and instead
encourage friendly cooperation and mutual support. This avoidance of
power hierarchies puts parecon in the
[anarchist](/wiki/Anarchism "Anarchism") political tradition. [Stephen
Shalom](/wiki/Stephen_Shalom "Stephen Shalom") has produced a political
system meant to complement parecon, called
[Parpolity](/wiki/Parpolity "Parpolity").

Although parecon falls under [left-wing](/wiki/Left-wing "Left-wing")
political tradition, it is designed to avoid the creation of powerful
intellectual elites or the rule of a bureaucracy, which is perceived as
the major problem of the economies of the [communist
states](/wiki/Communist_state "Communist state") of the 20th century.
Parecon advocates recognize that monopolization of empowering labor, in
addition to private ownership, can be a source of class division. Thus,
a three-class view of the economy (capitalists, coordinators, and
workers) is stressed, in contrast to the traditional two-class view of
Marxism. The coordinator class, emphasized in Parecon, refers to those
who have a monopoly on empowering skills and knowledge, and corresponds
to the doctors, lawyers, managers, engineers, and other professionals in
present economies. Parecon advocates argue that, historically, Marxism
ignored the ability of coordinators to become a new ruling class in a
post-capitalist society.^[[13]](#cite_note-13)^

The archetypal [workplace
democracy](/wiki/Workplace_democracy "Workplace democracy") model, the
[Wobbly Shop](/wiki/Wobbly_Shop "Wobbly Shop") was pioneered by the
[Industrial Workers of the
World](/wiki/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World "Industrial Workers of the World"),
in which the self-managing norms of [grassroots
democracy](/wiki/Grassroots_democracy "Grassroots democracy") were
applied.^[*[citation\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^

While many types of production and consumption may become more localised
under participatory economics, the model does not exclude [economies of
scale](/wiki/Economies_of_scale "Economies of scale").^[*[citation\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^

Criticisms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Participatory_economics&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Criticisms")]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[David Schweickart](/wiki/David_Schweickart "David Schweickart")
suggests Participatory Economics would be undesirable even if it was
possible, accusing it of being:

"a system obsessed with comparison (Is your job complex more empowering
than mine?), with monitoring (You are not working at average intensity,
mate--get with the program), with the details of consumption (How many
rolls of toilet paper will I need next year? Why are some of my
neighbors still using the kind not made of recycled
paper?"^[[14]](#cite_note-Schweickart-14)^

### Planning[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Participatory_economics&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Planning")]

Further information: [Economic calculation
problem](/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem "Economic calculation problem")

Participatory Economics would create a large amount of administrative
work for individual workers, who would have to plan their consumption in
advance, and a new bureaucratic class. Proponents of parecon argue that
capitalist economies are hardly free of bureaucracy or meetings, and a
parecon would eliminate banks, advertising, stock market, tax returns
and long-term financial planning. Albert and Hahnel claim that is
probable that a similar number of workers will be involved in a parecon
bureaucracy as in a capitalist bureaucracy,^[[15]](#cite_note-15)^ with
much of the voting achieved by computer rather than meeting, and those
who are not interested in the collective consumption proposals not
required to attend.^[[16]](#cite_note-zcommunications.org-16)^

Critics suggest that proposals require consideration of an unfeasibly
large set of policy choices,^[[14]](#cite_note-Schweickart-14)^ and that
lessons from planned societies show that peoples' daily needs cannot be
established well in advance simply by asking people what they
want.^[[17]](#cite_note-Fotopoulos-17)^ Albert and Hahnel note that
markets themselves hardly adjust prices
instantaneously,^[[18]](#cite_note-18)^ and suggest that in a
Participatory Economy [Facilitation
boards](/wiki/Facilitation_board_(economics) "Facilitation board (economics)")
could modify prices on a regular basis. According to Hahnel these act
according to democratically decided guidelines, can be composed of
members from other regions and are impossible to bribe due to parecon's
non-transferable currency.^[[19]](#cite_note-Robin_Hahnel_p._92-93-19)^
However, [Takis Fotopoulos](/wiki/Takis_Fotopoulos "Takis Fotopoulos")
argues that "no kind of economic organisation based on planning alone,
however democratic and decentralised it is, can secure real
self-management and freedom of
choice."^[[17]](#cite_note-Fotopoulos-17)^

### Loss of efficiency[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Participatory_economics&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Loss of efficiency")]

Parecon might reduce efficiency in the workplace. For one, expert and
exceptional workers (e.g. exceptional surgeons and scientists) would not
be performing their tasks full-time. Participatory economics would
expect them to share in "disempowering work" and would not offer
opportunities to seek additional compensation for their high ability or
finding solutions to problems.

Theodore Burczak argues that it is impossible for workers to give the
unbiased assessments of the "largely unobservable" characteristics of
**effort** proposed as the basis for salary levels, and the absence of
market *exchange* mechanisms likewise makes calculating social costs of
production and consumption impossible.^[[20]](#cite_note-20)^
