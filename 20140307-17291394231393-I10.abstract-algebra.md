I haven't the slightest idea why (inner or outer) semi-direct group
products are an interesting construction. I understand inner direct
products, because you're just giving conditions for which a group can be
considered the direct product of two of its subgroups, and I "get"
direct products. They're a very simple construction, and showing that a
group decomposes into that structure is a very strong statement.

But the outer semi-direct product construction seems totally arbitrary
and bizarre. What's the intuition, here?

A very important question in group theory is the extension problem:
given groups $H,N$, can you classify the groups $G$ that have $N$ as a
normal subgroup with quotient $H$? In other words, groups that fit in a
exact sequence $1 \\to N \\to G \\to H \\to 1$. Motivation from that
comes from the classification of finite simple groups and the existence
of composition series: if we could do all of that, and given these two
other tools, we could classify all finite groups. That's very
interesting!

As it turns out, the extension problem is very hard in general. The
direct product $H \\times N$ gives a "trivial" example of an extension
of $H$ by $N$, but there's not a lot that can be said -- that's only one
possible structure, there are many others.

There is one simplification though: split extensions. These are
extensions such that there exists a section of the projection $p : G
\\to H$ (that is, a morphism $s : H \\to G$ such that $ps = id$). This
class of extension is exactly the class of semidirect products $N
\\rtimes H$. So semidirect products give a partial answer to the
question of classifying group extensions.

* * * * *

I would also argue that the construction is not that far-fetched. I feel
like the dihedral group is a great example. It's the set of isometries
of a regular $n$-polygon. You've got rotations ($\\mathbb{Z/nZ}$) and a
symmetry with respect to a given line. Any element can be written as a
product of a rotation and either the identity or the symmetry. But when
you multiply two such elements, there's an interaction between the
rotation and the symmetry and the rotation (it gets changed to the
opposite rotation). If you think about it, it means that the dihedral
group can be represented as a semidirect product $\\mathbb{Z/nZ}
\\rtimes \\mathbb{Z/2Z}$. So another possible answer is that the
semidirect product is useful to construct interesting groups, for
example the dihedral group.

So a split extension is one in which the quotient group $H$ has a set of
"representatives" ($s(H)$ in your notation) which form a subgroup
isomorphic to it? – [Jack M](/users/30481/jack-m "3090 reputation") Feb

Yes, that's pretty much it. If you follow the steps of the proof you'll
see that then, $G$ is the (inner) semidirect product $i(N) \\rtimes
s(H)$ (where $i : N \\to G$ is the injection). –

Does it follow that every element of $G$ can be uniquely represented as
a product of one of those representatives and an element of $N$? – [Jack

Direct products for matrix groups are pretty easy to understand:
$$G\\times H = \\left\\{ \\begin{bmatrix} g & 0 \\\\ 0 & h
\\end{bmatrix} : g \\in G, h \\in H \\right\\}$$ They are just diagonal
matrices. Multiplying elements of $G\\times H$ can be done by looking at
the $G$ and the $H$ parts separately. They have basically nothing to do
with each other.

Sometimes though a group acts on something. For matrix groups, they tend
to act on vector spaces. If $G$ is a matrix group and $V$ is a vector
space for it (so that $V$ is a vector space of column vectors, and $gv
\\in V$ whenever $v \\in V$) then we can form something similar to the
direct product with upper triangular matrices: $$G\\ltimes V = \\left\\{
\\begin{bmatrix} g & v \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} : g \\in G, v \\in V
\\right\\}$$

In this group the $G$ part can be done ignoring the $V$ part:
$$\\begin{bmatrix} g & v \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} h &
w \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} gh & gw+v \\\\ 0 &
1\\end{bmatrix}$$ but the $V$ part (the $w$) is altered by the way the
$G$ part (the $g$) acts on $V$.

This sort of factorization happens automatically in some nice cases. For
instance if $X$ is a finite group whose Sylow 2-subgroup $G$ is cyclic,
or isomorphic to $C\_4 \\times C\_2$, or many other common things, then
$X$ automatically has such a $V$ (though it need not be a vector space,
but the formulas for multiplication still work).

Also if a finite group has exactly one Sylow $p$-subgroup $V$, then $X$
has a $G$. Again $V$ need not be a vector space so $G$ need not be a
matrix group, but the formulas still hold.

One important idea of a semidirect product $H \\ltimes N$ is the group
action of $H$ on $N$. The outer semidirect product just shows that any
group action of $H$ on $N$ (from another point of view, any homomorphism
$H \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}(N)$) determines a group, in the
"obvious way".

So if you want to study groups $G = HN$, where $N$ is normal in $G$ and
$H \\cap N = 1$, the construction of external semidirect products gives
you all possible such groups (and you might want to study these, since
there are many important examples of semidirect products, and they are
common).

The definition of the operation in external semidirect product is very
natural, in $G$ above we have

$$(h'n')(hn) = (h'h)((h\^{-1}n'h)n)$$

and now here $n \\mapsto h\^{-1}nh$ is the group action. So given $H$,
$N$ and a group action $\\phi: H \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}(N)$
(with $h \\mapsto \\phi\_h$), to make the set of pairs $(h,n)$ into a
semidirect product, we should define

$$(h',n') \\cdot (h,n) = (h'h, \\phi\_h(n')n)$$

and this turns out to work.

Perhaps that is badly phrased. But if you read further, I'm trying to
explain why the definition is a bit obvious, and not arbitrary and
bizarre. – [spin](/users/12623/spin "3211 reputation") Feb 22 at 22:13
