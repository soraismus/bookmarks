I'm wondering how hard it would be to implement a **chess engine**. Are
there already open-source implementations?

It seems that you'd need a scoring function for a given board
constellation, and a very fast way of exploring several likely future
board constellations. Exploring all possible future moves is of course
impossible, so one could greedily follow the most promising moves, or
use approximate techniques like [simulated
annealing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated%5Fannealing) to follow
likely moves probabilistically.

Do you think that is within the scope of a [machine
learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine%5Flearning) graduate
student project -- assuming there was an open-source implementation that
the students could use, that does the basic things like returning the
next possible moves for a given figure? Probably too hard?

It would be a fun project to have different teams work on chess engines
and then let them play against each other ...

Thanks for all the answers. One more aspect is a chess database of
previous games. A big one is used on
[chessgames.com](http://www.chessgames.com), but is there one available
for free use? Also, ideally one would like to learn the opponent's way
of playing as the game proceeds, to better predict his or her next
moves. – [Frank](/users/60628/frank "16579 reputation") Jul 19 '09 at

I have spent the last year building my own chess engine in C\#. It was
not all that difficult. During my work I have made mistakes, I have
found that information on the internet was just not presented clearly,
and much of it was simply copied from other sites.

In order to make life easier for someone else going through this
process, I have been documenting the development of my chess engine and
posted much of the source code on my blog:

[http://www.chessbin.com](http://www.chessbin.com)

I have even created a [Chess Game Development
Kit](http://www.chessbin.com/page/Chess-Game-Starer-Kit.aspx) that will
get you started in developing your own chess engine, which contains:

1.  All the code necessary to represent a chess board and chess pieces
2.  Code related to valid chess piece movement
3.  Graphical User Interface that displays the chess position and allows
    you to move pieces around the board

My site is basically dedicated for people just like you; people that
want to get started on building their own chess engine.

I just wanted to note that rotated bitboards are no longer the prefered
way to go. Most programmers that were using rotated bitboard are now
using a technique called Magic Bitboards
([chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Magic+Bitboards](http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Magic+Bitboards)).

My new C\# chess engine uses magic bitboards. They're very fast, but
initially difficult to wrap your head around them (rotated bitboards are
even worse). –

[Crafty](http://www.craftychess.com/) is one of the top chess engines
and completely open source. However I would discourage you from using it
for a student project it's written in C, very complex and very hard to
understand because it is highly optimized.

For educational purposes I would recommend taking a look at [Adam
Berents site](http://www.chessbin.com/) where he describes the process
he went through when he implemented a chess engine in C\#. The source
code is available as well of course. It's an excellent point to start
from, in my opinion.

This is already done on [FICS](http://www.freechess.org/) chess server.
I suggest you to login there (needs telnet) and check the documentation
as well, you will probably be able to get in touch with people able to
give you specific hints on their chessbots

A reasonable chess engine on modern PCs is certainly doable, especially
if you're old enough to remember there were many Chess programs that
used just a few K of memory on 1 and 2 MHz 8-bit machines that could
play pretty well. You can whip out a chess engine in an interpreted
language nowadays and beat the pants off a top 6502 or Z80 programmer
coding his tightest fastest stuff.

I got to work with Dan Spracklen, who did the original
[Sargon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon%5F%28chess%29) in 1978 with
his wife Kathleen. Kathleen's brother did the port to Apple II, and I
worked with him and with his son. (At the time I worked with these guys,
the chess-for-consumer-profit business was done. I remember one guy who
brought out Atari ST and Amiga Chess games and there was really not much
market for them by that time.)

"[Computer
Gamesmanship](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0671495321)" is a
terrific introduction to chess programming as hobbyists performed it in
1983. It's still a delight to read. Covers the good stuff: alpha-beta,
minimax, etc.

It's a good enough book that you can start there and then learn about
the advances made since.

To make a good one is hard, but probably at about the right level for a
graduate project (when I took my batchelor's in Computer Science, a
friend of mine wrote a chess engine for his final year dissertation).

And yes there are Open Source ones, the leading contender being [GNU
Chess](http://www.gnu.org/software/chess/), which is very well
respected.

Every year at my university, the Introduction to AI course (3rd year
course) requires students to create a chess program from scratch along
with a paper, and we covered a chapter about adversarial search in
lecture so that students have enough knowledge to do it. For us, the
project can be done either on our own or with another (obviously
expecting a better program if done with a partner, such as deeper ply,
etc.). Because the Computer Graphics course is also a 3rd year course,
students are allowed to combine the final project of that with the final
project of the AI course.

Since I happen to be in my 3rd year and am taking both courses (which
have now ended with the first semester), I teamed up with a friend who's
also in both courses and we've been working on the program since the end
of our exams (which was around Dec. 21) and it's due on Jan. 11.

It's completely doable within a month (especially as a graduate
project). We're making a 3d chess program thus it requires more work
than just a chess engine of course. The hardest parts will be deciding
on a board representation, implementing all the rules (en passant,
castling, promotion, etc.), creating a heuristic function, and the game
tree (which is usually done with alpha-beta pruning).

Here is the site which we're using to document progress, and later host
the code and the paper once we're done (it's a bit empty right now).

You need to generate all the vaild moves for the given state. Then for
every possibility you should to check the opponents possible moves. If
there is at least one of them which makes your position worse then you
should not follow that branch. To do this you need some kind of scoring
to determine how well you are doing. Chess already have some rules about
which unit worth how much points. It is enough to look ahead only a few
steps like this. Beating the program will still be challenging.

This is of course far from perfect: real players can sacrifice some
units to achieve long term goals. This algorithm will not do that.

That's the alpha-beta algorithm, right? Your last comment is right on:
If the human opponent sacrifices a piece, to gain something long-term,
then he is doing a move that the computer didn't expect. That's probably
how the grandmasters beat good chess engines. –

I almost got it right. Now that I know it's name I found the actual
algorithm:
[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta\_pruning\#Pseudocode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning#Pseudocode)
It is not so quick to decide which branches are worthless. The algo in
my answer is less accurate but faster. –

We did a mancala AI followed by a chess AI in Algorithms and Data
Structures (sophomore CS).

However, the professor provided big chunks of the chess engine, and we
had to do things like improve the decision function, implement
checkmate, and other things.

In my undergrad AI course we spent half a semester creating various
chess engines and testing them out using XBoard or WinBoard. Then at the
end of the semester we had a tournament where the student's chess
engines competed with each other in XBoard. Overall it worked out pretty
well.

Interfacing to XBoard is fairly easy if I recall correctly. Here are
some links.

[http://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/](http://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/)

interface for XBoard

[http://www.tim-mann.org/xboard/engine-intf.html](http://www.tim-mann.org/xboard/engine-intf.html)

I'm not sure if this gets you everything you want, I think our chess
engines had to create their own board representations and come up with
moves on their own, but at least it gets you a graphical board that
knows the rules and has a GUI.

It depends on the strength level you are targeting and your programming
skills. Assuming you area an **experienced programmer**, here's my
opinion (i know lots of engines, but never coded one):

\*A very simple engine, that can beat an beginner/amateur(ELO
1200-1600): lots of code, but easy.

\*A engine, that can beat a 'club player' (ELO 1800-2000): it starts to
get hard, you'll need opening books, optimizations and a solid AI

\*A engine that can beat a master: hard, you'll need some years of
previous experience

\*A top engine (like Rybka, Houdini, Stockfish, Hiarcs), that can beat
any human being on earth 99% of time: this is a tremendous effort,
you'll need a LOT of patience and years of experience.

That's how i see it!

I like this answer because I'm considering doing it and am trying to see
a rough guideline for what kind of performance I should be aiming for.
I'm wondering how you came up with these estimates though? –
