*Today’s wealth gap does not just exist between the richest 1 percent of
the population and everyone else; there have been growing inequalities
among the less-wealthy 99 percent of people, too. In an article
published today in*Science*, MIT economist David Autor contends that
much of our present inequality stems from disparities in education. This
has evolved in two directions: From 1980 to 2012, inflation-adjusted,
full-time earnings of college-educated males increased anywhere from 20
percent to 56 percent, depending on whether they also acquired graduate
degrees. Conversely, real earnings of high school graduates fell 11
percent, and earnings of high school dropouts fell 22 percent.*MIT
News*talked with Autor about inequality.*

**Q.** You are focused on inequality among the so-called “99 percent,”
not between the 1 percent and the 99 percent. Why?

**A.** There’s a real national debate about the significance and causes
of inequality. This public debate is dominated by the discussion of the
top 1 percent. And the top 1 percent is important, but focusing on the
top 1 percent conveys the message that the game is all rigged, that if
you’re not in the elite stratum, there’s nothing to shoot for. And
that’s just not the case. The growth of skill differentials among the
other 99 percent is arguably even more consequential than the rise of
the 1 percent for the welfare of most citizens.

Here’s a concrete way to see it: The earnings gap between the median
college-educated two-income family and the median high school-educated
two-income family rose by $28,000 between 1979 and 2012. This [shift] —
which excludes the top 1 percent, since we’re focusing on medians — is
four times as large as the redistribution that has taken place from the
bottom 99 percent to the top 1 percent of households in the same period.

**Q.** What accounts for inequality among the 99 percent, then?

**A.** The single most important factor is the rising return on
postsecondary education. That explains a lot of the growth and variance,
and that is pretty well explained by supply and demand factors. There
was a sharp deceleration in production of newly minted college graduates
from about 1980 forward, and that led immediately to a growth in the
skill premium. After 2005 there’s been an acceleration in production of
college graduates, and you see the skill differential start to plateau.

If you had to give a person a single piece of economic advice, it would
not be: Act like Gatsby and try to get into the top 1 percent. It would
be: Go get a college education at a decent school.

Now, there are many other factors that are affecting the wage
distribution … de-unionization, the [inflation-adjusted] decline in
minimum wage, [the growth of] international trade, which has led to a
big decline in manufacturing, and technological change, which drives
demand for more-skilled workers. These things all interact.

**Q.** In the *Science*article, you write that, “Confronting the cost of
college should not obscure the fact that the real lifetime earnings
premium to college education has likely never been higher.” What has
that premium looked like in the past?

**A.** We have data going back to 1915 on the skill premium. … It was
high on the eve of the second World War, declined very rapidly during
the war, [then] was stable through the 1960s, and came down through the
1970s, partly due to an influx of college graduates [receiving draft
deferments] because of the Vietnam War. Then there was this grand
acceleration, and it rose more or less continuously, for three decades,
and plateaued over the last several years.

People say, “Ah, the college premium has stopped rising,” and that’s
true, but it has plateaued at an incredibly high level. The relative
wage differential between college and high school graduates is higher
than it’s ever been. Now, college has gotten more expensive, but
relative to the lifetime earnings differential, it’s still quite an
attractive investment proposition.

Recent estimates find that for men the lifetime present value [after
subtracting tuition costs] has risen from $213,000 to $590,000 between
1965 and 2010, and for women it’s risen from $129,000 to $370,000. So
it’s risen by a quarter-million dollars. … The type of counterproductive
myth I’m trying to puncture in this article is that it’s all about the 1
percent, if you go to college you’re wasting your money, if you’re not
the “Wolf of Wall Street,” the game is over. That’s just destructively
incorrect.

**Q.** You contend that inequality is not altogether bad. So how do we
assess if it has gone too far?

**A.** There’s a value to inequality in a market economy. Inequality
provides incentives. But you can have too much inequality, or too
little. The concern about inequality is where economic dynamism gives
way to dynasticism, and inequality becomes self-reinforcing: If you
don’t “choose the right parents,” you’re stuck in the bottom forever.
Now, we have metrics of that, and the evidence so far is that U.S.
economic mobility has not been high in a very long time, since the early
20th century, but has not declined, as far as we can tell. Another
metric is absolute well-being, in terms of earnings and labor force
participation, and I think there’s real concern there.

**Q.** What policies can combat inequality?

**A.** In the long run, the best policies we have involve investing in
our citizenry. … Higher education, and public education, is America’s
best idea. Our decision to send our entire public through high school
over the first 30 years of the 20th century was probably the single most
important factor in U.S. economic predominance for that century. Those
investments [include] preschool, good primary and secondary schools,
[and] adequate nutrition and health care.

In the short run, the Earned Income Tax Credit has been a successful
policy, but it’s primarily targeted at women with kids. Our biggest
problem has been declining labor force participation among men without
current dependents, so that could be expanded. We can actually afford to
raise the minimum wage. We can stop incarcerating so many people — that
would save us a bunch of money and improve people’s lives over the long
run. The Affordable Care Act may have benefits in terms of people’s
skills development, if giving people adequate access to health care when
they’re young affects their cognitive capacity.

    *Wall Street Journal*reporter**Irving Wladawsky-Berger examines
    Prof. David Autor’s research on income inequality. “Mr. Autor
    estimates that the difference in the yearly earnings between a
    college-educated two-income family and a high school-educated
    two-income family has risen by $28,000 between 1979 and 2012,” he
    writes.

    “Economist David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
    found that the median woman with a college degree earned about
    $23,000 more a year than a woman who terminated her education once
    she earned her high school diploma,” writes *Washington Post*
    reporter Joann Weiner.

    “According to a paper by Mr. Autor published Thursday in the journal
    Science, the true cost of a college degree is about *negative*
    $500,000,” David Leonhardt writes in a *New York Times* piece about
    David Autor’s research on inequality.

    In an article for *The Washington Post*, Jim Tankersley reports on a
    new *Science* article by Professor David Autor. In the article Autor
    contends that inequality, driven by varying levels of education, has
    risen dramatically among the 99 percent.

    *Wall Street Journal* reporter Brenda Cronin features David Autor’s
    new research on inequality. “Two ‘destructive’ points that Mr. Autor
    tries to skewer with his most recent work are the idea that
    prospects are dim for all but the financial elite—and the notion
    that too many students are giving rise to a “college bubble,” Cronin
    writes.
