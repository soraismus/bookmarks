Govtech Fund founder Ron Bouganim (Credit: The Govtech Fund)

The American technology innovation ecosystem is, in some ways, a
well-oiled machine. A smart person or a group of smart people come up
with an idea and then go get funding to turn it into a business. In the
best cases, they end up not only making a living but changing an
industry for the better.

Why has government seemed so resistant to that process?

One problem, says many of those deeply involved in the tech world's
fundraising swirl, is that the venture capitalists who might be able to
help trigger innovation in government tech have, historically, laughed
those opportunities right out of their conference rooms and cafes.
Venture capitalists are largely pack animals, and the pack has long
determined that governments are simply too unreliable customers to
warrant much attention. That's been especially true in recent years,
when the near-instant payoff of the next Instagram or Snapchat or Twitch
often has seemed just around the corner.

Ron Bouganim wants to break out of that pack. On Monday the seasoned
technology entrepreneur [is launching the Govtech
Fund](http://govtechfund.com/), with $23 million in initial investment.
The fund, says Bouganim, will put money into companies aimed at
upgrading "the technology infrastructure that runs the day-to-day of
government," from the federal government down to to the smallest of
towns. Those are thousands upon thousands of potential customers, and
Bouganim says -- and is likely right -- that his is the first fund aimed
at supporting the govtech startups that hope to tap those customers.

Bouganim says that he and his investors are looking to pour funds into
companies that demonstrated that they know how to work with government,
whether that's understanding how to slide under the procurement limits
that trigger mounds of paperwork or make use of cloud computing in a way
that works within government's often-strict security requirements.

The Govtech Fund, which Bouganim is launching with Tim O'Reilly, the
high-profile tech world publisher and visionary, has already backed four
companies -- most of them outside the obvious locales of Washington or
San Francisco. They are [MindMixer](http://www.mindmixer.com/), a Kansas
City-based Web platform that allows cities to have conversations among
themselves; [Seamless Docs](https://www.seamlessdocs.com/), a New York
City-based paperless-document company; [Amigo
Cloud](https://www.amigocloud.com/homepage/index.html), a San Francisco
digital mapping company; and the Deerfield, Fla.,
[SmartProcure](http://smartprocure.us/), an online marketplace for
governments to buy things and for companies eager to sell to them.

Bouganim explains in simple terms why a company like SmartProcure is so
attractive to him: "The U.S. government buys 10 eBays' worth of stuff
just to operate," from software to heavy-duty trucking equipment.

Bouganim got into the business of government tech as a volunteer with
Code for America, the San Francisco nonprofit that works with local
governments to improve their technological infrastructures. In 2012,
Bouganim and O'Reilly helped launch the Code for America Accelerator,
which picks out civic-tech projects in their early stages and supports
them with $25,000 on their way to becoming full-fledged companies.

Inspired by that experience, Bouganim says that he started making the
rounds on Sand Hill Road and other places where California's VC
community gathers. Sure, investors had been scared away by the idea that
working with government might be a tortuous slog, but Bouganim says that
he saw that behind that red tape lay a market that could be worth in the
neighborhood of $500 billion a year. Still, he says, "A lot of
traditional VCs were still thinking there's nothing here." That's a
"classic information asymmetry," says Bouganim. And it smelled to him a
lot like opportunity.

Nick Bowden is the chief executive of MindMixer, one of the Govtech
Fund's early companies. "I distinctly remember a conversation with a
well known VC during our Series A round (2.5 years ago)," [Bowden
recently
wrote](https://medium.com/@njbowden/why-we-raised-17mm-ce92a3df13c3),
"who said 'you must be crazy if you are trying to raise money for a tech
company that works with government.' What most people don't realize is
government spends nearly $74 billion on technology annually. As a point
of comparison, the video game market is a $15 billion annual market.
That lack of market insight, combined with the usual perceptions —
government is slow, the sales cycle is too long, government isn't
innovative — prevented both potential founders and investors from
entering the market."

Concluded Bowden, "That's starting to change."

Some recent high-profile government IT failings have done their part,
says Bouganim, pointing to HealthCare.gov's bungled debut and the
crumbling of the Federal Communication Commission's Web site under the
load of open Internet comments. His colleagues are starting to come
around, he says, and he's hoping that the launch of the Govtech Fund
will trigger competing funds in the government tech space.

He says he's also counting on a pair of cultural shifts to work in his
favor. Those responsible for buying tech from inside government are
changing, he says: More people in those positions are comfortable with
the idea that some of the best tech might be produced not simply by
big-name government contractors by small groupings of smart
private-sector technologists. Meanwhile, those technologist are starting
to look to the government arena as a place to do neat work.

"If you want to work on big, gnarly, complicated problems," says
Bouganim, "government is where you want to be."

Bouganim, a Canadian by birth who became a U.S. citizen in recent years,
says that he's motivated in part by the desire to help make sure that
that governments in his adopted country are using the best, most
appropriate technologies they can as they go about serving their
citizens. "And what better way to have an impact," he says, "than
capitalism?"
