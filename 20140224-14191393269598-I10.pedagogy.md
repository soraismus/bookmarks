Networks*.\
 \
 The Illusion of Understanding\
 For the past three decades I’ve been working to dispel myself of an
illusion that’s hard to recognize and even harder to overcome. I call it
the “Illusion of Understanding.” It’s the false belief that we
understand something but then we discover we actually don’t. The example
problem below will help clarify what I mean. Consider the following…\
 \
 Iceberg Challenge\
 \

[](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=6645583842972204443)[![Glass
of ice water with ice cubes floating in
it](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IPX5LnmzDAo/UwZiGjTUb-I/AAAAAAAAAGI/LSCXzexS8B4/s1600/IceCubeProblem.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IPX5LnmzDAo/UwZiGjTUb-I/AAAAAAAAAGI/LSCXzexS8B4/s1600/IceCubeProblem.png)

The glass of water in this picture is filled to the brim. One more drop,
and water would spill over the edge. When examining the ice you note
that the cubes rise just above the surface of the water (like glaciers
in the ocean), but do not extend to the bottom of the glass. Now here’s
the challenge: Imagine patiently waiting on a hot summer day until all
the ice melts. What will happen to the water level? Does it rise and
over-flow the glass, remain constant throughout the melting process, or
go down? \
 \
 Think about what’s going on for you as you wrestle with this challenge.
Do you feel like you know the right answer? How confident are you in
your response? Are you, like most people who face this challenge,
surprised to find that you aren’t sure of the answer, while also feeling
conflicted because you think you should know it? If you answered “Yes”
to this last question, then you just experienced the Illusion of
Understanding first-hand.\
 \
 This is a challenging problem for most people – physics students and
adults alike. Yet the problem is based on a principle called Archimedes
Principle that most of us encountered at some point in a physical
science class.\
 \
 As challenging as the problem is for students, consider how much more
daunting it is for a science teacher who wants to help students
understand the principle so well that even years later they can
confidently use that understanding to solve problems like this one. I
know how daunting the challenge is, because many years ago I was that
science teacher.\
 \
 Here’s the dilemma. As a teacher, I can assure you that it’s very, very
difficult to help students develop what I call “authentic understanding”
– the kind of understanding that would enable them to answer the iceberg
challenge correctly and explain why their answer is correct. It’s a
great deal easier (although not a conscious goal) for a teacher to leave
students with the illusion of understanding – the belief that they
understand the relevant principle even though they can’t answer
questions based on the principle. I have given the iceberg challenge to
hundreds of intelligent, educated adults over many years. Based on their
performance I’d say that – despite the best efforts of many capable,
dedicated science teachers – authentic understanding in this subject
area is relatively rare while the illusion of understanding is quite
common. However if you ask people in the grip of the Illusion whether
they understood their science teacher’s lesson on Archimedes’ Principle,
many would say “yes” without hesitation.\
 \
 [](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=6645583842972204443)MOOCs
to the rescue?\
 Let’s carry our self-experiment one step further to see how deep the
Illusion goes in this case. Perhaps Kahn Academy can help you solve the
iceberg challenge (assuming schooling has not). Khan’s curriculum on
Fluids, [Part
5](http://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/fluids/v/fluids--part-5)
and [Part
6](http://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/fluids/v/fluids--part-6),
constitute a formal presentation that, in principle, should allow you to
solve the problem as posed above. I invite you to watch those two videos
now and try to answer the Iceberg Challenge again.\
 \
 (Go ahead and watch the videos now. I'll wait…)\
 \
 How did you do? Were you able to resolve the iceberg challenge? Do you
feel more or less confident in your answer now? Khan claims that the
ability to control the pacing of the video and the opportunity to
re-watch the session will help. You may want to test those assumptions.
\
 \
 How to Develop *Authentic* Understanding\
 I have found that Khan – like the many others who use similar
instructional strategies both online and off – are overlooking over a
hundred years’ worth of discoveries in the learning sciences. Below, I
list five major discoveries that define requirements for achieving
authentic understanding (see the [companion
article](http://sloanconsortium.org/jaln/v17n4/khan-academy-illusion-understanding)
published in this month’s Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks for
additional detail):\

1.  Authentic understanding depends on hierarchically organized
    knowledge.
2.  Authentic understanding is grounded in direct experience.
3.  Authentic understanding is stabilized by practice (generally at
    every level within the hierarchy).
4.  Authentic understanding requires formative feedback.
5.  Authentic understanding is context-sensitive.

When these insights are ignored, as they are most of the time in online
instruction, educators and students risk reinforcing and perpetuating
the Illusion of Understanding, which I have observed in many classrooms
and in many countries. Typically the illusion unfolds in dramatic
fashion when teachers ask students to explain their answers, and the
students suddenly realize they can’t. Students find themselves
speechless or stuck in a rambling explanation that doesn’t even make
sense to them. I have even observed students give a correct explanation
and then admit they didn’t understand what they just said. Now, as the
teaching and learning enterprise unfolds on a world stage through a
variety of online platforms, we face the risk that the Illusion will be
even more widespread and difficult to dispel than ever.\
 \
 Assuming that your struggle with the above iceberg challenge is no
different than almost everyone who attempts the challenge, which of the
five observations seem relevant? Did you feel that you lacked the
perquisite experiences to reach an answer? Did your past experiences
feel relevant yet unconnected or unreliable? Did you feel like you
needed to practice some kind of mental exercise but did not know which
or how? These questions all underlie the complicated teaching and
learning environment that lead to authentic understanding. I don’t claim
that the process is easy, but the investment is necessary. The challenge
here should also underscore another illusion- that is, the illusion that
achieving expert status in one discipline - as a hedge fund manager, for
example - automatically transfers to another discipline, such as
teaching. Teachers, like hedge fund managers, spend decades to become
competent at their craft.\
 \
 If you do watch the videos, which of the five observations seem to be
relevant to your experience of understanding? You will note that Khan
does use a similar challenge in parts five and six of his video series,
but the context is different. Does that matter? In Part II we will
explore in further detail the Illusion of Understanding in the area of
math and explore what choices may be available to Khan and all
educators, especially those who work online, to better support authentic
understanding.

    Thank you for writing this - very well done!\

    I would recommend this video, from Derek Muller (Veritasium) on a
    related topic: "Khan Academy and the Effectiveness of Science

    Have you looked at Hubbard's research on the subject of learning,
    specifically what he called the "Three barriers to study?" \
    I've been using that stuff all my life and it is gold!\

    I could be wrong, but in my opinion you fall for an illusion
    yourself. There is a difference between understanding and skill. One
    is a variable and the other is a constant. When I have to solve a
    short task, why should I reduce the liquidity of my brain and
    imprint this solution as the median of all similar tasks although I
    do not know the range?\
    Same goes for your example about authentic understanding when
    students cannot give an answer although they should know, have they
    been taught the range of tasks? Have they been taught the range of
    solutions? Was there a chance to create a pattern, an emergent
    knowledge?\
    And how much does this affect my life when I have to pay a rent or
    had a big argument with my love? Emotions easily override and
    overwrite any common sense. That's why so many child prodigies fail
    once they reach puberty. Conclusion, if you want authentic
    understanding of a direct connection between task and solution, then
    why is science and education so emotionless? And why is this webpage
    clinically black and white?
