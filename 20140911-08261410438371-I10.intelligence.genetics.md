To what degree do genes determine how intelligent we are? It's a
question with a lot of social implications, given the potential for
people to get lumped into categories based on their inheritance—or for
them to make a self-fulfilling prophecy out of it.

But so far, at least, it's a question that science has been unable to
answer. When scientists have focused on specific genes involved in the
nervous system's growth and function, they've found a few hints of
associations, but those haven't held up in large population studies.
Large population studies that scanned the entire genome have also come
up empty.

Now, we may have a good idea why. A massive and thorough genetic study
has looked into the question and, despite all the effort involved, has
only come up with three genes, none of which have a very large effect on
cognitive abilities.

The work was done by a collaboration of nearly 60 scientists. Rather
than either looking at a specific set of candidate genes or scanning the
entire genome, they took a hybrid approach. Reasoning that intelligence
is likely correlated with academic achievement, they first did a scan of
the genome, looking for base differences that were associated with
educational attainment. This approach, called a "genome wide association
study," relies on tens of thousands of individual bases that normally
vary within human populations. To make sure that whatever came out was
likely to be significant, the work relied on a panel of over 100,000
participants.

This left them with over 900 individual sites in the genome. Many of
these, however, were physically close to each other, and thus were
almost certain to represent the effect of a single gene. Once this was
accounted for, the authors were left with 69 separate sites in the
genome. Those 69 locations were then tested in a separate population of
over 24,000 individuals, all of whom had been given tests that measured
their cognitive abilities.

To avoid some of the problems with the earlier work (which hadn't been
replicated), the authors had pre-registered this experimental design
with an [open science hosting site](https://osf.io/z7fe2/). They also
had two teams independently repeat and verify the analysis. So, from an
experimental perspective, the results are likely to be solid.

But from an informational perspective, they were rather weak. To begin
with, there was no significant correlation between educational
achievement and intelligence test scores associated with these sites in
the genome. (In fact, there was a weak *negative* correlation, but it
went away if you discarded a single extreme outlier.) In terms of
intelligence, the majority of the 69 sites the authors looked at were
within the 95 percent confidence interval, meaning they weren't
significantly different from random chance. Only three individual sites
appear to stand out above the statistical noise.

The effects size, which measures how large the influence of the genetic
regions is, was also quite small. Human height, notable as being
difficult to associate with a genetic influence, has genes with an
effect size 20 times larger. Even if someone had two copies of the
variants associated with intelligence at one of genes, their IQ would
get a boost of about half a point compared to someone who lacked them.

Then there's the three genes that are closest to these sites in the
genome. The authors don't mention much about them, and it's easy to see
why. None of them are clearly involved in nervous system development.
Only one of them looks like it might have a biological function that we
know about (it's related to enzymes that modify how DNA is stored in the
cell.) The second simply has a domain that typically is used to allow
two proteins to interact, while the third may not even exist—its recored
[was discontinued](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=LOC100129158)
after a reanalysis of genome data.

The authors say that to find anything else, we'll have to go to samples
that are larger still, which would involve a staggering number of
genetic tests. And, if these (and past) results are any guide, then
they're not likely to come up with anything very exciting.

All of which suggests that intelligence isn't a matter of a handful of
genes. Sure, there are some genes that, when damaged, have a
catastrophic effect on cognitive abilities. But, assuming you avoid
these, it seems that your intelligence is likely to be the product of a
huge collection of minor genetic effects, combined with a very large
helping of your environment.
