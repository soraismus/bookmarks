[What Are the Dangers of Using an Untrusted USB Drive?](http://lifehacker.com/what-are-the-dangers-of-using-an-untrusted-usb-drive-1533523741)
==============================================================================================================================================

![What Are the Dangers of Using an Untrusted USB
Drive?](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_ku-xlarge/fpoy62fpzboe5sq7eiig.jpg)S

**USB keys, pen drives, memory sticks—they're not necessarily as
harmless as you might think. Before you insert one that you don't 100%
trust, think about what might go wrong (hint: a lot). The Super Users at
[Stack
Exchange](http://superuser.com/?utm_source=lifehacker&utm_medium=syndication&utm_campaign=crowdhacker&utm_content=superuser-107)
list a few very realistic USB nightmare scenarios.**

**Suppose someone wants me to copy some files to their USB stick. I'm
running fully-patched Windows 7 x64 with AutoRun disabled (via Group
Policy). I insert the USB drive, open it in Windows Explorer, and copy
some files to it. I do not run or view any of the existing files. What
bad things could happen if I do this?****What about if I do this in
Linux (say, Ubuntu)?**

*See the original question
[here](http://superuser.com/q/709275/112560?utm_source=lifehacker&utm_medium=syndication&utm_campaign=crowdhacker&utm_content=superuser-107).*

#### Beware the Thumbs ([Answered by sylvainulg](http://superuser.com/a/709659/36310?utm_source=lifehacker&utm_medium=syndication&utm_campaign=crowdhacker&utm_content=superuser-107))

Less impressively, your GUI file browser will typically explore files to
create thumbnails. Any pdf-based, ttf-based, (insert turing-capable file
type here)-based exploit that works on your system could potentially be
launched passively by dropping the file and waiting for it to be scanned
by the thumbnail renderer. Most the exploits I know about that are for
Windows, though, but do not underestimate the updates for libjpeg.

#### Is It a USB, Really? ([Answered by terdon](http://superuser.com/a/709302/151431?utm_source=lifehacker&utm_medium=syndication&utm_campaign=crowdhacker&utm_content=superuser-107))

The worst that can happen is limited only by your attacker's
imagination. If you're going to be paranoid, physically connecting
pretty much any device to your system means it can be compromised.
Doubly so if that device looks like a simple USB stick.

What if it's this?

![What Are the Dangers of Using an Untrusted USB
Drive?](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_ku-xlarge/614356473733687585.jpg)S

Pictured above is the infamous USB [rubber
ducky](http://www.usbrubberducky.com/), a little device that looks like
a normal pen drive but can deliver arbitrary keystrokes to your
computer. Basically, it can do as it pleases because it registers itself
as a keyboard and then enters whatever sequence of keys it wants. With
that kind of access, it can do [all sorts of nasty
thing](https://forums.hak5.org/index.php?/topic/29959-payloads-duck-toolkit/)
(and that's just the first hit I found on Google). The thing is
scriptable so the sky's the limit.

#### File System Drivers are not Bug Free ([Answered by Zan Lynx](http://superuser.com/a/709393/4642?utm_source=lifehacker&utm_medium=syndication&utm_campaign=crowdhacker&utm_content=superuser-107))

Another danger is that Linux will try to mount anything (joke suppressed
here). Some of the file system drivers are not bug free. Which means
that a hacker could potentially find a bug in, say, squashfs, minix,
befs, cramfs or udf. Then that hacker could create a file system that
exploits that bug to take over a Linux kernel and put that on a USB
drive. This could theoretically happen to Windows as well. A bug in the
FAT or NTFS or CDFS or UDF driver could open up Windows to a takeover.

#### Are you Sure You're not Auto-Running? ([Answered by steve](http://superuser.com/a/709278/90061?utm_source=lifehacker&utm_medium=syndication&utm_campaign=crowdhacker&utm_content=superuser-107))

There are several security packages that allow me to set up an autorun
script for either Linux or Windows, automatically executing my malware
as soon as you plug it in. It is best not to plug in devices that you do
not trust!

Bear in mind, I can attach malicious software to pretty much any sort of
executable that I want, and for pretty much any OS. With autorun
disabled you *should* be safe, but again, I don't trust devices that I
am even the slightest bit skeptical about.

For an example of what can do this, check out [The Social-Engineer
Toolkit](https://www.trustedsec.com/downloads/social-engineer-toolkit/)
(SET). The *only* way to truly be safe is to boot up a live Linux
distribution, with your hard drive unplugged. Mount the USB drive and
take a look. Other than that, you're rolling the dice. As suggested, it
is a must that you disable networking. It doesn't help if your hard
drive is safe and your whole network gets compromised.
