Math for seven-year-olds: graph coloring, chromatic numbers, and Eulerian paths and circuits
============================================================================================

a guest today in my daughter’s second-grade classroom, full of
math-enthusiastic seven-and-eight-year-old girls, I led a mathematical
investigation of graph coloring, chromatic numbers, map coloring and
Eulerian paths and circuits. I brought in a pile of sample graphs I had
prepared, and all the girls made up their own graphs and maps to
challenge each other. By the end each child had compiled a mathematical
“coloring book” containing the results of their explorations. Let me
tell you a little about what we did.

We began with vertex coloring, where one colors the vertices of a graph
in such a way that adjacent vertices get different colors. We started
with some easy examples, and then moved on to more complicated graphs,
which they attacked.

[![Image

The aim is to use the fewest number of colors, and the [chromatic
number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring) of a graph is the
smallest number of colors that suffice for a coloring. The girls colored
the graphs, and indicated the number of colors they used, and we talked
as a group in several instances about why one needed to use that many
colors.

Next, the girls paired off, each making a challenge graph for her
partner, who colored it, and vice versa.

[![Image

coloring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_coloring), where one colors
the countries on a map in such a way that adjacent countries get
different colors, is of course closely related to graph coloring.

[![Image
(20)](http://jdh.hamkins.org/files/2014/05/Image-20-201x300.jpg)](http://jdh.hamkins.org/files/2014/05/Image-20.jpg)The
girls made their own maps to challenge each other, and then undertook to
color those maps. We discussed the remarkable fact that four colors
suffice to color any map. [![Image

Next, we considered [Eulerian paths and
circuits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path), where one traces
through all the edges of a graph without lifting one’s pencil and
without retracing any edge more than once. We started off with some easy
examples, but then considered more difficult cases. [![Image
(29)](http://jdh.hamkins.org/files/2014/05/Image-29-300x218.jpg)](http://jdh.hamkins.org/files/2014/05/Image-29.jpg)

[![Image
(28)-002](http://jdh.hamkins.org/files/2014/05/Image-28-002-218x300.jpg)](http://jdh.hamkins.org/files/2014/05/Image-28-002.jpg)An
Eulerian *circuit* starts and ends at the same vertex, but an Eulerian
*path* can start and end at different vertices.

[![Image
(30)-001](http://jdh.hamkins.org/files/2014/05/Image-30-001-197x300.jpg)](http://jdh.hamkins.org/files/2014/05/Image-30-001.jpg)We
discussed the fact that some graphs have no Eulerian path or circuit. If
there is a circuit, then every time you enter a vertex, you leave it on
a fresh edge; and so there must be an even number of edges at each
vertex. With an Eulerian path, the starting and ending vertices (if
distinct) will have odd degree, while all the other vertices will have
even degree.

It is a remarkable fact that amongst connected finite graphs, those
necessary conditions are also sufficient. One can prove this by building
up an Eulerian path or circuit (starting and ending at the two
odd-degree nodes, if there are such); every time one enters a new
vertex, there will be an edge to leave on, and so one will not get
stuck. If some edges are missed, simply insert suitable detours to pick
them up, and again it will all match up into a single path or circuit as
desired. (But we didn’t dwell much on this proof in the second-grade
class.)

this was an excellent opportunity to talk about The Seven Bridges of
Königsberg. Is it possible to tour the city, while crossing each bridge
exactly once?[![Image
(31)-001](http://jdh.hamkins.org/files/2014/05/Image-31-001-181x300.jpg)](http://jdh.hamkins.org/files/2014/05/Image-31-001.jpg)

The final result: a booklet of fun graph problems!

[![Graph Coloring
Booklet](http://jdh.hamkins.org/files/2014/05/Graph-Coloring-Booklet-199x300.jpg)](http://jdh.hamkins.org/files/2014/05/Graph-Coloring-Booklet.jpg)

The high point of the day occurred in the midst of our graph-coloring
activity when one little girl came up to me and said, “I want to be a
mathematician!” What a delight!

I have made [a kit of my original uncolored
pages](https://plus.google.com/102347204476260637672/posts/hsDuB5ZeBL2)
available, if anyone should want to use them to make their own booklets.
Just print them out, copy double-sided (with correct orientation), and
fold the pages to assemble into a booklet; a few staples can serve as a
binding.

See also my [followup question on
MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/q/168619/1946), for the grown-ups,
concerning the computational difficulty of producing hard-to-color maps
and graphs.

    As a bit of practical advice, this was more than enough material for
    a one hour session. Indeed, one could easily fill an hour with just
    the coloring topics, saving the Eulerian paths and circuits, as well
    as the booklet assembly, for another session. We chose instead to
    leave some of the larger graphs for coloring later or at home, which
    I think would be good, especially if it leads to mathematical
    discussions at home. Another issue was that it was more complicated
    than I had expected to arrange for the kids to draw graphs and maps
    in each other’s booklets, and so some care should go into organizing
    this.

    So beautiful!\
     If mathematics was taught in this way the school would have been a
    thousand times more exciting…I always thought that the trick to keep
    the students engaged and interested is to give them interesting
    problem, opportunities to achieve results independently. imho..

    ps:I apologize for my bad english

        The combination of mathematical thinking with coloring activity
        makes it ideal for young kids. But truthfully, I think the
        activity is fun for basically any age, and many parents have

    This is wonderful material for a math circle! As an extension, you
    could also do chromatic numbers in 3D by using gumdrops and
    toothpicks. (I.e., a child can see that the chromatic number of a
    tetrahedron is 4 because it takes 4 different colors of gumdrops to
    build it if we follow the rule that every toothpick must have 2
    different colors on its ends.)

    BTW, I have a blog with other great activities for a math circle for
    7 year olds:\

    This is great! Thanks for making the booklet available as well.
    Going to print it out and use it with my 8- and 6-year olds.

    This is awesome! I absolutely love this and intend to do some
    similar activities with my 11 and 12 year olds. Thanks

    It’s nice to see you’re teaching them the Peterson graph already!

        I’m glad you noticed. It is beautiful after all, and
        seven-year-olds can 3-color it, although they find it a
        challenge to do so.

    A friend shared this on Facebook, and as a former math teacher and
    later professor (and implicitly long-time math student) this is just
    the kind of thing that should be in the curriculum. It’s wonderful,
    and I’m going to bookmark this for when I get to guest lecture in my
    daughters’ math classes. (As an aside, I remember my father talking
    to my class about probability when I was in elementary school, and I
    wound up a mathematician, so good luck to your daughter).
