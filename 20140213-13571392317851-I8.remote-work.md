### Organizations

-   **[NPR](/organizations/npr/)

For the last two-and-a-half years I’ve been a 100% remote worker, first
on [PANDA Project](http://pandaproject.net/) and now with [NPR
visuals](http://blog.apps.npr.org/). Recently, several people have asked
me how I make this work. At the same time, I’ve taken on new
responsibilities at NPR as a project manager. This change has brought
into sharp relief the things I’ve learned about how to work effectively
from far away. Whereas I used to only have to figure out how to
coordinate with my own small team, I now routinely connect remotely with
our stakeholders, sponsorship and marketing departments, member
stations, and more.

![My view for NPR visuals 10:00 am (ET) scrum. On this morning there

My view for NPR visuals 10:00 am (ET) scrum. On this morning there were
so many of us that several people are off the left and right sides of
the camera.

In this piece, I’ll codify some of the lessons I’ve learned. If you’re
already a remote developer, you may pick up some new tricks and a more
rigorous way of thinking about how you work. If you are planning to go
remote, oh boy, you should clear your calendar because I have so many
things to tell you. Effective remote work comes down to maintaining
those things which are necessary no matter where you work—organization,
communication and motivation.

![What my coworkers see. If you’re curious about the thing on the wall,
well, so is everybody else. It makes for a great long-distance
icebreaker.](https://source.opennews.org/media/img/uploads/article_images/2-at-work_1.jpg)

What my coworkers see. If you’re curious about the thing on the wall,
well, so is everybody else. It makes for a great long-distance
icebreaker.

### Staying organized

It goes without saying that if you’re going to be apart from your team,
you need to take responsibility for your own organization. What may be
less obvious is that you’re going to need to take that organization to
much greater lengths than would probably otherwise be necessary. Why?
The lack of tangible reminders. It’s amazing how much we rely on subtle
environmental and social cues for how and when things get done. If you
never lock eyes with a homepage producer, you might forget to tell them
about an impending launch.

In lieu of these contextual, human reminders, you’re going to need to
rely on systems to help you remember. Whenever possible, you should use
systems that allow you to collaborate directly with your coworkers. The
most basic example of this is your office calendaring software. Going
remote has taught me the value of having a schedule. Your calendar
software does lots of smart things for you, like compensating for time
zones and preventing conflicts. The most important thing it does for you
is prevent other people from creating conflicts for you. (You can’t just
“not be around” when you work remotely.)

> half-hour they get out of school for the next ten years. In practice
> nobody will even notice you’ve done this and it will save you the

![Get yourself a nice multi-timezone clock. It’s invaluable and looks

Get yourself a nice multi-timezone clock. It’s invaluable and looks
cool. The Nexus 7’s clock works great for this.

The flip-side of this is that you’ll often be scheduling meetings for a
group of folks who aren’t remote. When you do this you need to keep
their needs in mind. Don’t schedule meetings for ten people and just
send them a Google Hangout URL. Make sure a room is available
(preferably one on their floor), reserve it and then annotate the
calendar event with the location. Do yourself a favor and appoint
someone to make sure the A/V setup in the room works well a few minutes
before the meeting starts. Taking up a dozen people’s time with your
telepresence issues is even more annoying than just being late. Everyone
can relate to being late, but not everyone can relate to being
unintelligibly garbled or echoing like the Grand Canyon.

> “5555”, instead of your whole number.

Beyond calendaring and meeting coordination, it’s important to extend
your organized persona into other interactions with your team. The best
example I can offer of this is being rigorous in your usage of
tickets/issues. If you’re a programmer this *should* already be second
nature, but even if you aren’t, you should be using some way of tracking
who is working on what. Making sure everyone is being prompt and
thorough in their ticketing can massively reduce the friction of remote
collaboration. It simply minimizes *how often* you actually need to talk
by making that information readily available to everyone on the team.

### Staying in communication

No ticketing system will allow you to completely avoid conversation, and
the synchronous part of remote collaboration is really where the bytes
hit the information super highway. It goes without saying that modern
tools like real-time video chat have made this style of work possible,
but they aren’t a cure-all and they can be used ineffectively. I
recommend a two-pronged approach to synchronous communication: one-part
text chat and one-part video chat. Using each to its maximum potential
requires some consideration.

For text chat our team uses [Hipchat](http://hipchat.com), a wonderful
piece of software that has Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux *and* web
clients. Among its charms are its image sharing integration and its
capacity to quickly spin up ad-hoc chat rooms. This is our “always-on
backchannel,” which is to say that during working hours our entire team
is in this chat. This serves a number of purposes:

-   It reduces the number of unnecessary phone or video calls that get
    made, because, “Hey, did you get that thing I sent you?” is much
    faster in text.
-   It serves as a status indicator of who is at work (available = green
    light), who is at lunch (away = yellow light) and who is out (not
    online).
-   It can be ignored. Sometimes you just need to focus. Text chat is
    asynchronous when you need it to be.
-   It’s perfect for quickly bringing the entire team up to date on the
    latest funny GIFs of football players crying or cats dancing. (Or if
    the production servers are down.)

When the backchannel isn’t good enough, then you switch into video chat
mode. *Never* use a phone if you can video chat. Body language matters,
even when you’re talking about database normalization. It’s the
difference between “I don’t want to do it this way” and “I will hate my
job for the next week if we do it this way.” You should get comfortable
jumping into a Hangout even if it’s only for a five minute conversation.
In fact, you should get comfortable telling people to do it. Don’t be
afraid. It may annoy somebody once, but they’ll quickly get used to it
and it’s much better than the alternative miscommunications.

> **Pro tip:** If you have a [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com/) in your
> backchannel, you can snag our [hangouts
> script](https://github.com/nprapps/totebot2/blob/master/scripts/hangouts.coffee)
> to automatically generate new hangouts on demand!

Among the best things you can do for yourself as a remote employee is to
get comfortable asking for help. You’re going to need somebody to make
sure the A/V in the conference room works. You’re going to need somebody
to wander the halls looking for that stakeholder who can’t find the
conference room in the first place. You’re going to need somebody to
assure less technically savvy people that your presence in the room is
not magic. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. You’re all on the same team
and it’s in everyone’s interest to make things work.

### Remote-work gear worth having

Your work is going to depend on video chat, so invest in a good quality
webcam. Expense it if you can, but if you can’t, buy one anyway. I
recommend the [Logitech
C525](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Webcam-Portable-Calling-Autofocus/dp/B004WO8HQ4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391745477&sr=8-1&keywords=logitech+c525).
It’s simple, inexpensive, and a huge upgrade over even the current
generation MacBook’s embedded webcam. Your own meaningful body language
will suddenly be visible to the rest of the team.

While you’re shopping, buy a pair of document cameras too. This is one
of those wonderful bits of technology you don’t know you need. They are
especially helpful for UX wire-framing and UI sketching, but I bet
you’ll find other uses for them too. I recommend the [Ipevo
Ziggi-HD](http://www.amazon.com/Ziggi-HD-High-Definition-Document-Camera-CDVU-04IP/dp/B008DBF5Z8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391745602&sr=8-1&keywords=ziggi+hd).
They also make a nice [travel
case](http://www.amazon.com/IPEVO-Carrying-Ziggi-HD-Document-Camera/dp/B0093TVWGA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1391745602&sr=8-2&keywords=ziggi+hd)
for it if you, like me, work from more than one location.

![A stereo A/B switch is a simple but invaluable device for your home
office.](https://source.opennews.org/media/img/uploads/article_images/4-switch.jpg)

A stereo A/B switch is a simple but invaluable device for your home
office.

If you switch back and forth between headphones and speakers a lot you
can build yourself a little stereo A/B switch like one pictured above
for just a few bucks. If you’re not handy with a soldering iron you can
buy a really overpriced one on
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Sescom-SES-IPOD-AB-Stereo-MP3-Player/dp/B005TE7GP4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1391780149&sr=8-2&keywords=headphone+ab+switch).
It will save you constantly plugging and unplugging your headphones and,
as side-benefit, it also serves as an inline mute switch when you have
telepresence echo issues. I can just leave my speakers off and flip over
to them when I’m talking to mute the echo.

### Staying motivated

![Staying
motivated](/media/cache/0a/35/0a3513a1c6f0b0db8cac8b46d333112e.jpg)

At work you bring something to remind you of home. At home you need
something to remind you of work. To wit, this lovely letterpress of our
team motto by [Alyson Hurt](http://twitter.com/alykat).

You can master organization and communication, but those things won’t
keep you from sometimes feeling horribly disconnected from your team and
your mission. Do not despair. This is normal. There are several things
you can do to combat the disconnected feeling of working apart from your
teammates.

The single best advice I got when I went remote was from [Matt
Waite](https://twitter.com/mattwaite), who said, “Put on pants,” by
which I’m pretty sure he meant, “Act like you’re going to work.” Get up,
put on clothes you’d leave the house in, take a look in the mirror, and
go to your work space. It is essential that you have a room (or nook) in
your house that you use only for work. You need a place to go to at the
start of the day and leave at the end. I even put an office nameplate
over mine. Do the same things you would if you were going to *the*
office. This might sound silly, but it will help keep you sane. Think of
your home workspace like an exclave of your company’s offices. Act like
you might run into your editor or the CEO at any moment! It’ll make you
feel normal.

![Now entering my
office.](https://source.opennews.org/media/img/uploads/article_images/5-office_1.jpg)

Now entering my office.

That being said, you also own your office, so you don’t have to deck it
out with cubicle swag. Make yourself a very comfortable space to work
in. My recommendations: big speakers, high-quality headphones, a
comfortable desk (and an
[Aeron](http://www.amazon.com/Aeron-Chair-Herman-Miller-Adjustable/dp/B003M1C7XW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391781170&sr=8-1)
or
[Leap](http://www.amazon.com/Steelcase-Leap-Fabric-Chair-Black/dp/B006H1QYBA)
chair if you don’t stand), some nice pictures, and maybe even windows.
Embrace the fact that you get to work at home. Sometimes my stereo
competes with the helicopters that land at the hospital down the street.
My coworkers don’t know the difference.

Force yourself to work reasonable hours. This is an easy one to screw
up. If you’re comfortable and you like your job it’s pretty easy to just
keep working until it’s time for bed. Don’t do it—unless you’re on
deadline and then only if you can’t cut features instead of working into
the night. Take breaks, walk outside, drink coffee, etc. You wouldn’t
spend four solid hours at your desk if you worked in the office. You
would talk to your coworkers or go for a walk once in a while. Try to
maintain that normalcy and it will help the rest to feel normal.

It’s my earnest belief that some people will have higher expectations
for you because you work remotely. It’s very easy for them to believe
you’re in your underwear playing Final Fantasy instead of slogging
through the documentation for Django. Not all work has obvious output
and when they can’t see you at your desk, it’s tempting to log those
blank hours as time wasted. There is absolutely nothing you can do about
this, so I suggest you embrace their high standards. Aim to excel. You
already have a tremendous productivity advantage because no one can
interrupt you at your own house unless you let them. Eventually you will
win people over and it won’t matter so much anyway, but it may take you
a while.

And a final word: visit the office. If you’re in the same foxhole, but
you’re never celebrating together, then it just isn’t the same. Visit
your team as often as is realistic. At NPR I plan to visit at least once
every three months. When you’re there get outside the office together.
It pays to remind one other that nobody is just a face on a screen.

### A few words for programmers

I’ve attempted to construct my advice in a way that would be useful to
programmers and non-programmers alike. In general the same challenges
crop up, but there are a few specific nuggets of advice I can offer to
programmers:

-   Consistency is even more important when you’re not in constant
    contact. If you don’t have a [style
    guide](https://github.com/nprapps/bestpractices), write one. It’s
    crucial towards alleviating the frustration that arises from
    inconsistent programming practices.
-   Documentation: just do it. You really have to. Absolutely nobody is
    going to remember how to load that database dump you created (or
    even where it is). Document your processes, preferably by making
    them dead simple to repeat. Have READMEs. Have a spreadsheet index
    of your servers. Every minute you spend writing documentation is
    five minutes saved talking on the phone.
-   You should be pair programming. Doing this remotely can be very
    tricky. It will never be as good as passing a keyboard around can
    be, but you should do it anyway. If a screen share in a Hangout is
    all you can manage then do that, especially if you have junior
    programmers who will benefit from the collaboration.
    [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) sessions can also be used to
    enable pairing in the command line, which is especially useful for
    [vim](http://www.vim.org/) users. For something more integrated,
    we’ve recently had very good experiences with
    [Floobits](http://floobits.com), though it’s still relatively new,
    so our opinions are subject to change.

This is everything I’ve learned in two-and-a-half years of remote
development. It’s a process I’m constantly iterating, especially now
that I’m working more with folks outside our team. However, I think at
the end of the day any future improvements I make will fall into these
problem categories of organization, communication, and motivation. These
are the dragons you’ve got to slay if you’re going to work far from your
team. It *is* possible. It can be good. It’s not a choice you should
make lightly, but if you decide to make the leap, you deserve to do it
well.
