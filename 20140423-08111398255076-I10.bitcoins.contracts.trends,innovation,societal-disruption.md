Bitcoin 2.0: Unleash The Sidechains

Next Story

#### Nike Is Said To Be Killing Off The FuelBand

![image](http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/broad_chain_closeup.jpg?w=400)

“Cryptocurrencies will create a fifth protocol layer powering the next
generation of the Internet,”
[says](http://startupboy.com/2014/04/01/the-fifth-protocol/) Naval
Ravikant. “Our 2014 fund will be built during the blockchain cycle,”
[concurs](http://avc.com/2014/04/the-mobile-downturn/) Fred Wilson. And
Andreessen Horowitz have very visibly [doubled
down](http://a16z.com/tag/bitcoin/) on Bitcoin.

Even if you don’t believe in Bitcoin as a currency, and I’ll grant
there’s plenty to be skeptical about, you should be thinking: *huh, a
lot of extremely smart and successful people think that its underlying
technology is a pretty big deal*. But as I wrote myself [just a few
weeks
ago](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/22/enter-the-blockchain-how-bitcoin-can-turn-the-cloud-inside-out/),
there’s a big difference between blockchain technology and Bitcoin
itself, right?

…Maybe not.

A brief technical refresher: “blockchains” are the distributed-consensus
technology introduced to the world by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto,
wherein a peer-to-peer network is used to codify and cryptographically
verify transactions, without any central authority. What’s more,
transactions can be orchestrated by programmable
[contracts](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts).

Bitcoin is both the first and most successful blockchain application,
but there are [many, many other](http://www.followthecoin.com/)
“cryptocurrencies,” known as “altcoins.” What’s more, there are numerous
other, non-currency applications being built on new blockchains, notably
[Namecoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namecoin) and
[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), and several proposals for
expanding and evolving Bitcoin itself, eg
[ZeroCoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zerocoin),
[MasterCoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastercoin), [Colored
Coins](http://www.coindesk.com/colored-coins-paint-sophisticated-future-for-bitcoin/),
etc.

I realize this all sounds like abstruse hair-splitting to those not yet
mentally invested in cryptocurrencies; but as Ravikant put it at TC
Disrupt seven months ago:

> Naval Ravikant (@[naval](https://twitter.com/naval)) just compared
> Bitcoin today to TCP/IP in 1995. I'm not saying he's necessarily
> wrong, but that's a bold statement.— \
> Jon Evans (@rezendi) [September 10,
> 2013](http://twitter.com/#!/rezendi/status/377484878033338368)

…so, continuing that metaphor, imagine for a moment that it’s 1995 and
you’re just beginning to notice that, over the last year or two, those
weird crusty techies who sit in the corner have all started talking
excitedly about “HTTP” and “HTML” and “cookies” … which apparently power
this thing called the “web.”

So. We’ve got Bitcoin and its blockchain; and we’ve got scores if not
hundreds of other blockchains, powering various altcoins and Namecoin
and ([soon](http://blog.ethereum.org/)) Ethereum et al. But blockchains,
like social networks, benefit from a [network
effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law). The most popular
becomes the most resilient, the most powerful, the most valuable; and
Bitcoin’s blockchain is, by far, the big dog today. These two facts have
provoked a certain amount of [anti-altcoin
vitriol](http://themisescircle.org/blog/2014/03/14/the-coming-demise-of-the-altcoins/).

On the other hand, other blockchains are where most of the interesting
innovation is happening. Namecoin as a DNS replacement; Ethereum as a
generic platform for any kind of blockchain technology; hopefully some
kind of [blockchain replacement for X.509
certificates](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/03/crypto_boffins_propose_getting_rid_of_cas/);
[SolarCoin](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/solarcoin-is-bitcoin-for-solar/250196/)
for solar power; Dogecoin for those of us who love absurdism for its own
sake; etc etc etc. The Bitcoin blockchain, despite/because of the
[megawatts](http://www.coindesk.com/carbon-footprint-bitcoin/) of power
poured into it, has grown sluggish and slow to change, a victim of its
own success, which impedes the pace of innovation…

…or so I thought, until I met with Austin Hill and Adam Back. Hill is
the former founder and CEO of [Zero-Knowledge
Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Knowledge_Systems), a
multi-million-dollar startup that was a good 15-20 years ahead of its
time; Back is the inventor of the Hashcash algorithm which powers
Bitcoin. They have considerable credibility, in other words — and
they’re building a stealth “Blockchain 2.0″ startup, based in part on
the notion of
“[sidechains](http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/adam-back-sidechains-can-replace-altcoins-bitcoin-2-0-platforms/2014/04/10).”

[Sidechains](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/blockchain-2-0-let-a-thousand-chains-blossom/)
are [new
blockchains](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/e99-sidechain-innovation/) which
are backed by Bitcoins, via [Bitcoin
contracts](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts), just as dollars and
pounds used to be backed by cold hard gold. You could in principle have
thousands of sidechains “pegged” to Bitcoin, all with different
characteristics and purposes … and all of them taking advantage of the
scarcity and resilience guaranteed by the main Bitcoin blockchain, which
in turn could iterate to implement experimental sidechain features once
they have been tried and tested.

If sidechains take off, though — which will [require some changes to the
core Bitcoin
protocol](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-core-developers-bitcoin-side-chains/)
— this probably bodes
[ill](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/22na59/sidechains_the_coming_death_of_altcoins_and/)
for the existing altcoins. Not surprisingly, the proposal has attracted
a [fair amount of
skepticism](http://www.brantonbits.com/blog/2014/04/11/bitcoin-2-dot-0-side-chains/),
not least from Vitalik Buterin, the chief scientist of Ethereum, who
[argues](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/12349/side-chains-challenges-potential/)
that sidechains require not just protocol changes but “the permission
and active assistance of 50% of all Bitcoin mining pool operators.”

Why should you care? Two main reasons. One: because if Ravikant, Wilson,
Andreessen, Hill, Back, etc. are correct, then in the long run,
blockchain-backed cryptocurrencies could become the substrate of entire
economies. Hill
[says](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/blockchain-2-0-let-a-thousand-chains-blossom/):
“I want to build a blockchain that could support a nation-state putting
its national currency and phasing out paper dollars.”

Or, as A16Z’s Balaji Srinivasan describes a
different-but-similarly-ambitious notion:

> The ability to clone a whole economy upon disagreement & let groups go
> their own ways might have just been invented.
> [bitcointalk.org/index.php?topi…](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563925.0)—
> \
> Balaji S. Srinivasan (@balajis) [April 12,
> 2014](http://twitter.com/#!/balajis/status/454892068427411456)

Two: because, as Hill said to me,

> Never mind “don’t be evil”; we want to build a company that actually
> **can’t** be evil.

…by which he means, an organization which is limited by contractual
obligations built into and enforced by its blockchain(s).

> @[dozba](https://twitter.com/dozba) Can't be evil: argument from

> Balaji S. Srinivasan (@balajis) [April 12,
> 2014](http://twitter.com/#!/balajis/status/455119978945978368)

The distributed nature of Bitcoin has caused people to speculate about
[autonomous
corporations](http://btcgeek.com/dawn-of-autonomous-corporations/)
powered by blockchains, which sounds like a creepy Kafka-meets-Gibson
notion if I ever heard one. On the other hand, a company which committed
to behaving in a particular way, not with a mere promise, but with an
enforceable and cryptographically ironclad contract, might be much
worthier of the public’s trust than your standard amoral corporation.

This is, of course, all highly speculative verging on cloud-cuckoo-land
until people actually start shipping code which turns these notions into
reality. What interests me most about sidechains is that, if
implemented, they might bring that day closer, by aiding and
accelerating the entire ecosystem of blockchain
[innovation](http://www.dailydot.com/technology/toroken-tor-bitcoin-anonymity/).
And I’m awfully curious about what Hill and Back still have up their
sleeve ([no, they didn’t tell
me](https://twitter.com/austinhill/status/457308390390104064).)
Interesting times indeed.
