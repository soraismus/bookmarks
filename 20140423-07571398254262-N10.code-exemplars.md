This is one my favourite questions, asked by idlewords:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=879101 But its been a long time
since then, and with a new set of programming languages, I believe there
are new code bases that's worth studying about and learning from. So,
which code-base should I be reading about to improve myself?

 == Vim or Emacs ==

Just pick one and force yourself to use it to the exclusion of other
editors. Future you will thank you later, because you'll still be using
it 20 years from now. "We are typists first, programmers second" comes
to mind. You need to be able to move chunks of code around, substitute
things with regexes, use marks, use editor macros, etc.

== 6.824: Distributed Systems ==

[http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824-2013/](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824-2013/)
Do each lab. Read the discussion and rtm's course notes.

How to write C. Study the "meta," that is, the choice of how the
codebase is structured and the ruthless attention to detail. Pay
attention to how functions are commented, both in the body of the
function and in the prototypes. Use doxygen to help you navigate the
codebase. Bonus: that'll teach you how to use doxygen to navigate a
codebase.

Read the book. Force yourself to read it in its entirety. Use the source
code PDF to study how to turn theory into practice.

== Arc ==

[http://ycombinator.com/arc/arc3.1.tar](http://ycombinator.com/arc/arc3.1.tar)

You're not studying Arc to learn Arc. You're studying Arc to learn how
to implement Arc. You'll learn the power of anaphoric macros. You'll
learn the innards of Racket.

Questions to ask yourself: Why did Racket as a platform make it easier
to implement Arc than, say, C/Golang/Ruby/Python? Now pick one of those
and ask yourself: what would be required in order to implement Arc on
that platform? For example, if you say "C," a partial answer would be
"I'd have to write my own garbage collector," whereas for Golang or Lua
that wouldn't be the case.

The enlightenment experience you want out of this self-study is
realizing that it's very difficult to express the ideas embodied in the
Arc codebase any more succinctly without sacrificing its power and
flexibility.

Now implement the four 6.824 labs in Arc. No, I'm not kidding. I've done
it. It won't take you very long at this point. You'll need to read the
RPC section of Golang's standard library and understand how it works,
then port those ideas to Arc. Don't worry about making it nice; just
make it work. Port the lab's unit tests to Arc, then ensure your Arc
version passes those tests. The performance is actually not too bad: the
Arc version runs only a few times slower than the Golang version if I
remember correctly.

== Matasano crypto challenges ==

[http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/](http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/)
Just trust me on this one. They're cool and fun and funny. If you've
ever wanted to figure out how to steal encrypted song lyrics from the
70's, look no further.

 *== Tarsnap ==*

When you're reading this code, be aware that it's a bit of a mongrel --
the code in /libarchive/ and most of /tar/foo (but not /tar/foo/foo) is
from the libarchive project and is not mine. So if you're looking to
learn "how Colin codes", look at /libcperciva/, /lib/, and /tar/foo/.

s/foo/\*/ in the above. Autoitalicization breaks path globs...

I just had another look at the tarsnap source code, and while I know
Percival is a great guy, and I can't imagine him suing over "mis-use",
the bulk of the code is under a pretty restrictive lisence:

"Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, without
modification, is permitted for the sole purpose of using the "tarsnap"
backup service provided by Colin Percival."

That is, except the code under "libcperciva" which appears to be under a
traditional 2-clause BSD license.

So, for example using the bsdtar.c file to teach yourself how to handle
command line arguments might be a bit dicey, as it's entirely unclear
which part of that file is under the BSD license, and which part you're
not allowed to distribute.

It's one of the reasons why I'd which Percival made the entire thing
available under a dual license (eg: BSD) and simply required people to
use the official client for the tarsnap service.

Then again, I'm not used to audit closed source software, and therefore
probably extra scared of what might happen if I accidentially learn
something from reading said source... ;-)

On the other hand, Percival *does* publish quite a lot of stuff that's
[ed: entirely free], such as spiped
[https://www.tarsnap.com/spiped.html](https://www.tarsnap.com/spiped.html)

 Actually, it's an important point. One way to learn a given coding
technique is to copy-paste it into your own project, modify it until it
works, and then delete it and re-implement it yourself. (The "delete and
then reimplement it yourself" is the important part. Don't just
copy-paste code!) That way you can build up an understanding of the code
as you go, without having to understand it in its entirety from scratch.
Understanding it in its entirety from scratch is the better way, because
it gives you a deeper understanding, but people learn in different ways.

Anyway, illegal is illegal, and copy-pasting from Tarsnap would be
illegal. I didn't know Tarsnap was under a restrictive license. It's a
shame that people will have to be so careful when learning from Tarsnap,
as it's a paragon of modern C best practices, but maybe the license is
shrewd.

Though I wish the mentality of "my competitors might steal the code!"
will die its deserved death, since evidence thus far suggests it's just
paranoia. For example, the codecombat guys open sourced everything and
have been fine:
[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7015126](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7015126)
(But of course that's easy for me to say when I have no competitors to
worry about!)

 *Though I wish the mentality of "my competitors might steal the code!"

Well, Tarsnap *is* online backup for the truly paranoid... ;-)

Seriously though: I never thought this was *likely* to be a problem, but
given that I was spending a significant chunk of my life on this, I
wanted to eliminate obvious risks to my livelihood. I like not starving.

But I've done my best to put the "reusable for a purpose other than
building Tarsnap" code into the separate libcperciva tree. And I'm sure
that merely *reading* code to learn from it is not a copyright violation
-- there are no laws about copying information into your brain,
thankfully. So please, read the code, and email me if you see any bugs;
I wouldn't be offering bug bounties if I didn't want people to look at
the code!

 I suspect that your suggested use of the code would fall under the fair
use statute in 17 U.S.C. § 107 and the guidelines from *Folsom v. Marsh*
since it seems explicitly for pedagogical or research purposes.

 When I first started programming, a lot of the licensing rhetoric
seemed like much ado about nothing. "Look at all these people squabbling
about who's allowed to do what with text! It's text! Sheesh!"

But one quickly realizes that the concept of software license
restrictions is a fundamental reason for the strength and momentum of
open source software. Therefore, it must be true that a central tenant
of being a good developer is to respect software licenses. Not merely
respect them to the letter of how they're written, but to respect their
spirit as well. If an author wishes you don't do something with their
code, then you don't do it. There are plenty of reasons why this should
be the case, but the most compelling for me is that it'd be lame to
ignore the author's wishes while using their work, even if the author
won't ever know about it.

If people are still feeling tempted to lift code, well... Remember that
you only get to destroy your reputation once.

 Not at first. But work with people you like and respect, and learn from
them. Then ask them when looking for your next job.

Any place worth working isn't looking for the absolute best candidate
for X at any cost. A good fit with someone with a good work ethic who
wants to learn always works out better than just raw expertise. And a
reference from someone you both respect is the fastest most reliable
place to find them.

 It really depends on the co-worker and the culture of the company.
Sometimes I would tell co-workers, sometimes I wouldn't say anything
because I was concerned they would leak that to management and I would
be asked to leave before I was ready.

Everyone is helpful when someone says they are looking, even if it is

 *\> Any place worth working isn't looking for the absolute best

That's so true. If they absolutely need the best candidate, they are
about to run a very risky project.

Good management means, among others, to ensure that new people have the
opportunity to learn and to "get into" the project. If management
requires the "best" developers, it really means that the management is
bad and the developers are supposed to make up for that.

(Having said that, there are also people who are simply a sunken cost.
That is, managing them requires more resources than the value they
produce. However, that's the other end of the scale, and a separate
topic.)

 Well, the point is to self-study, so I'm reluctant to share my code
because people will wind up crippling themselves if they fall back on
whatever solutions I came up with. If they read my code before
attempting their own solution, then they risk overlooking a simpler
solution or one better suited for their own purposes. But... I guess
I'll share a side-by-side go/arc comparison of lab 1. Lab 1 itself is
pretty simple; most of the work was to port some of go's primitives to
arc, like channels.

All diffs between my local codebase and the stock arc 3.1:

I was interested in seeing how much code can be eliminated by using Arc
instead of Go. Turns out: quite a lot. The server is almost 200 lines of
Go code, but about 65 of Arc. The client is almost 120 lines of Go,
about 35 of Arc. The unit tests are pretty similar in length (\~480 vs
\~410) but the Arc version is easier for me to read since there's less
visual noise.

Anyway it was fun.

 I don't think you'll be able to access these. My university uses Piazza
as well and you need a university .edu email address to get access to
the Piazza boards.

Fortunately, if the way MIT uses Piazza is anything like the way my
school does you aren't missing much. Usually people just use Piazza to
clarify something that was glossed over in lecture or to get help on
some aspect of the homework.

 Thanks for the long, detailed quality post.

OT question, what's up with programmers and "Zen and the Art of

one of the exceptions. After an idea saying something like "we can't
define quality ergo everything is quality" or something of the sorts I
had to put it down, nothing made any sense and it all seemed to be a
grandiose philosophical scheme based on random half-baked ideas.

 I think you get more benefit from reading code if you study something
very close to what you are working on yourself, something in the same
domain, in the same framework perhaps, or at least in the same
programming language, at best something you are deeply involved in
currently.

I never seem to get enough motivation to read deeply into random "grand"
code bases like Lua or SQLLite, but some months ago I got into the habit
of always studying a bunch of projects that use a given technology
before I use this technology, and it greatly decreased the amount of
time it takes me to get to a "idiomatic" coding style. So instead of
diving in a random, I would recommend making researching existing
code-bases related to what you are currently doing an integral part of
your workflow.

 I really enjoy doing this as well. Are you aware of any resources or
metrics (number of contributors on github, etc.) to find which projects
are "well crafted" in X framework/language?

Perhaps I overestimate how much risk there is in learning idiomatic
practices from a project which is not actually all that idiomatic. I
like the assurance that what I read is quality, especially with
frameworks or languages I'm very new to where it can be tough to tell.

 Slightly off topic, but Peter Seibel's take on the idea of code reading
groups, and the idea of code as literature, is interesting:
[http://www.gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/)

"Code is not literature and we are not readers. Rather, interesting
pieces of code are specimens and we are naturalists. So instead of
trying to pick out a piece of code and reading it and then discussing it
like a bunch of Comp Lit. grad students, I think a better model is for
one of us to play the role of a 19th century naturalist returning from a
trip to some exotic island to present to the local scientific society a
discussion of the crazy beetles they found."

The reason this is off topic is that it sounds like you were after
interesting specimens anyway. I don't have any code examples as such,
although if algorithms count I'm particularly fond of Tarjan's algorithm
for finding strongly connected components in a directed graph, and the
Burrows-Wheeler transform (as used in bzip).

 To mix things up a bit, I'm going to give two very small examples of
code that can be understood quickly, but studied diligently. Both are in
JavaScript, which I notice you mention specifically in another comment:

[1] Douglas Crockford's JSON parser. Worth a look because it is
excellently commented and is easily understandable
[https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json...](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.js)

[2] Bouncing Beholder. A game written in 1K of highly obfuscated code,
which the author expands upon here. Worth it because it teaches some
crazy optimisation techniques that are applicable to all programming,
but also includes plenty of javascript-specific trickery.

 I learned a lot from the Cocotron source:

[https://code.google.com/p/cocotron/source/browse](https://code.google.com/p/cocotron/source/browse)

It's a free cross-platform implementation of Apple's Cocoa, so there's a
lot of stuff there. But the project is well organized, and almost
everything is written in a minimalist oldschool Objective-C style.

I've looked at some other cross-platform frameworks, and they are often
hard to understand because they have been developed by a large group of
developers and include lots of complex optimizations and
platform-specific code paths. Cocotron is not as finely tuned as Apple's
CoreFoundation (for example), but much more readable.

 Erlang: Riak
[https://github.com/basho/riak](https://github.com/basho/riak) Riak is
actually a layering of a few different projects including Riak KV,
Yokozuna (Solr), Riak Core, etc. It was grown out of the Dynamo paper.

Haskell: Snap
[https://github.com/snapframework/snap](https://github.com/snapframework/snap)
Snap is another project built in layers (snap-server, io-streams,
snaplets, snap-core). The 1.0 release makes some pretty massive
structural changes behind the scenes changes with minimal breakage of
the public api and io-streams is a very nice api to work with.

JavaScript: Underscore.js
[http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html](http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html)
Underscore is a utility library that gives a nice overview of various
techniques in JS, such as how to handle equality, use of apply, ternary
operators, etc. Many functions have fallbacks to ECMAScript 5 native
functions.

 Reading the Underscore and Lodash sources was hugely beneficial to me.
If nothing else, it taught me how to reimplement what I could and drop
the dependencies in my libraries. I find the whole "vanilla js" meme a

writing a lot of modules used by others.

 Both are immensely awesome codebases, but the level-up is perhaps a bit
too steep. Going from delightful ANSI C (vanilla Lua) to a lot of
assembly + C (LuaJIT's interpreter) and runtime assembly generation (the

 Honestly, aside from learning to express a few extremely specific
patterns in your language of choice concisely and elegantly and
reminding yourself of the existence of certain libraries and utility
functions so you don't accidentally waste time reinventing them, I think
reading source code is a pretty useless exercise unless you also have a
detailed record of how that source code came to exist in its present
form. Until there is some revolutionary new tool for generating a
human-understandable narrated history of large-scale design decisions
from a source control history, your time will almost certainly be better
spent reading textbooks that incrementally develop a piece of software
over several chapters. Even that is cheating -- the authors know exactly
where they want to end up and they won't include all the missteps they
made when they first started writing similar programs. But it's still
loads better than the alternative. Just as sitting in a law school
library absorbing an encyclopedic knowledge of the law won't really
train you to make arguments that will fly in front of a judge, reading a
code base as a dead, unchanging document won't teach you what it is to
live in that code.

 I sort of agree, and sort of disagree.

It is possible to make misteps gracefully - that is, even when making
mistakes you can mitigate the problems by writing clean code and trying
to make it fit nice patterns you've already seen.

Sure, you can't copy directly, but you can get a feel for what is nice
and isn't by looking at lots of code that has reached it's goal, and
thus get an intuition for code smells.

Further, seeing how principles and patterns are used elsewhere helps
take abstract concepts and turn them into real examples - for me anyway
this is vital for my learning of anything.

 The most interesting things to read are those where a programmer has
done something cleverly, but this only needs to happen when your
language or libraries make it hard for you to begin with. Aside from
low-level performance intensive functions, the best code is not
interesting to read - it just reads like statements of fact.

and the main point of everything he writes is ideological warfare to
tear down Richard Stallman's work and promote his own career as a pundit

3.0 out of 5 stars Autohagiography with some programming tips, December
24, 2003 By A Customer

The writing style of this book tends to hurt the reading experience, as
Raymond trumpets his own minor achievments in the free software
community. The work feels like it needed one more rewrite before being
released to the public: some related sources Raymond hadn't yet read at
the time of writing, and some of his advice gets repetitive.

The exposition itself is not up to par with The Elements of Programming
Style. Raymond tries to give a list of programming rules or principles
to follow, but it reads more like a list of slogans that should be taken
as axioms. While The Elements of Programming Style itself had a list of
rules, the rules were well woven with each other, well defended, and
they were used as a means of conveying a larger story. In Raymond's
case, he relies upon the slogans in absence of such a story.

Thus, the book ends up more like a list of random unrelated tips. Some
very profound, like his writings on threads (which he acknowleges Mark
M. Miller for his help). Others are very shallow and pointless in a book
that supposes to call itself about "Art." Some of the pieces appear only
to function to attack Windows, and sometimes the information about
Windows is embarassingly inaccurate.

One final criticism is that Raymond does not understand object-oriented
programming very well and misses the point in several cases. You just
need to see the popularity of Python, Java, C\# (Mono), OO Perl and C++
in the Linux world to see that Raymond is off base calling OO a failed
experiment. In fact, with almost any matter of opinion in the book you
can feel Raymond's bias and be hit in the face with misinformation or
dull false dilemmas.

However, given this book's many flaws, I rate this 3 stars instead of 2
stars because it also has valuable information from the many
contributors, some of them Gods in the Unix world. These contributors
often even disagree with Raymond, or point out other interesting
tidbits. For these tips alone, it is worth checking out this book,
though I would not recommend you buy it.

To get the true Unix programming philosophy, I recommend Software Tools,
by Kernighan and Plauger. It's somewhat dated, and I recommend the
Ratfor version of it, but that single book has became very influencial
as I grow as a Unix programmer.

[...]

One of the problems with this book is the overly partisan tone it takes
- one gets the impression that absolutely nothing Microsoft has ever
done is of value, but the other major desktop PC OSes (Apple, Linux)
represent different forms of perfection. (At home, I run Mac OSX, RedHat
Linux and Windows, and have a reasonable sense of their relative
strengths and weaknesses.)

So, be warned: Art of Unix Programming paints a one sided picture. The
author is a well-known figure in the open source community, one of its
fiercest advocates, and one of Microsoft's most vocal critics, so it
might seem to strange to wish for less anti-Microsoft spin from this
source. After all, the Raymond brand certainly carries with it an
obligatory expectation of Windows-bashing, doesn't it?

One of the only Windows design decision which Raymond doesn't condemn is
the (now discontinued) .ini file format. Even the thorough-going support
for object-orientation in Windows is given short-shrift: after
explaining the many horrors of object-oriented programming (according to
Raymond), Unix-programmers are praised as "tend[ing] to share an
instinctive sense of these problems." This section ([...]) is
particularly illustrative of the one-sided approach that Raymond takes.

[...]

His comments about the Windows registry were a bit distressing, though
-- not because they're negative, which I consider fine. Rather, it was
obvious he'd never used it (comments like "there's no API for it") and
it was also clear that he hadn't even bothered to research why it
existed and what problems it was intended to solve. The comments were
typical of what I'd expect of a Slashdot troll, but not of a bright,
respectable person like ESR. I've programmed on both platforms
extensively and only comment on what I have first-hand experience and
knowledge of; I'd expect him to do the no less, especially as an author.

It was also curious that several times he implied unit testing == XP ==
agile software development. For as tuned in as he seems to be to
methodolgy work, missing the forest for a single leaf is a bit
embarrassing.

[...]

Hate to be the one to burst the proverbial bubble..., March 13, 2004 By
Bill Joy (Hamburg, DE)

...but ESR's theory and ideology is rediculously flawed with
misappropriated valuations. This is, yet another advocacy campaign for
gnu/Linux, mixed in with a UNIX context. Given the purpose of the book,
it's a fair assessment to label the burdening bias as filler and
firewood: filler for those who really just wanted an explanation of the
single-purpose, POSIX illustrated, hows and whys of UNIX programming
philosophy; and firewood for those who tend to buy into slanderous hype
at the whim of suggestion.

Questions: What is the title of the book? What programmatic philosophies
are portrayed? How many unices are open source? Of those, how many
subscribe to the same opensource mentality as gnu/Linux? Answer: zilch.
Question: Then what is the relevance of such topics to the objectives of
the book, as depicted in the title? Answer: fudd-ala-mode.

Aside from these intertwined distractions, and a severe Napoleonic
complex against anything new or different, ESR does adequately represent
the real purpose of the book, and in those efforts place value in the
read.

an interesting and often annoying read..., June 1, 2004 By A Customer

I suppose any book containing so many interesting quotes from so many
UNIX luminaries cannot be overlooked. (I wonder if any of them would
have co-authored this) It also happens to contain a great many topics
that are well-worth writing about; My only wish is that someone less in
awe with the contents of his own field of vision, and with greater depth
and objectivity (not to mention humility) had the opportunity to write
this book.

Quality of discussion is varied as expected; Raymond is not quite the
UNIX expert he thinks he is. In places, Raymond's tone encourages one to
throw the book at the nearest wall and go out just to get some fresh
air; He is condescending, hectoring, lecturing, and sometimes just
misleading. Alas, I will still recommend it as worth reading (check your
local library) with a nice grain of salt; just enough friction for
thought is provided in this edition.

programming book without any code, May 11, 2013 By davez (LA, CA, United
States)

If you expect to see any code, you'll be disappointed. The author gives
ample examples, but mostly preaching the Unix philosophy or religion, at
many times repeating the similar points. 500 pages are a little long for
a book of this kind. Having read other Unix books, I've heard many of
the stories retold here, but still learned a few new things. It
reenforces many notions of Unix.

This is a book that I would recommend to someone new to Unix, but it is
not a book that I would keep. After 10 years, the computing landscape
has changed with the rise of the mobile computing and cloud computing;
the Unix has evolved to support smart phones and tablets, in which the
user interface has become essential.

 Rather disturbing, yet perfectly typical.

One good example of the problem with his "technical" works and his lack
of actual experience with the things he likes to talk about so much, is
that he makes and promotes outrageously incorrect claims like:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus's\_Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus's_Law)

"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."

When in fact:

Given ANY number of eye, "all" bugs are NOT shallow.

Some bugs are NEVER "shallow".

And only a FEW eyes are qualified to see some bugs, while MANY eyes are
totally unqualified, including his own:

His mouth is certainly not qualified to make sweeping generalizations
about "all" bugs, given his lack of experience as a programmer, and his
spectacular public failure at auditing code in his pathetic attempt to
discredit the now-exonerated scientists whose code predicted global
warming (described below).

Neither "enough eyeballs" nor "the right eyeballs" are a GIVEN, even for
open source software.

"Not enough eyeballs" (or "ZERO eyeballs" as he loves to claim) are NOT
a GIVEN for proprietary software, because you can license much
proprietary source code, and some proprietary source code is available
for you to read and audit for free, under licenses like Microsoft's
"Shared Source" license.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared\_source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_source)

And qualified eye balls are NOT FREE, and usually very busy being well
paid to look at much more interesting things than poorly written buggy
code like OpenSSL. I doubt that Eric Raymond has contributed any of the
profits from his books or VA Linux stocks to Theo De Raadt or anyone
else who actually takes the long time and tedious effort to actually
audit code.

Wikipedia points out:

\>In Facts and Fallacies about Software Engineering, Robert Glass refers
to the law as a "mantra" of the open source movement, but calls it a
fallacy due to the lack of supporting evidence and because research has
indicated that the rate at which additional bugs are uncovered does not
scale linearly with the number of reviewers; rather, there is a small
maximum number of useful reviewers, between two and four, and additional
reviewers above this number uncover bugs at a much lower rate. While
closed-source practitioners also promote stringent, independent code
analysis during a software project's development, they focus on in-depth
review by a few and not primarily the number of "eyeballs".

And then there's the fact that Eric Raymond had the nerve to name and
blame the "law" on Linus instead of taking "credit" for it himself.

And of course he also has the nerve to attempt to defend his "law",
after we've just gone through three HUGE security holes in open source
software that would have been discovered long ago, if only "Linus's Law"
were true. On his blog, he constructs a straw man argument that
"proprietary software is worse than open source software", which does
not in any way support his claim about "all bugs being shallow".

[http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5665](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5665)

Nor does he address many of the valid points that people raise, in the
wikipedia article itself I just quoted, or that people raised in
response to his blog posting.

To quote Theo De Raadt: “My favorite part of the “many eyes” argument is
how few bugs were found by the two eyes of Eric (the originator of the
statement). All the many eyes are apparently attached to a lot of hands
that type lots of words about many eyes, and never actually audit code.”

The little experience Raymond DOES have auditing code has been a total
fiasco and embarrassing failure, since his understanding of the code was
incompetent and deeply tainted by his preconceived political ideology
and conspiracy theories about global warming, which was his only
motivation for auditing the code in the first place. His sole quest was
to discredit the scientists who warned about global warming. The code he
found and highlighted was actually COMMENTED OUT, and he never addressed
the fact that the scientists were vindicated.

[http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Eric\_S.\_Raymond](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond)

\>During the Climategate fiasco, Raymond's ability to read other
peoples' source code (or at least his honesty about it) was called into
question when he was caught quote-mining analysis software written by
the CRU researchers, presenting a commented-out section of source code
used for analyzing counterfactuals as evidence of deliberate data
manipulation. When confronted with the fact that scientists as a general
rule are scrupulously honest, Raymond claimed it was a case of an "error
cascade," a concept that makes sense in computer science and other
places where all data goes through a single potential failure point, but
in areas where outside data and multiple lines of evidence are used for
verification, doesn't entirely make sense. (He was curiously silent when
all the researchers involved were exonerated of scientific misconduct.)

Eric Raymond's standard technique is to stonewall and ignore valid
criticism, while viciously attacking his critics. You can see that
behavior consistently applied in most of his blog postings, comments,
public statements and publications.

An archetypical example is his mean spirited name-calling defense of
Russell Nelson, who was acting as President of the Open Source
Initiative, a position that Raymond had just been kicked out of because
his divisive in-fighting and life-long jihad against Richard Stallman
was embarrassing them and damaging their reputation -- Russell was his
replacement: OOPS!

After having been appointed President, Russell Nelson posted a blog
entry entitled "Blacks are lazy", which of COURSE drew a lot of
criticism, because it was obvious race baiting, and riddled with logical
fallacies and racist bigoted presumptions. Russell expressed that it was
"poor writing" and withdrew the blog posting, and resigned his position
as President of the Open Source Initiative.

The original blog posting can be seen in the comments section of his
wikipedia page, so you can draw your own conclusions:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Russ\_Nelson\#Blacks\_are\_la...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Russ_Nelson#Blacks_are_lazy)

Russell agreed with his critics that his blog posting was wrong --
although as to HOW wrong, he still disagrees with most critics, and he's
generalized his argument to "everyone is lazy" and has characterized the
criticism of him as "slander":

[http://blog.russnelson.com/economics/blacks-are-lazy.html](http://blog.russnelson.com/economics/blacks-are-lazy.html)

So, now that I've explained the background, I will demonstrate what I
mean by how Eric Raymond typically constructs his arguments to support
his political agenda, by ignoring valid criticism and turning it around
on the critic by calling people names:

Even though Russell agreed the article was badly written, took it down,
and voluntarily resigned, Eric demanded that OSI not only SUPPORT
Russell, but waste their precious money, time, energy and reputation
FIGHTING a BATTLE based on his own extreme right-wing libertarian
"principles" against Russell's critics (who he called "FOOLS" and
"THUGS"), which had NOTHING at all to do with open source software:

[http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/New-OSI-Presi...](http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/New-OSI-President-Steps-Down/#sthash.EJtgGdxJ.dpuf)

“The people who knew Russ as a Quaker, a pacifist and a gentleman, and
no racist, but nevertheless pressured OSI to do the responsible thing
and fire him in order to avoid political damage should be equally
ashamed,” Raymond said. “Abetting somebody elses witch hunt is no less
disgusting than starting your own.”

"Personally, I wanted to fight this on principle," Raymond said. "Russ
resigned the presidency rather than get OSI into that fight, and the
board quite properly respected his wishes in the matter. That sacrifice
makes me angrier at the fools and thugs who pulled him down."

Since both Eric Raymond and Russell Nelson lost their leadership
positions as President of the Open Source Initiative because of their
bigoted, racist, divisive and very public beliefs, you can guess which
side of the Brendan Eich controversy they came down on:

"My first thought on hearing of the resignation of Brendan Eich as CEO
of Mozilla: Congratulations, gay activists. You have become the bullies
you hate.﻿" -Eric Raymond

And this from the same self avowed "cheerful gun nut" who threatened
Bruce Perens:

[https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1999/04/msg00197.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1999/04/msg00197.html)

"Damn straight I took it personally. And if you ever again behave like
that kind of disruptive asshole in public, insult me, and jeopardize the
interests of our entire tribe, I'll take it just as personally -- and I
will find a way to make you regret it. Watch your step."

Bruce Perens Dead
[http://geekz.co.uk/lovesraymond/archive/bruce-perens-dead](http://geekz.co.uk/lovesraymond/archive/bruce-perens-dead)

Anyway, back to the criticism of TAoUP and Raymond's other technical
claims to fame and self aggrandizing Autohagiography:

Everything he writes is deeply tainted with his one-sided partisan
ideology and narcissistic self promotion, which is not just limited to
Microsoft bashing, but to extreme right wing libertarian politics and
guns. You can see that by the changes he made to the "Hacker's
Dictionary", and you can see that in everything else he writes.

I've posted some typical reviews of the book in the other message.

 Well thank you for taking the time to give critique. I was hoping to
return to the book at some point and work through the suggested readings
in more detail. I will definitely approach it with more caution a second
time round and even more so when recommending it to others.

(that last one is about the tantrum I linked to above)

I've known Eric Raymond and Richard Stallman since the 80's, and I can
confirm that Raymond has always been that way, isn't anything like the
"hacker" he claims to be, and instead of writing or auditing code, he
has made his career by self aggrandizing himself and tearing down
Richard Stallman, who is and will always be a much better and more
successful person than he is.

But the he got even crazier, and went off the deep end after 9/11.

His "many eyes" law that he shamelessly promotes has given many people
and organizations a false sense of security in open source software, and
that's led to many huge commercial corporations taking the free stuff
without contributing any money or time back, and building all kinds of
critical internet infrastructure on top of software like OpenSSL. And
you know what that led to.

When he claimed that the mean old gays were bullying poor Brendan Eich,
and his friend Russell Nelson took up and defended his argument, it made
me recognize a pattern that explains their motivation very well:

Eric Raymond and Russell Nelson and Brendan Eich all served as the head
of major free open source software companies: Eric Raymond was the first
president of the Open Source Initiative, Russell Nelson was the second
taking over when he resigned, and then resigned himself shortly
thereafter, and Brendan Eich was CEO of Mozilla.

All three of them made bigoted statements and performed bigoted actions,
and as a consequence of their own speech and actions, and of their high
visibility leadership positions of free open source companies, they each
felt compelled to resign from their jobs, and now feel very sorry for
themselves because of how other people reacted, not because of how they
acted.

It's disgusting how Eric and Russell are now whining about the mean
"intolerant gay bullies" who didn't respect Brendan's right to be
intolerant of oppressed minorities. They're just projecting from their
own experiences as ousted bigots. The mean old community just couldn't
tolerate their bigoted divisive beliefs which were embarrassing and
damaging the free open source software movement.

Russell Nelson goes as far as to disagree with Karl Popper and other
philosophers about The Paradox of Tolerance, which states that it's
justified to be intolerant of tolerance:
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox\_of\_tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance)
-- Russell argues that it's "baby thinking" to "tolerate everything but
intolerance":
[http://blog.russnelson.com/politics/tolerating-intolerance.h...](http://blog.russnelson.com/politics/tolerating-intolerance.html)

That's their standard operating procedure, of ignoring criticism and
calling their critics names instead of responding with logical
arguments. So Karl Popper is a baby thinker in Russell Nelson's mind.

So naturally Raymond and Nelson both feel sorry for Eich. They're birds
of a feather, cut from the same cloth: they all lay down with the same
dogs, and wake up with the same fleas.

So what does it say about Eich that two of his most sympathetic and
vocal defenders were also kicked out of their leadership positions in a
Free Open Source Software company, because of divisiveness and bigotry,
just like he was?

Eric Raymond and Russell Nelson are far beyond redemption. And Brendan
Eich finally put himself into the same boat as they are, and it's all
his own damn fault, so of course those guys are his biggest advocates
and defenders, and they all deserve each other.

And now Eich's legacy is not just tarnished by his donation to support
Proposition 8, but by the fact that two of the most notorious douchebag
in the free open source software community have come out of the woodwork
screeching a full throated defense of him.

I think it's wonderful that the community refused to be led or fooled by
people like them, who would pay money to make TV commercials demonizing
gays and destroying sex marriages, or race bait and call the victims of
their own bigotry bullies for standing up for themselves and exercising
their right to free speech.

 I learned a huge amount about how real operating systems are put
together and the compromises that get made by reading the V6 Unix source
via John Lions Commentaries (yes...I had a photocopied copy). Made
exploring the BSD 4.2 and 4.3 source trees (another worthwhile exercise)
much easier. I suppose if I was starting out today and not in 1985 I'd
look at xv6 or Minix.

 I have some experience with Yii and coming from Django I'm not

why not study something Symphony which, arguably, achieves more and is

 Agreed but if function follows form then Yii is somewhat lacking. Maybe
I'm just biased because when I was in a tight spot digging through the
source and docs didn't get me where I wanted to be.

 Agreed.

Here is a link to cpython 2.7 libraries:
[http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/70274d53c1dd/Lib](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/70274d53c1dd/Lib)

Those that are implemented in C are in the "Modules" folder from the top
level.

I think you [OP] will get the most benefit from reading libraries that
you use often because it will give you some direction.

If there are 3rd party libraries you use heavily those will be
interesting too.

It is very very difficult to just pick up megabytes of code and start
reading them and find it useful. You will be able to pick up style and
conventions but not really high-level engineering decisions.

My suggestion is to take software that you use regularly and run it
through a debugger. Since you use it you know the problem domain. And
with the debugger the code you're reading gets real context. I've done
this with Git for example.

And also look at the design documents for big OSS projects.

 Slight tangent to your question, but one thing I have noticed recently
is that having to deal with really crap code inspires me to do my own
better.

I inherited a colleagues work after she left, and it was horrible. But I
thought about why it was horrible, and how to make it better. *What
would it look like if it was done well?*

Even with my own code, if I look at something I did 6 months ago, and it
doesn't make sense straight away, the it can usually be improved.

be interesting to hear some perspectives.

Do you generate tags and hop around functions as you discover them? Do
you do a high level overview of the important bits first, and then dive
in later? I am sure it is different for everyone, but would still be
interested to read about others approaches.

I've had this idea for awhile about bringing up a project in a
methodical way in its source control history, and adding new features in
a similar manner, so that it would be easier to introduce a codebase to
those starting out in it. The problem with lots of large codebases is
that as time goes on, configuration details or special cases are added
on that obscure the meat of the program. If it were trivial to see the
early version, and its evolution, it would be easy to pick out the
mental model of what the code actually does.

 Also can someone suggest what is the best way to approach code reading?
When I open a library in Python, I am not sure where to start reading,
just a bunch of files. Should I randomly pick one file and start reading
from there? Is there any common strategy?

 I don't get much out of simply reading code. I have to get my hands in
there and see how it works.

I load it into a repl and play around. See how changing little things
effects tests. I add print statements to give a narrative. I draw
diagrams of the code flow, especially startup, shutdown and sometimes
error/exception handling.

 Reference based compression! We create a set of reference sequences and
simply record the start location of each identified subsequence - of
course this relies on the assumption we can correctly recognise all
genes and their variants... ahem.

 You mean reference to another copy of the genome?

Or you mean trying to find long repeat sequences that are slightly
mutated in a way that is low-entropy?

 The original source code to Zork in MDL. It doesn't matter if you don't
know MDL. It's such beautiful code that it just explains itself to you.
And if you've played Zork, it's like being invited to explore the
underground backstage areas of Disneyland.

 I highly recommend checking out
[http://voxeljs.com](http://voxeljs.com) for some beautifully factored
JavaScript npm packages, that implement a lot of Minecraft and more in
the browser.

Max Ogden's talk (the first video on that page, also here:
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gM3xMObEz4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gM3xMObEz4)
) about how voxeljs and browserify work is inspirational, and his
energy, motivation, deep understanding and skill, thirst for learning,
reading other people's code, building on top of it, and sharing what he
built and learned, is extremely contagious!

You may want to pause the video frequently and take notes -- there is so
much great information in there, and he covers a hell of a lot of
amazing stuff.

And the source code is really nicely broken up into lots of little npm
modules that you can plug together to make all kinds of cool stuff.

This stuff is a great fun starting point for teenagers or students to
learn how to program and create their own games and web applications, or
master programmers to learn the node.js / npm ecosystem and idioms.
There are some great ways for new and non-programmers to get into it.

He says "Everyday I work on it I get more motivated to work on it" --
and you will too!

What you will be benefitting from by watching his video and reading his
code, is the fact that he actually did a survey of a HUGE amount of
code, and took the best, read it, learned from it, rewrote it, and built
on top of it.

"So many people have written voxel stuff, that I should just copy them."
He used github search, and searched for minecraft, filtered by
javascript, and went through ALL 23 PAGES of projects! He cloned ALL the
repos he found, and read the ones that seemed promising, cloned them,
got them running, understood how they worked.

A lot of them were the classic genius programmer projects, really
impressive visually, super hard to understand, a giant lib folder with
50 files, everybody writing their own 3d engine.

Then he found out about three.js, and learned that, and combined all the
stuff he had seen on top of it, including a PhD project in computational
geometry that showed how to efficiently implement minecraft with
three.js, for removing interior faces, etc.

So he learned from and built on top of all that great stuff, and made
voxel.js and an insane amount of demos. Now the community has written a
whole bunch of nice modular node.js npm modules and demos, that
browserify can combine them together into a package that runs in the
browser.

My only trivial beef with it is that their style guide says not to use
trailing semicolons! That makes emacs very irritated and it breaks out
in a rash.

But other than that, the code is very clean and modular and
comprehensible, and opened my mind to a lot of stuff that I didn't
realize was possible.
