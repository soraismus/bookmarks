Browserify and the Universal Module Definition
==============================================

*Thu Jun 13 2013*

**

[How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Browserify](#how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-browserify)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Defining a module is really simple but like all simple things; none of
us can agree on just one. While this is generally true for all
communities it is especially erratic in the javascript community. This
is not really javascript's fault though. It's not easy being an
extremely flexible, loosely interpreted language available on just about
every platform.

The current actively used module definitions are:

### Global Variables

    // MyDependency is in your global scope
    var MyModule = function() {};

### CommonJS

    var MyDependency = require('my-dependency');
    module.exports = function() {};

### AMD

    define(['my-dependency'], function(MyDependency) {
      return function() {};
    });

[Universal Access](#universal-access)
-------------------------------------

Typically you want your module to be easily consumed by the users of all
of these module definitions. So the prudent module author will opt for
the Universal Module Definition:

    (function (root, factory) {
      if (typeof exports === 'object') {
        // CommonJS
        module.exports = factory(require('b'));
      } else if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {
        // AMD
        define(['b'], function (b) {
          return (root.returnExportsGlobal = factory(b));
        });
      } else {
        // Global Variables
        root.returnExportsGlobal = factory(root.b);
      }
    }(this, function (b) {
      // Your actual module
      return {};
    }));

WAT. Yes that works and you're an awesome module author for taking that
extra step in making your module universal. But let's be honest. That is
a mess. I don't want to include that in all of my modules.

The truth is most authors won't configure UMD in all their modules or if
they do; they likely will do it wrong rendering the a definition
ineffective or just plain broken.

[ES6 to the Rescue?](#es6-to-the-rescue)
----------------------------------------

Harmony is on horizon and it includes a module definition:

    import { MyDependency } from 'my-dependency';
    export function mymodule() {}

Hooray! We're done... or are we? This may seem like the holy grail but
it has a few problems:

### It Technically Doesn't Exist Yet

ES6 isn't here yet so this definition isn't an option at the moment. It
will be awhile before this option is available in Node.js and the
browsers. Even longer until you can safely use it universally (think
about IE).

### Will *Everyone* Use It?

Just because javascript includes a module definition doesn't mean
everyone will use it. Some of the more prominent members of the
javascript community have already spoken out against it. Throw in the
authors who don't know about it and we might have just yet another
module definition.

### Can UMD Detect It?

During the transition to ES6 modules, what will UMD look like? Can it
natively detect if a module is using the `export` keyword? I don't think
it can (please correct me if I'm wrong). You could build a shim for it
but ultimately you're just creating yet another module definition.

[The Solution](#the-solution)
-----------------------------

Stop worrying and use a build tool. Pick whatever module definition you
like. Then transform the modules as you build.

### What About Those Who Don't Want to Use a Build Tool?

Too bad for them. Think about the audience you're catering to. They are
copying and pasting your module into files and adding a bunch of script
tags to their page. Those users should have no problem also modifying
your module to fit their needs. If anything by not catering to that use
case you're doing them a favor by pushing them to a better workflow.

[](#a-hrefhttpbrowserifyorgbrowserifya)[Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Browserify](http://browserify.org/) is a great build tool for this.
Through transforms it enables you to consume any module.

Install browserify with: `npm install browserify -g`

### CommonJS

Browserify works natively with the CommonJS module definition:

    browserify main.js -o bundle.js

which will produce a `bundle.js` file.

It can be included on your page with:

    <script src="bundle.js"></script>

### AMD

Browserify can consume AMD modules with
[deamdify](https://npmjs.org/package/deamdify):

    npm install deamdify
    browserify -t deamdify main.js -o bundle.js

### Global Variables

Browserify can consume globals as well with
[deglobalify](https://npmjs.org/package/deglobalify):

    npm install deglobalify
    browserify -t deglobalify main.js -o bundle.js

### ES6

What about harmony? Yep! Use [es6ify](https://npmjs.org/package/es6ify):

    npm install es6ify
    browserify -t es6ify main.js -o bundle.js

[Browserify Universally](#browserify-universally)
-------------------------------------------------

You can use multiple transforms in one swoop and have universal module
access:

    npm install deamdify es6ify deglobalify
    browserify -t deamdify -t es6ify -t deglobalify main.js -o bundle.js

[NOT USING npm?](#not-using-npm)
--------------------------------

We've got a transform for that:
[decomponentify](https://npmjs.org/package/decomponentify) and
[debowerify](https://npmjs.org/package/debowerify).

[Integration with Grunt](#integration-with-grunt)
-------------------------------------------------

You can use transforms with
[grunt-browserify](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-browserify) to
integrate into your Grunt workflow as well:

    npm install grunt-browserify grunt deamdify deglobalify \
    debowerify decomponentify --save-dev

In your `Gruntfile.js`:

    grunt.initConfig({
      browserify: {
        all: {
          src: 'main.js',
          dest: 'bundle.js',
          options: {
            transform: ['debowerify', 'decomponentify', 'deamdify', 'deglobalify'],
          },
        },
      },
    });
    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-browserify');

Now I can consume any package from `npm`, `bower`, `component` or
globally defined script simply by typing: `grunt browserify`.

[Conclusion](#conclusion)
-------------------------

I seriously doubt all of us will ever agree and use a single module
definition.

So stop worrying and love the browserify.
