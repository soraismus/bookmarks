The Limitations of DNS A-Records

DNS A-records can be used to configure zone apex domains (also called
bare, naked, or root domains). These records have serious availability
implications when used in environments such as on-premise data-centers,
cloud infrastructure services, and platforms like Heroku.

For maximum scalability and resiliency applications should avoid using
DNS A-records and instead [use a DNS provider that supports CNAME
functionality at the apex, or use sub-domains
exclusively](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains#root-domain).

Limitations
-----------

DNS A-records require that an IP address be hard-coded into your
application’s DNS configuration. This prevents your infrastructure
provider from assigning your app a new IP address on your behalf when
adverse conditions arise and can have a serious impact to your app’s
uptime.

A CNAME record does not require hard-coded IP addresses and allows
Heroku to manage the set of IPs associated with your domain. However,
CNAME records are not available at the zone apex and can’t be used to
configure root domains.

Supported apex domain configurations
------------------------------------

There are two approaches available to serve traffic from the root domain
while preserving the ability of your provider to manage your apps' IP
addresses: using a DNS provider that supports CNAME-like functionality
at the apex, and using subdomain redirection.

Both approaches are discussed in the custom domains article: [Configure
an apex domain for your
app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains#root-domain)

SSL
---

Traffic routed over SSL behaves, at the DNS level, identical to
unencrypted traffic and suffers from the same naked domain limitations.

However, applications requiring SSL encryption should use the
ALIAS/ANAME configuration on the root domain. Subdomain redirection will
cause a browser error when the root domain is requested over SSL (i.e.
`https://example.com`).
