What's On Your Utility Belt?
============================

\
 Like any self-respecting geek, I'm mostly an [indoor
enthusiast](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/geek-diet-and-exercise-programs.html).
\

\
 But on those unfortunate occasions when I am compelled -- for reasons
entirely beyond my control -- to leave the house, I do so fully armed
with my crucial **utility belt items**. Yes, you heard me, I transform
from the geeky Bruce Wayne *to the gosh-darned Batman!* \

\

\

\
 At least, that's how I like to think of it. \

\
 I've been talking about this [every-day carry
stuff](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/01/whats-on-your-keychain-2008-edition.html)
for
[quite](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/06/whats-on-your-keychain-in-2006.html)
a
[while](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/03/whats-on-your-keychain.html)
now. The 2010 edition of **my personal utility belt** is mostly subtle
tweaks, but I daresay it's the best one yet. \

\

\

\
 The art of [every-day
carry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_day_carry) must go on. What
you see here is the contents of my pocket: \

1.  **[Patriot 32 GB USB flash
    drive](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001IWOQXQ/codihorr-20)**\
    \
     Now you can have a whole freakin' hard drive worth of files in your
    pocket. Just in case, you know, you have an emergency need to
    [upload a virus to an alien
    mothership](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(film)),
    or something. Beware the many cheap, slow USB flash drives out
    there; this one is a real gem. It's inexpensive, and per my
    measurements, about as fast as they get. This is important because
    the larger the flash drive, [the more important speed
    becomes](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/06/large-usb-flash-drive-performance.html).
    Hard to believe I've gone from carrying a 512 megabyte flash drive
    in 2005 to a 32 *gigabyte* flashdrive in 2010.\
    \
2.  **[Leatherman Squirt
    P4](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007UQ1CO/codihorr-20)**\
    \
     Ounce for ounce, nothing beats the utility of the Leatherman
    Squirt. This time I opted for the plier (P) version instead of the
    scissors (S), and after seeing how much more generally useful the
    pliers are, I am now a little ashamed to admit I ever carried the
    wussy scissors version. Pliers all the way, baby. And yes, that is a
    [Pulp Fiction](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/) joke you see on
    it. \
    \
3.  **[Fenix mini AAA LED flashlight model
    LD01R2](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002YKL2ZQ/codihorr-20)**\
    \
     Since I've been carrying them in 2005, the average LED flashlight
    has gone from bright, to very bright, to amazingly bright, to
    *ridiculously blinding laser-like bright*. It's scary how bright
    these fancy milled aluminum AAA LED flashlights get now. What I like
    about this one is that it lets you trade off stupid-brightness for
    something practical, like greater runtime: you can twist the top to
    switch levels: 9 Lumens for 11 hours, 28 Lumens for 3.5 hours, or 85
    Lumens for 1 hour.\
    \
4.  **[Small Nite Ize
    s-biner](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002MD01KC/codihorr-20)**\
    \
     These little nite-ize carabiners are awesome for quick attachment
    and detachment of your EDC items, but I'll warn you: resist the urge
    to put everything you carry on a carabiner, because if you do, the
    weight and "jangliness" goes up a lot -- and [this way lies
    madness](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0037GZZCC/codihorr-20).
    Consider how many items you actually *remove* from your keychain
    regularly. For me, the only item I frequently removed to work with
    was the Squirt, so that's the only one I put on a carabiner.

\
 Rest assured, everything here is carefully selected with the
appropriate levels of monomaniacal attention to detail. For this weight
and size, I don't think you can do better. (And don't think I've
forgotten about [optimizing my
wallet](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/04/optimizing-your-wallet.html),
either. Oh no. Quite the contrary.) \

\
 However, I have to add a special category this year for the other
must-have EDC utility belt item: the smartphone. **What self-respecting
superhero would leave the house these days without their smartphone?**
I'm not religious about it, but [I use and rather like the iPhone
4](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/06/the-iphone-software-revolution.html),
and I'm continually amazed how many things it does that I used to carry
separate items for: \

-   cell phone (obviously)
-   "Nintendo DSwhatever" for portable gaming
-   GPS
-   point and shoot digital camera
-   near-desktop quality mobile web browser and email client
-   mp3 player with speakers
-   audio and hi-def video recorder
-   DVD player
-   ebook reader
-   watch, alarm
-   emergency flashlight (via front facing LED flash control)
-   scanner
-   level and ruler

\
 Smartphones really are [the ultimate
gadget](http://gadgets.stackexchange.com/). The list of functions is
already enormous, and I'm sure I'm leaving out a few other things that
you can do with a modern smartphone. \

\
 In a pinch, I *could* conceivably drop the AAA LED flashlight and the
USB flash drive from my EDC kit and substitute the smartphone. Not
exactly, mind you, but it's getting closer every year. At this rate,
Apple could introduce a flip-out blade on the iPhone 7 and reduce my
entire EDC kit to one item. \

\
 Anyway, that's what's on my utility belt in 2010. What's on yours? \
