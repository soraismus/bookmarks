Robots have loomed over the future of labor for decades—at least since
robotic arms started replacing auto workers on the assembly line in the
early 1960s. Optimists say that more robots will lead to greater
productivity and economic growth, while pessimists complain that huge
swaths of the labor force will see their employment options automated
out of existence.

Each has a point, but there’s another way to look at this seemingly
inevitable trend. What if both are right? As robots start doing more and
more of the work humans used to do, and doing it so much more
efficiently than we ever did, what if the need for jobs disappears
altogether? What if the robots end up producing more than enough of
everything that everyone needs?

The [redefinition of work
itself](http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/6/#it-will-free-us-from-the-industrial-age-notion-of-what-a-job-is)
is one of the most intriguing possibilities imagined in a recent [Pew
Research report](http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/)
on the future of robots and jobs. Certainly, the prospect of a
robot-powered, post-scarcity future of mandatory mass leisure feels like
a far-off scenario, and an edge case even then. In the present, ensuring
that everyone has enough often seems harder for humans to accomplish
than producing enough in the first place. But assuming a future that
looks more like *Star Trek* than *Blade Runner*, a lot of people could
end up with a lot more time on their hands. In that case, robots won’t
just be taking our jobs; they’ll be forcing us to confront a major
existential dilemma: if we didn’t have to work anymore, what would we
do?

The answer is both a quantitative and qualitative exercise in defining
what makes human intelligence distinct from the artificial kind, a
definition that seems to keep getting narrower. And in the end, we might
figure out that a job-free roboticized future is even scarier than it
sounds.

### Humanity as a Service

One prevailing answer kind of dodges the question, but it also seems
like one of the most plausible outcomes. Maybe many jobs can’t be
automated in the first place. Several respondents canvassed by Pew
believe that the need for human labor will persist because so many of
our basic human qualities are hard to code. “Truth be told, computers
are not very smart. All they are is giant calculators,” game designer
and author Celia Pearce told Pew. “They can do things that require
logic, but logic is only one part of the human mind.”

Humans will continue to be useful workers, the argument goes, because of
things like empathy, creativity, judgment, and critical thinking.
Consider the all-too-common experience of calling customer service reps
whose employers force them to follow a script—a kind of
pseudo-automation. When made to follow a decision tree the way a
computer would, all four of those qualities are sucked out of the
interaction—no opportunity to exercise creativity, empathy, judgment, or
critical thinking—and the service provided tends to stink.

“Detecting complaints is an AI problem. Sending the complaints to the
correct customer service entity is an AI problem,” said one unnamed Pew
respondent described as a university professor and researcher. “But
customer service itself is a human problem.”

Overall, the kinds of jobs that respondents predicted humans would still
be needed to do involved interactions with other people. Healthcare,
education, and caring for the elderly and children were all seen as
occupations that would still require a human touch. “Those areas in
which human compassion is important will be less changed than those
where compassion is less or not important,” said Herb Lin, chief
scientist on the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board at the
National Academies of Science.

Future job options may even extend beyond the caring professions to
include work that the fluid integration of body and mind still make it
most efficient for humans to perform. In a piece looking at the “instant
gratification” economy of same-day delivery, San Francisco UPS driver
Rafael Monterrosa tells *Recode* [he’s not
worried](http://recode.net/2014/08/05/it-takes-a-new-kind-of-worker-to-make-instant-happen/)
about a self-driving car taking his place. “As far as delivery goes, you
still need someone to carry something up the stairs.”

### No Job Required

Still, as industries from manufacturing to transportation to
[journalism](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/07/automated_insights_to_write_ap_earnings_reports_why_robots_can_t_take_journalists.html)
are overtaken by artificial intelligence, the sheer number of new
openings in more human service-related industries may not keep up with
the number of other jobs lost. That could be leave many, many people out
of work. But it could also end up changing our economy in enormous ways.

Traditionally, increased productivity correlates with economic growth
*and* job growth, since human labor has historically driven production.
A robot workforce, however, can drive productivity and growth on its
own, eliminating jobs in the process. That might mean the whole paradigm
of exchanging labor for pay starts to break down. “If we persist in the
view that the dividends from robots’ increased productivity should
accrue to robot owners, we’ll definitely come to a future where there
aren’t enough owners of robots to buy all the things that robots make,”
[Cory Doctorow
wrote](http://boingboing.net/2014/07/23/when-all-the-jobs-belong-to-ro.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#more-320259)
in a recent *Boing Boing* post.

Doctorow suggests the possibility that robot-driven abundance could
undermine the need for markets as we know them. “Property rights may be
a way of allocating resources when there aren’t enough of them to go
around, but when automation replaces labor altogether and there’s lots
of everything, do we still need it?” Assuming a post-scarcity system of
distribution evolves to peacefully and fairly share the fruits of
robot-driven post-scarcity production, jobs as we know them might not
just become unnecessary—they might stop making sense altogether.

The idea that robots could make employment itself optional may sound
fantastic. No more work! But the end result could be more, not less
angst. We’d still have to find our place among the robots, except this
time without work as a guidepost for defining a sense of purpose. By
eliminating the need for people to work, robots would free us up to
focus on what really makes us human. The scariest possibility of all is
that only then do we figure out what really makes us human is work.
