Cryptocontracts Will Turn Law Into a Programming Language
=========================================================

A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a post with 10 things that amazed me
about bitcoin
([here](http://thoughtinfection.com/2014/02/09/on-the-blockchain-nobody-knows-youre-a-fridge-and-9-other-amazing-things-about-bitcoin/)).
I just can’t stop thinking about the idea that I brought up in the final
point of that post, specifically that bitcoin could enable the
development of self-enforcing contracts. It is just such a huge game
changer that a program could hold wealth in a way that is inaccessible
to anyone, and then distribute said wealth based on defined and agreed
mathematical rules.

One example I have been thinking about is that I could create a contract
to support this blog, whereby readers could donate their support to the
contract but I would only get paid out a certain amount (or perhaps a
percentage of the total pool) for every post I make. In this way, donors
would be able to give their support but also would have some form of
assurances that they would continue to receive content for their
donation. Additional complexity could also be used to enhance the
effectiveness of such contracts; things like such as word requirements,
per reader bonuses, cost recovery clauses, an expiry dates when unused
money should to be returned to a donor etc.

While applying this to a blog is a rather mundane example, I can imagine
this could be exactly how donation driven projects will be run in the
future (such as charities, scientific foundations, maybe even
governments). \

All of this got me thinking that this kind of programmatic wealth
distribution is exactly what contracts already do. A lawyer draws up a
piece of paper that says I am going to do A, so you will pay me B. What
self-enforcing contracts change is that we no longer necessarily need a
court system to arbitrate contract law, instead the contract will be
mathematically predetermined and enforced by the commons of the
cryptocurrency network. While I imagine that larger contracts would
likely be built with some sort of failsafe mechanism for arbitration,
there is no need for such a thing to exist. Would such a system be
subject to gaming by the parties involved? Yes of course, but I still
feel it would be an improvement on current generation contracts and
would certainly leave the door open to expanding complexity necessary to
close loopholes.

**The twin technologies of cryptocurrencies and cryptocontracts are
going to turn contract law into a programming language.**

Essentially what we are talking about is a real democratization of
contractual agreements. Whereas today contracts are restricted to deals
with enough value to justify a lawyers time (mortgages, business deals,
land transfer etc…), in the future there is no limit to what could be
codified into simple contracts. You could imagine forming a
self-enforcing contract around something as simple as sharing a
lawnmower with your neighbor, hiring a babysitter, or forming a gourmet
coffee club at work. Where this could really revolutionize things is in
developing nations, where the ability to exchange small-scale microloans
with self-enforcing contractual agreements that come at little or no
cost would be a quantum leap forward.

For more exotic examples, I was thinking of what could come if such
contracts were combined with the ubiquity of data tracking today. In my
example above, you could set up a contract with my blog to transfer a
micropayment to support the blog every time you refer to an idea you
found on my blog. Similar payment contracts could be set up for
knowledge archives like wikipedia where you might agree to submit a
micropayment every time you use or reference information from the site.

If we combine self-enforcing contracts with the idea of biological data
tracking then things could get really wild. Imagine that you are
carrying a cell phone which measures your emotional state. You then
enter a contract with an entertainment company to pay them a certain
amount based on the intensity of emotion which you experience during the
movie or video game you are using. Suddenly you would be no longer only
*figuratively* buying an emotional experience when you purchase
something, but you are *directly incentivizing emotional payout based on
a self-enforcing contract.*

At every level our lives are built around spoken and unspoken
agreements, yet the codification of a contractual agreement has been
relegated to only the most important and expensive transactions. The
emergence of cheap and plentiful self-enforcing contracts means that we
can codify simple transactions and agreements. **We will be able to
reprogram our lives based on self-enforcing cryptocontracts.**

The coming boom in cryptocontracts comes with its own risks as well. In
a world where self enforced contracts will be an everyday occurrence, we
must be much more careful clicking on those terms of service agreements
which nobody reads. We are going to need to be well aware of what it is
we are giving away. Similarly, we must each decide what we *want* to
codify in our own lives. Although it may be possible, it may not be wise
to establish contractual arrangements around romantic or family
relationships.

**Ultimately, cryptocontracts will offer us a revolutionary new way to
rebuild and reorganize our lives and our societies from the bottom up.**

*Edit: For those interested in the technology discussed here, I
encourage you to check out the [Ethereum](http://www.ethereum.org/)
project, which is working on developing a computing language to run
these types of contracts on a cryptocurrency backbone.*

*Edit2: I have been reading some of the comments on sites linking this
article and I want to clear up one common confusion. **The key
difference between a cryptocontract and a standard contract is that the
contract can itself hold wealth in the form of crytocurrency. All
contracting parties can see the format of the contract and agree on its
content, but the use of cryptography means nobody has access to the
funds until the program moves it in accordance with the guidelines
agreed.** Another point is that these contracts could easily implement a
clause for exception handling in the form of some form of court or other
3rd party mediation.*

    I think the idea is good, although I find the examples a little
    weak. There are things you need contracts for, and borrowing a
    lawnmower or a gourmet coffee club at work work best by being
    self-organizing. Unless I misunderstood and you meant
    crypto-contract as a pejorative term, in the same way
    crypto-politics is used.

    Not only would one have to be careful of clicking on the terms of
    service on a self-enforcing contract, one would have to fully
    understand the code being executed or trust a 3rd party’s assertion
    that the code enforces what it’s supposed to and only what it’s
    supposed to.

    Read up on Ted Nelson’s Xanadu project. 50 years back he envisioned
    a system where content could be syndicated in a measured way and
    each author would be compensated automatically.\
     However, remember we developers have a habit of wanting to abstract
    and code everything – forgetting the importance of human trust,
    intelligence and relationships in agreements that we make.

    Your argument: The internet, and computers, and money, think of the
    possibilities! Contract lawyers will be obsolete cause computers and
    money.\
     We already have the ability to transfer money when a condition of
    performance is met on a computer, but that is not a very useful
    tool. If someone is paid automatically upon triggering completion of
    some computerized task, they will undertake the minimum effort
    required to trigger and assert that, as far as they were concerned,
    they did a sufficient job. It is still up to the other party (and in
    disagreement, the courts) to rationally assess whether the
    performance required by the contract, was in fact, sufficiently met.

    The only aspect of the proposal I would argue, is that it requires a
    crypto currency. IMHO it would only require a means to
    electronically transmit remuneration. Current monetary systems are
    sufficiently electronic to allow this to work.\
     I’ve one question. If we are unable to keep business and government
    from creating backdoors, how do we keep them from creating loopholes
    for their own benefit?

    Very thought provoking, I wrote about how this dovetailed with my

     I think the idea of self-enforcing contracts is so important, I
    wonder if that will be the killer app of bitcoin that will take it
    from being an instrument of speculation to a foundational protocol
    like TCP.

    Brilliant post! Thanks so much for sharing these thoughts. This will
    also be an exciting line of work to get into. I’m imagining building
