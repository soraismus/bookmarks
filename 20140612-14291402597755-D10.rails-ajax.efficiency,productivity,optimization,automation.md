**Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\
**- Arthur C. Clarke

When Google first unveiled [GMail](http://gmail.google.com/), then
[GMaps](http://maps.google.com/), a firestorm of interest and activity
was generated ‚Äî not just in those Google applications, but the
technologies that powered them.

These web programming techniques (now, of course, known collectively as
AJAX) have become incredibly popular, especially among Web 2.0 startups
and their early adopters.

The developers of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) recognized
early on that allowing RoR developers to easily AJAX-ify their webapps
would be a great addition to the framework.

![image](/images/articles/features/optimize-ajax/rails_logo_remix.gif "Ruby on Rails")With
the addition of [RJS
Templates](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/rjsrails/) to Rails core, the
AJAX bar was lowered even further.

Simple AJAX requests like incrementing the number of
[diggs](http://digg.com/) a story has received, or splicing a comment
into a blog, are remarkably fast, not to mention user friendly.

What we‚Äôll be addressing today, though, is optimizing ever more complex
AJAX requests that might involve a multitude of SQL calls and JavaScript
rendering techniques.

Not all of the techniques are strictly JavaScript/browser-oriented. The
list was actually derived from the steps that we took to optimize
[Mailroom](http://sproutit.com/mailroom), the first app in the
[Sproutit](http://www.sproutit.com) suite for small businesses.

Mailroom is built for use with small teams; it can be used to manage
shared email accounts such as support@ and sales@. It combines an
ajax-rich front end with features like tagging, saved replies (for later
reuse) and shared internal conversation notes.

![image](/images/articles/features/optimize-ajax/sproutit_logo.gif)When
we first launched Mailroom, the service was reasonably fast. As we grew
and our server got busier, however, some customers started to complain
about how long it took for some of our AJAX functions to complete.

The following optimization techniques, though not complete by any means,
were just a few of the methods we used over the course of several weeks
to bring Mailroom, literally, up to speed.

Following the performance boost, Mailroom‚Äôs response times for a Load
Conversation call (via AJAX), went from 2-8 seconds to averaging less
than half a second. Once we added pre-caching (technique \#5) on the
client side via JavaScript, clicking on a message resulted in a
near-instantaneous load; sometimes faster than Outlook or Apple Mail.

### Possible Sources of Latency

When building out your AJAX application, it‚Äôs a good idea to keep in
mind the different sources of latency that can slow down the user
experience. These include:

1.  The Database (both in memory and filesystem swap)
2.  App Server Execution & Rendering
3.  The Webserver
4.  The Network
5.  The Browser (only in really complex AJAX apps)

There are others, but we hope this broadly covers them all. We‚Äôll only
be taking a look at a few of these sources, but it‚Äôs useful to keep them
all in mind as you build out your app.

### 5 Ways You Can Optimize Your Ruby on Rails/AJAX Application

1.  Optimal Database Indexing
2.  Eliminate Redundant SQL Queries
3.  Fragment Caching
4.  Response Text Compression/Minimization
5.  Pre-rendering and Client-side JavaScript Caching

### 1. Optimal Database Indexing

For many applications, database indexing will be the biggest performance
booster of them all.

Sample output from a Rails log file:

      Completed in 8.29523 (0 reqs/sec) | Rendering: 2.68176 (32%) | DB: 5.38202 (64%) | 200 OK [http://railsapp.org/action]

This action would be an ideal candidate for database optimization. If,
however, you see something like `DB: 0.05 (5%)`, the action is already
spending most of it‚Äôs time rendering and there‚Äôs probably not a lot you
can do in the way of database indexing.

It used to be somewhat difficult to pinpoint the exact function call in
your Rails app that was generating an SQL query. But with last year‚Äôs
release of Nathaniel Talbot‚Äôs [QueryTrace
plugin](http://blog.talbott.ws/articles/2006/05/17/querytrace-my-first-official-rails-plugin)
for Rails, this query back tracing process got a whole lot simpler.

After you install the QueryTrace plugin your Rails app (in the
‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô environment) will give you output like this in your
log/development.log:

     Conversation Load (0.001538)   SELECT * FROM conversations WHERE (conversations.id = 23453) LIMIT 1
        app/models/feed_observer.rb:14:in `after_create'
        app/controllers/conversation_controller.rb:162:in `send_to'
        script/server:3

As you can see, it‚Äôs now trivial to find the exact call that‚Äôs
generating the SQL database hit.

**Adding Indexes via Migrations**

The following is a migration‚Äôs *self.up* method to both create an
*articles* table and add a few indices:

    def self.up     # brings db schema to the next version
      create_table :articles do |t|
        t.column :title,      :string
        t.column :author_id,  :integer
        t.column :body,       :text
        t.column :is_live,    :boolean, :default => false
      end
      add_index :articles, :author_id
      add_index :articles, [ :author_id, :is_live ], :name => 'author_live_idx'
    end

This would create both a single-column index on the author\_id, as well
as a multi-column index on author\_id and is\_live.

When in doubt, use a tool like
[railsbench](http://railsbench.rubyforge.org/) or the [Ruby Performance
Validator](http://www.softwareverify.com/rubyPerformanceValidator/index.html)
to see where the bottlenecks are in your Rails app.

### 2. Eliminate Redundant SQL Queries

*Note: this one is more of a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù applicable to those of us who are
new to Ruby on Rails. (Since I‚Äôve fallen victim to this mistake several
times, I thought it was worth mentioning here.)*

It‚Äôs always a good idea to keep a ‚Äòtail -f log/development.log‚Äô open
when you are developing your Rails apps. (Win32 users can get tail, etc.
[here](http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/) or use
[Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) )

You might be surprised at what you find if you are not in the habit of
checking your query logs.

Ever written a quick hack like this?

      class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
        def current_member
          return Member.find(@session[:member])
        end
        helper_method :current_member
      end

Only to discover that you‚Äôre actually calling *current\_member* more
than once in a particular controller/view combination? (thus generating
multiple SQL calls for the same unchanged ActiveRecord object)

Here‚Äôs how to cache the variable in a per-request instance variable so
that the *Member.find(session[:member\_id])* database query only gets
called once per request:

      class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
        protected
          def current_member

            @current_member ||= Member.find(session[:member_id])
          end

          helper_method :current_member
        end
      end

### 3. Response Text Compression/Minimization

Before attempting the below technique, the simplest way to reduce the
number of bits sent across the wire is to enable gzip compression in
your web server.

Some links on gzip compress: [mod\_deflate (apache
2.2)](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_deflate.html), [thread on
config√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ing lighty with gzip](http://forum.lighttpd.net/topic/7729),
[apache 2.2 mod\_deflate
tutorial](http://losingmyjob.wordpress.com/2007/05/04/apache-22-mongrel-cluster/).

In the initial version of Mailroom, we were loading the *tag
conversation* HTML module via AJAX for every load conversation
request.![image](/images/articles/features/optimize-ajax/mailroom_tags.png)

There was quite a bit of superfluous HTML that was being returned, when
all we really needed was the specific tags that this particular
conversation had been tagged with.

By the way, this kind of optimization is helpful when you have one
master page load (where it‚Äôs OK to take 1-2 seconds longer), followed by
many successive AJAX requests that you want to be rendered as quickly as
possible.

We‚Äôre also targeting the size of the AJAX response text sent back by the
server. A 4k response text is of course more preferable to a 16k one.

Initially, this was the HTML snippet being returned for every load
conversation AJAX call:


    Choose from the tags below:


             ‚Ä¶ lots of tags  ‚Ä¶
        

    or enter some new tags: 

     ‚Ä¶
        

Instead of returning this whole chunk of HTML each call, we are going to
load a static, hidden HTML div once on the initial page load, and return
(via AJAX, each call) just the bare essential tag data needed to render
this static HTML into a per-conversation tag editor.

First we create a simple Tags object in javascript (with a little help
from
[Prototype](http://www.sergiopereira.com/articles/prototype.js.html)):

      Tags = Class.create();
      Tags.prototype =  {
        initialize: function(conversation_id, tag_str, tag_ids) {
          this.conversation_id  = conversation_id;
          this.tag_str          = tag_str;
          this.tag_ids          = tag_ids;
        }
      }

In your main page load, we render a *static* version of the tag editor
template that stays in a hidden div.

The static HTML in a hidden div:



            Tags: #TAGS#¬†
          ‚Ä¶ a lot more static HTML.  this olds a static list of tags   checkboxes for this organization  ‚Ä¶


When a conversation is loaded, the contents of the hidden div will be
read in via JavaScript. Regular expressions are performed against it on
the fly to replace elements like *\#TAGS\#* with actual per-conversation
data returned via the AJAX request.

Here we create a simple JavaScript function that pulls in the contents
of the hidden div, performs regex replacements on it, and completes with
a Prototype Insertion call of the newly rendered HTML.

      loadTagEditor: function(tags) {
        var tags_static = $('tag-editor-static').innerHTML;
        var regex = /-static/g;
        tags_static = tags_static.replace(regex, '');  # Strip out the "-static" portion of the ids

        var tags_regex = /#TAGS#/;
        tags_static = tags_static.replace(tags_regex, tags.tag_str);
        ...
        new Insertion.After('the-widget-before-tag-editor', tags_static);
      }

Now whenever a conversation is selected, we just need to make sure the
‚ÄúloadTagEditor(tags)‚Äù method is called.

There are a few gotchas you‚Äôll want to watch out for with this
technique, such as not ending up with duplicate ids in your HTML.

In the hidden, static divs, one way to avoid duplicate ids is to append
all your id names with ‚Äù-static‚Äù and then strip out the ‚Äù-static‚Äù when
you load in your hidden div HTML. (that‚Äôs what we do above with the
Regular Expression)

Now, our original chunk of HTML (which can really add up if you have 20
‚Äì 50 tags) that was previously being returned back with each Load
Conversation AJAX request‚Äîis now replaced with a few simple lines of
JavaScript:

      tags = new Tags(460857, 'home Marketing Development', new Array(1251, 1252, 1460));
      loadTagEditor(tags);

This is the Rails RJS (inside show\_conversation.rjs, perhaps) that
would be used to generate the above JavaScript:

      page << "tags = new Tags(#{@conversation.id}, '#{@conversation_tags * ' '}', new
    Array(#{@conversation_tag_ids.inspect_raw}));"
      page << "ch.loadTagEditor(tags);"

### 4. Fragment Caching

Here we‚Äôll use the ever so Web 2.0 example here of the tag cloud. These
little beauties can be expensive to calculate in SQL. Once you‚Äôre site
has been [TechCrunched](http://techcrunch.com/), you‚Äôll want to make
sure that your tag cloud (especially miniature versions loaded on
heavily-trafficked pages, or via AJAX) gets cached as a Rails HTML
fragment.

      class TagController < ApplicationController

        def tag_cloud
          fragment = read_fragment("myrailsapp.com/tagcloud")
          if not fragment
            setup_tag_cloud
            fragment = render :template => ‚Äútag/tag_cloud‚Äù
            write_fragment(‚Äùmyrailsapp.com/tagcloud‚Äù, fragment)
          else
            #logger.info ‚ÄúFragment cache read: #{fragment}‚Äù
            render :text => fragment and return
          end
        end

        private
          def setup_tag_cloud
            # Expensive SQL queries here ‚Ä¶
          end
      end

*Uncomment the logger.info call to verify that your fragment really is
being read from the cache!*

Admittedly, fragment caching in Rails can make your code less
maintainable. It‚Äôs a technique that should really only be used for
expensive-to-compute, fairly static portions of your site.

There are several helpful rails caching plugins on the Plugins page on
the RoR wiki.

One simple but effective plugin is the Timed File Store which allows you
to set an expiration (e.g. 15 minutes) on your cached fragments.

### 5. Client-side JavaScript Caching and Pre-rendering

If you *really* want to wow your users, pre-cache commonly called AJAX
components into hidden divs so that the only time necessary to load them
is the time it takes their browser to execute (eval) the pre-rendered
JavaScript.

In the following example, we‚Äôll cache conversations into hidden divs so
that whenever a user clicks on a conversation, it‚Äôll load almost
instantaneously.

The pre-caching functions will all access a single global JavaScript
variable that holds an array. That array will be populated on the first
page load with the conversation IDs that should be cached.

Here‚Äôs the inline JavaScript (placed at the bottom of the main rendered
HTML page):

      
      //
       // BTW - Watch out for this JavaScript gotcha:  When you instantiate an Array in JavaScript using
       //   a single integer paramater (e.g. new Array(37)), JavaScript assumes that you want to create an array of that size (e.g. 37 empty elements!).
       // Pad JS arrays with a leading zero to avoid this.
       // Reverse the array first so that we can simply pop off each element as we cache it (later on)
       var load_ids = new Array(0, <%= @widget_ids.reverse.inspect_raw %>);
       // Start the preLoader, with a delay of .5 seconds to give the main page time to load still.
         setTimeout(‚ÄùpreLoader()‚Äù, 500);
      //]]>
      

Here are the JavaScript functions that do the preloading/caching:

      // Uses JavaScript's "setTimeout" function to call the "loadFirst" method (once per id).
      //    This method handles the logic of delaying the first load (to give the parent HTML page
      //    time to load) and putting a delay between each AJAX load so as to not overwhelm
      //    the browser & server.
      function preLoader() {
        var cnt = 0;
        var offset = 250;              # Milliseconds to delay the initial load
        var delay_per_load = 500;      # Milliseconds between each load
        ids.each(
          function (id) {
            setTimeout("loadFirst()", (offset   (cnt * delay_per_load)));
            if (id > 0) {
              cnt  = 1;
            }
          }
        );
      }
      // Pops off the first element in the 'load_ids' array and loads it
      function loadFirst() {
        var id = load_ids.pop();
        if (id > 0) {
          preloadConversation(id);
        }
      }
      // Preloads the conversation specified by creating a new AJAX request -- Note the use of Prototype's
      //   "onComplete" method to specify that "cacheConversation" should be called when the AJAX request
      //   has been completed and its data returned.
      preloadConversation = function(conversation_id) {
        new Ajax.Request('/mailroom/conversation/'   conversation_id   '?preload=true', {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:false, onComplete: cacheConversation});
      }
      cacheConversation = function(originalRequest) {
        // ... omitting some "clever" hacks used to get the conversation id ('conv_id' variable) ...
        var hidden_div_id = 'pre-'   conv_id;
        // Set the Inner HTML of a hidden div to the JavaScript passed back that was generated by Rails RJS templates:
        $(hidden_div_id).innerHTML = encode(originalRequest.responseText);
      }

The following is the JavaScript function used to either A) load the
cached conversation, or B) if the cache is not present, load the
conversation directly off the server:

      loadConversation: function(id) {
        if ($('pre-'   id).innerHTML != '') {
          var decoded = decode($('pre-'   id).innerHTML);
          eval(decoded);
        } else {
          // Load the conversation via a new Ajax call (eval'ing the result by setting "evalScripts:true",
          //    then caching it via the onComplete parameter).
          new Ajax.Request('/mailroom/conversation/'   id, {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, onComplete: cacheConversation});
        }
      }

Phew. Well, there you have it. JavaScript, long the domain of cut n‚Äô
paste HTML jockeys, has proven in recent years to be a formidable
challenger to Flash (and Applets, remember those), once hailed as the
future of interactive web applications. Of course, each has their place
and own unique advantages and disadvantages.

While most applications wouldn‚Äôt need the kind of firepower described in
this technique, hopefully you‚Äôve learned a little bit about JavaScript,
Rails and RJS along the way.

    Yeah, very handy tips there, thanks!

    One question:

    Can you use the caching trick you mention in \#2 inside a model
    class? In other words, is the model class guaranteed to be
    re-populated on every request, or might it be cached by Rails
    between requests?
