Stephen Maydwell adjusts tins of Badger Balm before a machine fills them
at the W.S. Badger Co. Inc. factory in Gilsum, N.H.

Jack Rodolico

A corporation has one core obligation: to make money. But some companies
are signing a deal, promising to create not only profit but also a
tangible benefit to society and the environment. They're called benefit
corporations, and their movement has caught the ear of lawmakers across
the country.

In the tiny town of Gilsum, N.H., you'll find the headquarters of W.S.
Badger Co. Inc. The company makes all-natural cosmetics marketed under
the name Badger Balm. When CEO Bill Whyte founded the company two
decades ago, the staff was lean.**

"Early on, I started making soup on Friday. And I loved what happened to
the company, seeing everybody sit down at the same time," Whyte says.

**A Sense Of Togetherness**

That sense of togetherness extends to the company's 70 employees today.
Whyte took me on a tour — pointing out the company gym and yoga room as
well as the mixing room, which smells of citronella and lemongrass.

The cubicles at Badger are naturally lit and lined with wood. You can
bring your baby to work, or leave your 3-year-old at the company day
care center up the road.

So it's a nice place for the employees — and that seems to pay off for
the business. Badger has doubled in five years, expanding its market to
26 countries.

Badger is a good example of what's called a [benefit
corporation](https://www.bcorporation.net/community/ws-badger-co-inc).
This is a type of company certified as being motivated by more than just
the hunger for profit.

Think of it this way: USDA certifies organic foods, and Good
Housekeeping puts its seal of approval on quality products, like washing
machines and skillets. And since 2006, a nonprofit organization called B
Lab has been certifying corporations it deems to be concerned about
their communities and the environment.

**A Signal To The Consumer**

Erik Trojian, the director of policy, says B Lab measures just about
everything the company does: "Supply chain, their interaction with the
community, the environment. ... So that's one way that they signal to
the consumer that they're a different type of company — all the way from
Badger in New Hampshire,
[Patagonia](https://www.bcorporation.net/community/patagonia-inc), [Ben
and Jerry's](https://www.bcorporation.net/community/ben-jerrys). But
another way to do that is to bake your morals and your missions into the
DNA of your company."

Many consumers want to do business with companies that have that kind of
DNA. But how can they tell which ones are the real deal?

In [27
states](http://benefitcorp.net/state-by-state-legislative-status),
legislatures have created a legal status for benefit corporations. The
bill in New Hampshire originated with Badger.

So why would a company want a law? It's extra work, and there are no tax
breaks.

### [Company Ties Shoes And Ethics Together](http://www.npr.org/2012/04/07/150132233/company-strives-to-tie-shoes-and-ethics-together)

"There's so much 'green washing' going on out there," says Polina
Pinchevsky at [RoundPeg
Communications](https://www.bcorporation.net/community/roundpeg) in
Maryland. "There's so many companies claiming to care and to do the
right thing."

Tim Frick from
[MightyBytes](https://www.bcorporation.net/community/mightybytes-inc), a
tech company in Chicago, says being a benefit corporation is "being part
of a larger global movement of making sure that business is being used
as a force for good and not for evil."

**States Offer Legal Protections**

Pinchevsky and Frick also point out that there are legal protections
when a state signs on: A shareholder can't sue a benefit corporation for
valuing the environment as much as profit.

So basically, a state can create a legal framework for a benefit
corporation to work in. Then the company and its stakeholders can hash
out what benefit the corporation will provide.

Erik Trojian says B Lab, headquartered northwest of Philadelphia, will
continue certifying companies with its more rigorous standards. He
points out that there are problems because of the patchwork nature of
state laws.

For example, in Nevada, the state's incorporation document clearly lists
[benefit status](http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-078B.html) as an
option. And 236 companies signed up in only four months. That's a very
different experience from New Jersey's.

"Unfortunately, on the state's website, you can't find their
information, and you can't find stuff about benefit corporations,"
Trojian says.

New Jersey and some other states don't count how many companies have
registered, so it's tricky to know how many there are. But there are at
least 750 benefit corporations in the states that do count them.

Despite the differences from one state to the next, the overall movement
is gaining momentum. As many as nine states may take it up next year.
