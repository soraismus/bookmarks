Contractual
===========

Unobtrusive, backwards compatible syntactic sugar for [Design by
contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) in
JavaScript.

What?
=====

Design by contract is a very powerful technique for writing robust
software, it can be thought of as a formal but convenient method for
specifying assertions.

Instead of the developer documenting their assumptions in comments, or
worse, not documenting them at all, DbyC gives them a way to express
their assumptions in a convenient syntax, and have those assumptions
validated at runtime.

Contractual is a transpiler, that takes Contractual JavaScript and turns
it into JavaScript which enforces the contracts.

In Contractual, there are two types of contract,
[preconditions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precondition) and
[postconditions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcondition).

**Preconditions are evaluated before the main function body**, they are
typically used to validate arguments to the function, or the state of
the system.

**Postconditions are evaluated after the main function body completes**,
they are typically used to validate the return value of the function, or
any side effects that the function caused.

**Neither preconditions nor postconditions themselves may have
side-effects**, for instance it is not possible to increment a variable,
or assign a new value from within a contract.

Purity within contracts is enforced as much as possible by the
Contractual compiler, but it is possible for the developer to
circumvent, by calling another function which causes side effects.
**This is strongly discouraged.**

Why?
====

Because Design by contract leads to better software which is easier to
maintain.

JavaScript gives developers many opportunities to shoot themselves in
the foot, and this is a way to help keep their toes intact.

**DbyC can enforce an even greater level of safety than even the most
stringent type system.**

How it works
============

Contractual abuses two quirks of the JavaScript language to implement a
convenient backwards compatible syntax.

1.  #### Results of expressions do not *have* to be used.

    This means that the following code is valid:

        function myfun (a) {
          a > 10;
        }

    In this example, when `myfun()` is called the JavaScript engine will
    evaluate the `a > 10` expression but silently discard the result.

2.  #### Labels can appear anywhere in a function body, and they also do not *have* to be used.

    This means that the following code is valid:

        function myotherfun (a) {
          foo:
          return a * a;
        }

    In this example, when `myotherfun()` is called, the JavaScript
    engine will simply ignore the `foo` label (but not the label body!)
    and behave as if it doesn't exist.

\
\

Contractual combines these quirks to offer a simple syntax for
specifying preconditions and postconditions.

    function divide (a, b) {
      pre:
        typeof a === 'number';
        typeof b === 'number';
        b !== 0, 'May not divide by zero';
      main:
        return a / b;
      post:
        __result < a;
    }

    alert(divide(10, 0));

This is normal, valid JavaScript. If you execute it without compiling it
with Contractual, it will still behave just as normal, but the contracts
will not be enforced.

In default mode, Contractual will compile the above code into:

    var OBLIGATIONS = require('obligations');
    function divide(a, b) {
        OBLIGATIONS.precondition(typeof a === 'number');
        OBLIGATIONS.precondition(typeof b === 'number');
        OBLIGATIONS.precondition(b !== 0, 'May not divide by zero');
        var __result;
        __result = a / b;
        OBLIGATIONS.postcondition(__result < a);
        return __result;
    }
    alert(divide(10, 0));

Now the `alert()` call in the above code will result in a
`PreconditionError`.

    PreconditionError: May not divide by zero

 **Note:** Contractual allows customization of many aspects of the
generated code, you can change the library name, use a global object
instead, change the names of generated variables etc.

Download / Install
==================

Install Contractual from [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/contractual):

    npm install -g contractual

You may also download the source from
[github](https://github.com/codemix/contractual/releases).

If you download the source from github, don't forget to install the
dependencies after extracting the archive: `npm install`

Usage
=====

It's possible to use Contractual programatically, but most functionality
is exposed via a command line interface.

    > contractual --help

    contractual - Syntactic sugar for Design by contract in JavaScript.

    Usage: contractual [OPTIONS] [FILES]

    Options:
      --output, -o   The directory to write compiled files to.                             [default: "./out"]
      --libname, -l  The name of the identifier for the obligations library                [default: "OBLIGATIONS"]
      --global, -g   Whether a global identifier should be used for the obligations lib.   [default: false]
      --require, -r  The obligations library to require, if `global` is not specified.     [default: "obligations"]
      --version, -v  Show the version information.
      --help, -h     Show this help screen.

### Compile a directory

Compile all the Contractual JavaScript files in the `src` directory to
the `lib` directory:

    > contractual -o ./lib ./src

### Use a global identifier

If you're targetting the browser, you might prefer to use a global
reference to the obligations library, rather than requiring it
separately at the top of each file. Using the `global` flag instructs
Contractual to omit the generated `require` statements.

    > contractual -g -o ./lib ./src

### Using a different obligations library

Contractual uses the tiny
[obligations](https://github.com/codemix/obligations) library by
default. If you'd like to use a different library, you can specify its
name using the `require` flag.

    > contractual --require=mylib -o ./lib ./src

### Changing the name of the obligations identifier

By default Contractual accesses the obligations library under the name
`OBLIGATIONS`, which is pretty ugly but likely to be unique in a code
base. If you'd like to use a different identifier, use the `libname`
flag.

    > contractual --libname=contracts -o ./lib ./src

The above will generate preconditions that look like
`contracts.precondition(...)` rather than
`OBLIGATIONS.precondition(...)` etc.
