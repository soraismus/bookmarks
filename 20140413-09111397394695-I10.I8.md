Linked-In made the
[article](http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130506104243-86541065-how-graduates-can-get-ahead?trk=mp-reader-card)
sound so promising: *Jack Welch tells graduating seniors how to
succeed!*It took only a few minutes to read, but left me scratching my
head. Here is Jack Welch, the man *Fortune*magazine named as manager of
the last century, dictating what it takes to succeed and here I am, a
successful executive in this century, recognizing exactly none of it.
Jack’s advice would not only have set me back a decade getting where I
am now, it contradicts the career strategy that has taken me and many of
my contemporaries to the top of our respective fields.

In a nutshell, what Jack suggests is to work hard and over deliver,
impress your boss (with “shock and awe” no less) and make yourself
valuable to your company. It makes a good sound bite, but this advice
is, at best, a placebo to make you feel like you are being proactive in
managing your career, and, at worse, a slow poison that will prolong
your servitude to the corporate machine.

Let’s begin with his advice to work hard and over deliver. The truth is,
working hard only makes you stand out when you are the only one doing
it. Everyone who gets ahead works hard. It is not a strategy; it’s table
stakes. Unless you live at the office, you will likely never be the
first to arrive, the last to leave or the one who produces the highest
volume of work. Your determination to out deliver your hard working
colleagues is more likely to land you on a therapist’s couch than in the
executive suite.

When everyone is working their ass off, working yours off harder or
faster won’t get you ahead. It will stretch you thin and stress you out
and this stress will, in turn, hold you back. The business world is
chock full of hard working people who regularly over deliver and yet are
categorically *not*succeeding. The intersection of overworked and
underachieved is a horrible place to be.

Jack’s next exercise in futility is to impress your boss. Such obeisance
may have worked last century but in this one it will do little more than
consign you to the career of a follower. Mindlessly working hard to
impress someone else will ensure that your success is always dependent
on that someone else.

You may not even get that far. In today’s working environment, even
figuring out who to impress isn't easy. Modern matrix organizations like
Facebook, Netflix, Twitter and many other progressive and
ultra-successful companies, have blurred the lines between manager and
managed. This structure is quickly becoming the rule rather than the
exception. At Google employees are actively encouraged to change
projects, and thus manager, at 18 month intervals. Even the biggest of
companies have peer committees to decide promotion and advancement. Who
you report to has never meant less than it does now.

Managers are no longer the all-powerful career makers they were last
century. In fact, many modern workers will have a hard time staying with
a boss long enough to do more than share space during group meetings. I
had 4 managers in 4 years at Microsoft and 2 managers in less than 3
years at Google. (Had I stayed I would have moved to my 3rd.) Exactly
which one was I to spend all that time impressing?

Bosses have less power than they have ever had. In many companies,
managers are just peers who take on some additional leadership and
administrative tasks. Trying to impress them is not time well spent.

The most valuable role a modern manager plays is that of mentor. But
time has changed this role too. In Jack’s day, you were stuck with your
manager and everyone who could positively affect your career was within
line of sight of your desk. The world is so much more accessible now and
the most important person to your career may be on the other side of the
planet connected to you only through email, video conference and social
networking. Or, they may be someone with whom you have never had
first-person contact. The world is smaller now and we have less need of
our boss to tell us how to navigate it.

Of all the people who have helped my career and taken my shock and awe
to heart, none of them have ever been my manager. Many are at or only
slightly above or below my level. Most are peers and the majority aren't
even inside my company at all. Had I ignored any of these mentors in
favor of the person writing my annual review, I would not be where I am
today.

Bosses come and go. Time spent impressing them is time you could be
spending more intentionally to better your situation and yourself. You
are who you learn from and now choosing *who*is entirely in your own
hands.

Finally, we get to Jack’s last piece of advice: make yourself valuable
to your company, and once again I advise you to ignore it. Like the
person you report to, the company you work for has never mattered less.

Consider just how much Jack and his peers were tied to their employer in
the 60s, 70s and 80s. Where else would they have gone? In the days
before online job postings and career websites like Monster.com and
Linked-In how would other employers have found out about them? Choice
was limited and required substantial effort to exercise. Opportunities
within one’s company were much more accessible than without.

Indeed, the world at large was harder to discover. Daily newspapers and
weekly business magazines reported official press releases days to weeks
old. How do you decide where the grass might be greener given only this
limited information? Staying put, working hard and beating out your
coworkers for promotion was the path of least resistance. Today it is,
at best, the slow road and more likely to end directly at that dreaded
intersection of overworked and underachieved.

The industry at large is now, quite literally, at your fingertips.
Journalists compete to report up-to-the-second information about
products companies haven’t even released yet. Corporate road maps are
analyzed and reanalyzed and measured based on Twitter “follows” or
Linked-In “connects.” It’s never been easier to scope-out and judge
potential employers and if one of them aligns with your particular
passions their recruiters are only an email, tweet or connect away. In
fact, if you know how to work the industry, those recruiters probably
have you on their radar already.

Company Kool-Aid is a dangerous drink. Gulp it down and you’ll have
little value to the broader industry. Don’t let Jack buy you that drink.
The rewards for gulping it down are more immediate but much smaller in
the long run than sipping it carefully and keeping your options open.
The pulse of the industry is far more important than the pulse of a
company that may become less relevant in these fast moving times. Make
yourself valuable to the broader industry and insulate yourself from
your company’s mistakes and hard times. *You*must always remain valuable
no matter what happens to your company. Just ask all those GE employees
“Neutron Jack” downsized about where company loyalty lies. You can serve
your company all you want. It may or may not serve you back. Your
loyalty must lie with your own career in the industry where you've
chosen to work.

Let’s put Jack Welch’s advice into perspective. He started work in
1960—the same year the Dallas Cowboys became an NFL expansion team, New
Zealand got its first television station, John Lennon and Paul McCartney
named their band, and Muhammad Ali won his first professional fight.
Jack retired as CEO of the same company 40 years later, a time when the
PC was still the most relevant computing device, Google was a start-up
and Apple was taking loans from Microsoft.

Time changes a lot of things and career advice from Neutron Jack is like
dating advice from your parents. Sorry dad, you lost me at “courting.”
We live in a time where college dropouts have founded well-respected
companies. Serial entrepreneurs from unranked schools are out innovating
well-funded, hard-working corporate machines — and out earning corporate
vice presidents. It’s time to update the career manual.

Outdated business rules will not only accomplish little in this modern
world, they will interfere with your career progress. If you take this
impressing your boss and over-delivery advice to heart you’ll very
likely to be too busy (because you are working so hard) or too
complacent (because your boss is telling you how great you are) to see
an opportunity when it presents itself. You’ll be blinded by the feeling
that you are already doing the right thing when, in fact, you should be
consciously seeking out the *actual*right thing.

The industry has changed. Corporate culture has changed. Careers are no
longer something we *have*; careers are something we must *own.*Anyone
can have a job, but a career is something more. Careers are at once more
meaningful and more enjoyable. They are something that can make a huge
difference to our self worth, our net worth and our work-life balance.
They don’t rely on bosses and employers. They rely on *you*.

Success isn't easy. If it was everyone would have a constantly ascending
career path. Don’t make success harder by following advice for a bygone
era. Today, success requires a modern perspective on the industry and
actively managing your skills and relationships.

Leave all that other advice in the museum where it belongs.

    Fantastic article, I couldn't agree more. I enjoy the fact that
    one's job is no longer the definition of who you are; you are no
    longer just one of the sheep in the industry. You have the ability
    to show how valuable you are on a global scale, by showcasing your
    skills and ambitions with a plethora of new mediums that did not
    previously exist in Jack's era. I've personally noticed the fall of
    the importance of standard education. More and more job descriptions
    have detailed a need for a specific skillset, not a specific degree
    or schooling level. This makes certain careers more accessible to
    the many, or to the skilled, instead of to the privileged.

    So I ask you a question: How many hours a week do you work ? And
    include in that the work you take home, the e-mails and phones you
    answer after you punch out, etc.

    Then, how many days a week you work (Treehouse recently shared an
    article about how they're working 4 days a week).

    Once you answer that, ponder if you're really "not" working hard.

    This Memo obviously only goes to well educated, well connected, long
    employed 10%-earners.

    Anybody else: Here is your minimum wage, see ya tomorrow, you have
    to work two hours more.

    We are constantly lied to about job opportunities and how to get
    them by upper management so that they can take advantage of us. Why
    are they telling everyone to go to college when there are no jobs?
    Why are they telling everyone to work hard when they admonish hard
    work?
