Macros in vim can be a huge time saver, especially if they apply to a
large number of lines. A trick I've been using recently is to use
recursive macros to format large chunks of a file.

Let's say we have the following list of thousands of dates:

    10/30/2013
    11/30/2013
    12/30/2013
    ...

And we want to change each to the following:

    10/30/2013 : 10-30-2013
    11/30/2013 : 11-30-2013
    12/30/2013 : 12-30-2013
    ...

Macro Recording Time
--------------------

Let's create the macro:

    qqq             #clear out anything that may already be in the q register
    qq              #start recording a macro and store it in the q register
    y$              #copy to the end of the current line
    A               #append the end of the current line
    <Space>:<Space> #add a colon surrounded by spaces
    <Escape>        #return to visual mode
    p               #paste the date from the buffer
    F/              #find the last instance of /
    r-              #replace the / with a -
    ;.              #repeat the last find and replace
    ^               #go to the front of the line
    j               #move down one line
    @q              #make the macro recursive by having it invoke itself
    q               #stop recording the macro

Now when you run `@q` vim will run the macro on every line until it
finishes while you sit back and relax. I like using recursive macros
because the loop will be exited if it fails to execute on a line. This
improves the speed of making changes without risking applying it
incorrectly throughout the file, provided you write your macros
carefully.
