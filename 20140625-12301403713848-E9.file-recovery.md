Recovering deleted files using only grep
========================================

June 24, 2014

In my college systems class we were required to implement `malloc`.

I spent a week or so on it. No version control — I was both youthful and
arrogant.

After ironing out all the little systems bugs, I began cleaning up the
directory to package up and send off for grading. I went to remove
something in the same directory that also started with the letter m, and
when I hit tab, zsh helpfully completed this to `malloc.c`.

By the time I had noticed, it was too late.

I had just run `rm malloc.c`.

`grep` to the rescue
--------------------

I knew that `grep` works on a lot of the virtual filesystems available
in \*nix, like `/proc`. I thought, “why not `/dev/*` too?”

I figured I could use a command like this to grep over raw disk data —
not over files or anything like that, just on the raw data on disk — and
if successful, I’d have a resonable shot at recovering my homework.

I now doubt that this idea is even remotely original — `grep` was
probably designed to do exactly this sort of thing.

Anyway, after RTFM'ing for awhile, eventually I ran a command that
looked vaguely like this:

    $ grep --binary-files=text --context=x 'stringfromyourfile' \
        /dev/whateverPartition > someFile.txt

The gist of what we’re doing here is running grep over the partition
`/dev/whateverPartition`, finding the string `'stringfromyourfile'`, and
grabbing the `x` lines bookending that string. If you pick `x` to be big
enough, you should get the entire file, plus a bit of junk around the
edges. [EDIT: [HN user sparkie points
out](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7944515) that this is actually
not entirely accurate!] Though, of course, the string has to be unique
on your disk, or this will fail.

The key to this is actually the flag `--binary-files=text`; that tells
grep to run on the binary disk data even though it doesn’t really make
any sense.

In the end, this proved good enough and I got my homework back. It’s a
nifty hack that I don’t expect to need to use again, though it’s worth
knowing that in principle it can be done, especially if you need to look
for something else in some binary file, somewhere.
