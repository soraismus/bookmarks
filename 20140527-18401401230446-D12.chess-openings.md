For the 3rd installment in my series of
[blog](http://www.randalolson.com/2014/05/24/a-data-driven-exploration-of-the-evolution-of-chess-match-lengths-and-outcomes/)
[posts](http://www.randalolson.com/2014/05/24/chess-tournament-matches-and-elo-ratings/)
exploring a data set of over 650,000 chess tournament games ranging back
to the 15th century, I wanted to look at how chess openings have grown
and waned in popularity over time. Again, I only have reliable data on
chess games back to 1850, so 1850 will be my starting point.

The first few moves of a chess game, known as the [chess
opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_opening), are one of the
most-studied aspects of the game, largely because of how important they
can be. If you don’t start off with a good opening, you could doom
yourself to defeat before the game really even begins. It’s therefore no
surprise that one of the key steps to becoming a skilled chess player is
studying and memorizing the [many varieties of
openings](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess_Opening_Theory). Hundreds
of openings have been developed since 1850, so it should make for an
interesting exercise to see how these openings have evolved since then.

Each chess game is recorded in [PGN
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation), which
means that it stores every move each player made, the outcome of the
game, etc. Here’s an example game in PGN format:

`[Event "Hoogovens A Tournament"] [Site "Wijk aan Zee NED"] [Date "1999.01.20"] [EventDate "?"] [Round "4"] [Result "1-0"] [White "Garry Kasparov"] [Black "Veselin Topalov"] [ECO "B06"] [WhiteElo "2812"] [BlackElo "2700"] [PlyCount "87"]`

\1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Be3 Bg7 5. Qd2 c6 6. f3 b5\
 7. Nge2 Nbd7 8. Bh6 Bxh6 9. Qxh6 Bb7 10. a3 e5 11. O-O-O Qe7\
 12. Kb1 a6 13. Nc1 O-O-O 14. Nb3 exd4 15. Rxd4 c5 16. Rd1 Nb6\
 17. g3 Kb8 18. Na5 Ba8 19. Bh3 d5 20. Qf4+ Ka7 21. Rhe1 d4\
 22. Nd5 Nbxd5 23. exd5 Qd6 24. Rxd4 cxd4 25. Re7+ Kb6\
 26. Qxd4+ Kxa5 27. b4+ Ka4 28. Qc3 Qxd5 29. Ra7 Bb7 30. Rxb7\
 Qc4 31. Qxf6 Kxa3 32. Qxa6+ Kxb4 33. c3+ Kxc3 34. Qa1+ Kd2\
 35. Qb2+ Kd1 36. Bf1 Rd2 37. Rd7 Rxd7 38. Bxc4 bxc4 39. Qxh8\
 Rd3 40. Qa8 c3 41. Qa4+ Ke1 42. f4 f5 43. Kc1 Rd2 44. Qa7 1-0

With a bit of text parsing, I can count the number of times each chess
opening was used on a per-game basis. For this analysis, I’ll look at
the openings in four classes: White’s first move, Black’s first move,
White’s second move, and Black’s second move.

### White’s first move

It’s a well-known fact that [White has a small
advantage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-move_advantage_in_chess)
at the beginning of the game. To maintain this advantage, White should
press their advantage to take over the middle of the board as quickly as
possible. The most popular first White moves from 1850-2014 are shown
below. Note that all of these are fairly aggressive openings that build
toward control of the middle of the board.

[![w-first-moves-over-time](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/w-first-moves-over-time-1024x585.png)](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/w-first-moves-over-time.png)

In 1850, White openings were fairly homogeneous: Most chess experts
played [King’s Pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Pawn_Game).
Chess players didn’t begin to explore variants of the King’s Pawn in
earnest until the 1890s, when [Queen’s
Pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_pawn) (moving a Pawn to
d4) started to replace King’s Pawn in some player’s repertoires. The
1920s saw another burst of innovation with the rising popularity of the
[Zukertort Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zukertort_Opening)
(moving the Knight to f3) and the [English
Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_opening) (moving a Pawn
to c4), which completed the set of staple first-turn openings that are
really ever used nowadays.

### Black’s first move

Many of Black’s opening moves are more defensive in nature and attempt
to undermine White’s initial advantage. In 1850, it was standard fare
for Black to match the ever-popular King’s Pawn by moving a Pawn to e5
(the [Open Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game)). Although I
typically group unpopular openings into the “Other” category, I wanted
to point out the short-lived spike in popularity of the [Pirc
Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirc_Defence) in the 1850s.
Though the Pirc Defence is typically thought of as a [relatively new
opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirc_Defence#General_remarks),
[Moheschunder
Bannerjee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moheschunder_Bannerjee) used
this opening almost exclusively in his 50+ games against [John
Cochrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cochrane_(chess_player)),
winning 40% of the games (far above his overall 24% win rate as Black).

[![wb-first-moves-over-time](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/wb-first-moves-over-time-1024x585.png)](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/wb-first-moves-over-time.png)

Moreover, the rise of the Queen’s Pawn in the 1890s resulted in the rise
of the [Closed Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_Game) in the
1890s. Black openings similarly saw a burst of innovation in the 1920s,
with the development of the [Indian
Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Defence) in response to
the Queen’s Pawn, and the introduction of the ever-popular [Sicilian
Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence) in response to
the standard King’s Pawn. By 2014, the Open Game is well past its glory
days, and seems to be on its way out.

The [French Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence) seems
to have been a staple Black opening for the past 164 years, consistently
comprising 5%-10% of all chess games. Amusingly, the French Defence has
a reputation for solidity and resilience, which is also reflected in its
historical usage.

### White’s second move

Here’s where things get complicated. I noted in the first section that
the most popular first moves for White have historically been King’s and
Queen’s Pawn, so that’s why the more popular second moves for White
exclusively start with them. The Zukertort and English Openings simply
haven’t become popular enough yet for their followup moves to show up
here.

[![wbw-second-move-over-time](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/wbw-second-move-over-time-1024x585.png)](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/wbw-second-move-over-time.png)

With the waning popularity of the Open Game over time, it’s no surprise
that the responses to it have similarly declined. By 2014, the typical
response to the Open Game is to play the [King’s
Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King), with the once-popular
[King’s Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Gambit) and
[Vienna Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_game) becoming all
but extinct. The Sicilian Defence’s explosive rise to popularity is
again reflected here, with the [Open
Sicilian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence#Open_Sicilian:_2.Nf3_and_3.d4)
(Knight to f3) becoming White’s standard response. Again, White’s
response to Black’s French Defence (moving a Pawn to d4) has remained
consistently popular over time, rarely dropping below 5% of the games
played each year.

To avoid being overly wordy here, I’ll allow the visualization to speak
for itself and leave the reader to explore the remaining trends as they
please.

### Black’s second move

If you’re familiar with chess, you know how quickly the set of possible
moves grows with each move a player makes. After White and Black’s first
turn, the board will be in one of 400 unique positions. After their
second turn, there are [197,742 possible
positions](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2010-12/fyi-how-many-different-ways-can-chess-game-unfold).
And after only 3 turns, 121 million possible positions. This means that
if you play enough chess, it’s highly likely that you will play a game
that [no one has ever
played](http://www.radiolab.org/story/153809-rules-set-you-free/) in the
history of our universe. You can only imagine how difficult it would be
to visualize all possible chess moves even up to the third turn.

Despite the infinite possibility in chess, there appears to be a strong
bias toward a small subset of openings. In this data set, there were
roughly 4,000 unique openings, and the 30 most popular ones comprise 70%
of all chess games. Below is a visualization of the distribution of
those 30 most popular openings from 1850-2014.

(Have any thoughts on a better way to visualize this data? Please leave
them in the comments! I’ve already reached the limit of what area charts
can effectively visualize by Black’s second move.)

Interestingly, chess appears to be becoming more diverse over time.
Whereas there were less than 100 unique openings by the end of both
player’s second turn in 1850, there were over 1,000 unique openings by
2014. This may be an artifact of the data set, however, because there
are [far more games recorded in the 21st
century](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/chess-year-distribution.png)
in this data set.

That’s it for today. In the next installment, I’ll be looking at more
higher-level features of player strategy over time.

    Fun database to explore.

    \> Have any thoughts on a better way to visualize this data?

    I’d try overlaid smoothed lines of popularity by year of the top
    10-15 lines of play. As you saw, stacked area charts start to lose
    their utility when the baselines get too varied. With the smoother,
    this may be the case where less detail equals more insight. Possibly
    you can color the lines by White’s success rate.

        Interesting idea. My primary concern with using overlaid lines
        is that many of the openings comprise 1% or less of the data set
        each year, whereas a select few comprise 15% or more at any
        given time. Thus the select few would stand out on top, whereas
        the majority of the openings would be fighting for space in the
        0-1% region.

        I could of course solve this by plotting the logged values, but
        then that would be hard to interpret, e.g., what does -8 in log
        space mean for the real fraction?

    Hi Randy,

    Great work! If you are interested, I have a few suggestions and
    ideas that you might want to try out.

    First and foremost, I recommend exploring the connection between the
    move’s prevalence and it’s performance – that’s the big message of
    my analysis of Go openings I think. Players seem to be quite
    attentive to moves that preceded victory (either their own, or the
    wins of their colleagues). Whether or not there’s actually a causal
    connection is outside my expertise, but I can say that from the data
    it certainly looks like the players think there is.

    As far as move diversity goes, in biology the big problem with doing
    unique type counts (species, alleles, etc.) is that they miss the
    relative abundance of each type. A way to reduce the data is to
    deploy a diversity metric – the two most popular are Shannon’s
    entropy and Simpson’s diversity index. It would be interesting to
    see if the Shannon entropy for opening moves was increasing along
    with unique counts (it does in Go).

    A third aspect, if you can get it, is player metadata like age – are
    there big differences between young players and older players in
    their willingness to adopt new openings?

    The fourth is demographic – is a move becoming more popular each
    year because it’s spreading epidemiologically from player to player,
    or because players who enter the dataset are already using it more
    than the population average the previous year?

    I do not know but in late 60s and early 70s, lot of theoretical work
    was done in Russia, on some openings like Ruy Lopez and Guioco
    Piano. These got analysed upto something like 30 moves.\
     Those were the years when the literature was available only in
    Russian and Russia ( or USSR, as it was known) dominated the chess
    scene. In mid 70s, Fischer brought Sicilian Defence in to
    popularity.\
     Currently, the opening is getting defined by upto 15 moves.
    Analysing first 4 to 6 moves may not give the true insight, even
    though, computer chess has resulted in lookup tables upto that many
    moves.

    By the way, Bret, where is that analysis of Go game moves, you
    quote?

    I was wondering if you could make separate charts for each of the
    common openings. For example, for white’s second move, I would like
    to have seen 5 separate charts each with the popularity of the
    response based on which one of the five main responses black made in
    the first move. That way you can see what has become popular to do
    by situation instead of just kind of re-viewing the popularity of
    the past moves over time. In this same way, you could do a black’s
    second move based on the 9 common white second moves you have and
    have 9 charts, each not being all that complicated.

        I like this idea. I think it would actually work best as an
        interactive chart. e.g., it starts out with White’s first move.
        Then you could click in the area where you want to zoom (e.g.,
        King’s Pawn) and it would show a new area chart for Black’s
        first move in response to King’s Pawn. And so on.

        Any interactive data viz wizards want to help make this happen?

    In literary history there is a discussion on the “authenticity” of
    games described in narratives, like De Cessolis’s treaty Ludus
    scaccorum translated afterwards in many Europ. languages. It would
    bve interesing to identify their moves as belonging to the
    historical types of openings.

    For how to visualize, check out this visualization from the Times.
    Similar challenge of showing multiple increasing pathways. But they
    don’t have to deal with the extra dimension of time.
