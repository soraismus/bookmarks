Grunt](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shadow-dom.jpg)

[![Grunt
Logo](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/grunt-logo-266x300.png)](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/grunt-logo.png)Grunt
is a task runner that can dramatically improve your front-end
development workflow. With the use of a number of grunt plugins you can
automate tasks such as compiling Sass and CoffeeScript, optimizing
images and validating your JavaScript code with JSHint.

You may have used something like CodeKit or Hammer to handle these tasks
in the past. I think both of these apps are great (and have used them
extensively in the past) but where Grunt wins out is customizability.
There are masses of plugins available to help integrate everything from
image optimizing to CSS style injection into your workflow.

In this blog post you are going to learn how to set up Grunt and
configure tasks to handle Compass & Sass compilation, JSHint, and CSS
styling injection.

Lets get started.

Installing the Grunt Command Line Interface
-------------------------------------------

Our first job is to install the Grunt command line interface. This is
responsible for locating the grunt library in your project and loading
the `Gruntfile.js` configuration (more on this later).

Grunt and Grunt plugins are both installed using
[npm](https://npmjs.org/), the Node.js package manager. If you don‚Äôt
have Node.js installed on your machine visit the [download
page](http://nodejs.org/download/) and grab the installer for your
operating system. Follow the steps in the installation wizard and you
should be up and running in no time. npm is included in the install.

Once you have Node.js and npm installed you can install the `grunt-cli`
package.

    npm install -g grunt-cli

The `-g` flag will install `grunt-cli` globally so you will only ever
have to run this command once.

Creating a package.json File
----------------------------

Now that you‚Äôve got the Grunt CLI installed it‚Äôs time to install the
Grunt task runner.

In order to better manage the dependencies for your project it‚Äôs best to
create a `package.json` file. If you‚Äôre familiar with Rails development
this is similar to a `Gemfile`.

The `package.json` file should be placed in the root of your project.
This file defines data about the project such as the project name,
version and author. The `package.json` file is also responsible for
managing dependencies. The `devDependencies` property defines the
different packages that are needed for your application.

    {
      "name": "project-name",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "author": "Your Name",
      "devDependencies": {
        "grunt": "~0.4.1",
        "grunt-contrib-jshint": "~0.6.3",
        "grunt-contrib-watch": "~0.5.3",
        "grunt-contrib-compass": "~0.6.0"
      }
    }

* * * * *

**Note**: This is a very basic example of a `package.json` file. For a
comprehensive list of all the properties that can be specified check out
[the documentationn](https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html).

* * * * *

Once you have created your `package.json` file you can install all of
the dependencies you specified using a single command:

    npm install

This command will fetch all of the packages and store them in a new
`node_modules` directory in your project route. You may want to add this
directory to you `.gitignore` file (or similar) so that it doesn‚Äôt get
checked in to version control. Make sure that your `package.json` file
is added to version control though, as this is what other developers
will use to make sure that they have all the packages installed that the
project needs.

If you want to install addition packages you can again use the
`npm install` command. This time specifying the name of the package you
wish to install.

    npm install <module> --save-dev

Using the `--save-dev` flag will cause npm to automatically add this
package to the dependencies in your `package.json` file ‚Äì a handy little
trick to save you some time and make sure that you don‚Äôt forget to
update the file yourself.

Defining Tasks in the Gruntfile
-------------------------------

Next you need to create a file called `Gruntfile.js`. This is where you
define and configure the tasks that you want Grunt to run.

Lets take a look at an example that uses the plugins specified in your
`package.json` file.

    module.exports = function(grunt) {

      // Project configuration.
      grunt.initConfig({
        pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),
        watch: {
          css: {
            files: [
              '**/*.sass',
              '**/*.scss'
            ],
            tasks: ['compass']
          },
          js: {
            files: [
              'assets/js/*.js',
              'Gruntfile.js'
            ],
            tasks: ['jshint']
          }
        },
        compass: {
          dist: {
            options: {
              sassDir: 'assets/sass',
              cssDir: 'assets/css',
              outputStyle: 'compressed'
            }
          }
        },
        jshint: {
          options: {
            jshintrc: '.jshintrc'
          },
          all: ['Gruntfile.js', 'assets/js/*.js']
        }
      });

      // Load the Grunt plugins.
      grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-compass');
      grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');
      grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');

      // Register the default tasks.
      grunt.registerTask('default', ['watch']);
    };

### The Wrapper Function

All of code for your Gruntfile must be placed within the ‚Äòwrapper‚Äô
function. This convention is needed so that Grunt can understand the
file.

    module.exports = function(grunt) {
      // Configuration, Tasks and Plugins.
    };

### Project Configuration

The next section in the Gruntfile is the project configuration. This is
handled by the `grunt.initConfig` method. This method should be passed
an object containing the project configuration as well as any task
configurations.

The `pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),` line imports the config
data from the `package.json` file you created earlier. Many Grunt
plugins rely on this data for things like the project name and version.

    grunt.initConfig({
      pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),
      task: {...},
      task_two: {...}
    });

### Configuring Tasks

Each Grunt task has it‚Äôs own configuration within the object passed to
`grunt.configInit`. The name of the property containing the task
configuration is almost always the same as the name of the grunt task.

Lets run through the task configurations in your Gruntfile.

The **watch** task executes other tasks when certain files are changed.
This is useful for doing things like compiling your Sass files to CSS
every time that a Sass file is saved. The configuration for the watch
task looks as follows.

    watch: {
      css: {
        files: [
          '**/*.sass',
          '**/*.scss'
        ],
        tasks: ['compass']
      },
      js: {
        files: [
          'assets/js/*.js',
          'Gruntfile.js'
        ],
        tasks: ['jshint']
      }
    },

In this configuration we have defined two different *targets*. One to
handle what should happen when a Sass file changes, and one to handle
changes to JavaScript files. The `files` property of both of these
targets specifies which files the watch task should monitor. You can use
wildcards (\*) here to save yourself having to list out each file
individually. The `tasks` property defines an array of grunt tasks that
should be executed when a change is made to one of the files in that
target.

The Gruntfile uses the `grunt-contrib-compass` plugin to compile Sass so
that you have the added goodness of
[Compass](http://compass-style.org/). There is also a [pure Sass
plugin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass) if you don‚Äôt use
Compass. You will need to have Ruby, Sass and Compass installed for this
plugin to work.

    compass: {
      dist: {
        options: {
          sassDir: 'assets/sass',
          cssDir: 'assets/css',
          outputStyle: 'compressed'
        }
      }
    },

The config for the **compass** plugin is pretty straight-forward. Within
the `options` property you define the directory containing your Sass
files and the directory that you want the compiled CSS to be output to.
The `outputStyle` property allows you to specify how the Sass code
should be compiled. Specifying `compressed` here will output a CSS file
that has been minified.

Next up, lets take a look at the **JSHint** task. If you haven‚Äôt used
[JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) before it‚Äôs a really neat tool for
checking your JavaScript code for errors. It can also be used to help
enforce a style guide so that your code is easily readable to everyone
working on a project.

    jshint: {
      options: {
        jshintrc: '.jshintrc'
      },
      all: ['Gruntfile.js', 'assets/js/*.js']
    }

The `all` property here is used to specify which files should be checked
with JSHint. Again wildcards (\*) have been used here to select all the
JavaScript files in the `assets/js` directory.

You can specify the options that JSHint should run with using the
`options` property. You can either list these directly in the Gruntfile
or extract them out into a `.jshintrc` file. I like to use a `.jshintrc`
file because it‚Äôs easier to maintain.

Here‚Äôs an example of what a simple `.jshintrc` file looks like.

    {
      "node": true,
      "esnext": true,
      "curly": false,
      "smarttabs": true,
      "indent": 2,
      "quotmark": "single",
      "globals": {
        "jQuery": true
      }
    }

* * * * *

**Note**: For a full list of JSHint options check out the
[documentation](http://www.jshint.com/docs/options/).

* * * * *

In this section we‚Äôve only touched on some of the configuration options
for the grunt tasks we‚Äôre using. For more information check out the
documentation for each of the plugins.

-   [Watch
    Documentation](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)
-   [Compass
    Documentation](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compass)
-   [JSHint
    Documentation](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint)

### Loading the Plugins

The next section in the Gruntfile is used for loading each of the
plugins you wish to use. These need to be specified in your
`package.json` file and installed using `npm install`. If you try to run
grunt without installing a plugin it will just display an error.

    // Load the Grunt plugins.
    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-compass');
    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');
    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');

### Registering the Default Tasks

The `grunt.registerTask` method is used specify a default set of tasks
that should run when the `grunt` command is executed.

    // Register the default tasks.
    grunt.registerTask('default', ['watch']);

The first parameter of this method specifies the name of the task (in
this case ‚Äòdefault‚Äô) and the second contains an array of the tasks you
wish to be executed. The `watch` task we defined earlier takes care of
calling the `compass` and `jshint` tasks, so we only need to specify
`watch` here.

Running Grunt
-------------

So all this configuration stuff is great but how do you actually run
grunt?

Executing the `grunt` command in your terminal will run all of the tasks
specified in your `default` task.

You can also run tasks individually by passing the task name to the
`grunt` command.

    grunt           // Runs default tasks
    grunt compass   // Just runs the compass task

Adding New Plugins
------------------

Now that you have an understanding of how to set up and run Grunt, lets
add another plugin that will handle [CSS style
injection](http://css-tricks.com/style-injection-is-for-winners/). This
is a really neat tool that updates the CSS in the browser without
refreshing the page.

Start by installing the `grunt-browser-sync` package. Use the
`--save-dev` flag to automatically update your `package.json` file.

    npm install grunt-browser-sync --save-dev

You then need to load the plugin in your Gruntfile.

    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-browser-sync');

Next add the configuration for the `browser_sync` task to your
Gruntfile. This specifies which CSS files should be injected into the
page. The plugin can also handle images, JavaScript and markup files.
However, these will trigger a full page refresh.

    browser_sync: {
      files: {
        src : [
          'assets/css/*.css',
          'assets/img/*',
          'assets/js/*.js',
          '**/*.html'
        ],
      },
      options: {
        watchTask: true
      }
    },

The `watchTask` option is set to `true` here because we are using the
`watch` plugin. As we are compiling Sass, we need to make sure that the
order in which tasks are executed is correct. Otherwise browser sync
might inject the CSS before the new CSS file has been generated by the
`compass` task.

* * * * *

**Note**: The true power of browser sync becomes apparent when testing a
site across multiple devices. The plugin will do it‚Äôs best to determine
your IP on the network so that syncing works across devices. However, if
you are using custom domains or browser sync isn‚Äôt finding the correct
IP, you can specify your host using the `host` property.

    host: 'treehouse.dev'

* * * * *

Next you need to update the default tasks to include `browser_sync`.

    grunt.registerTask('default', ['browser_sync', 'watch']);

Browser Sync uses
[WebSockets](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/an-introduction-to-websockets)
to send messages to the browser that trigger style injections or full
page refreshes. When you first execute the `grunt` command you will be
given two lines to add to your HTML that will create the WebSocket
connection.

    <script src='http://YOUR_HOST:3000/socket.io/socket.io.js'></script>
    <script src='http://YOUR_HOST:3001/browser-sync-client.min.js'></script>

You‚Äôre done! You should now be able to make updates to your CSS,
JavaScript and markup files and have the changes displayed in the
browser automatically. Not having to manually refresh the browser window
every time you change a file is really nice.

Final Thoughts
--------------

If you‚Äôre looking for ways to improve your workflow Grunt is definitely
a good place to start. Hopefully this blog post has shown you how to get
set up with Grunt and introduced you to some of the plugins that make it
such a great tool.

I held out on using Grunt in my own workflow for quite a while, but as
soon as I tried it out I wished that I had started using it sooner. If
you take a look through the [plugins
directory](http://gruntjs.com/plugins) on the Grunt website you‚Äôll be
sure to find a bunch of things that will help to save you time.

    Really good intro to Grunt.

    Grunt seems like the next step in software dev build tools.\
     First we had batch files, then ant, then maven, now Grunt (I may
    have missed some other build tool).
