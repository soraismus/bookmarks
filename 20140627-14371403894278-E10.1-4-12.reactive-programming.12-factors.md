All my life, I thought ‘reaction’ was a bad word. Ever since the French
Revolution, being ‘reactionary’ could get you into [a lot of
trouble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary). More recently (and
less detrimental to your health and limb count), being in ‘reactionary’
mode is considered merely an anti-pattern. We were all in situations in
life where we felt like we were merely reacting to changes foisted upon
us, like tall grass helplessly flailing on a windy day. We all want to
be the wind, not the grass.

As you could read only everywhere, including [my own blog
post](http://dejanglozic.com/2014/04/07/micro-services-fad-fud-fo-fum/ "Micro-Services – Fad, FUD, Fo, Fum"),
Agile movement has been declared dead (although ‘agility’ is still fine
and dandy, thank you). Being communal people and in need of an idea to
gather around, and not liking the traditional organized religions’ early
hours, we looked for a more suitable replacement.

Not that others were not trying, and even before Agile’s passing. For
example, Adam Wiggins of Heroku extraction has channeled his inner L.
Ron Hubbard by establishing his [Church of 12
Factors](http://12factor.net/) (kudos for pulling it off without one
reference to space ships). It it is chock-full of Cloud-y goodness and
is actually quote good and useful. I think Adam is now beating himself
up for not waiting a bit and slapping ‘micro-services’ all over the
manifest, because that is totally what ’12 factors’ are about.

According to Adam, 12-factor apps:

-   Use **declarative** formats for setup automation, to minimize time
    and cost for new developers joining the project;
-   Have a **clean contract** with the underlying operating system,
    offering **maximum portability** between execution environments;
-   Are suitable for **deployment** on modern **cloud platforms**,
    obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
-   **Minimize divergence** between development and production, enabling
    **continuous deployment** for maximum agility;
-   And can **scale up** without significant changes to tooling,
    architecture, or development practices.

So what went wrong? It is still a worthwhile document, and I keep
revisiting it often, but it lacks the galvanizing force that true
movements have. Maybe there are just too many factors (even actual
religions knew to stop at 10), or maybe because it sounds too much like
inspirational lifestyle articles such as [12 Lifestyle Factors That Make
You Feel
Depressed](http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-12880/12-lifestyle-factors-that-make-you-feel-depressed.html).

Then the Agile thing happened, and it was time to get cracking. It was
not a long wait – behold [The Reactive
Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org).

Now, I make it sound like it all happened in a neat chronological order
(something my buddy [Adrian
Rossouw](https://twitter.com/AdrianRossouw)would organize in a
[Wayfinder
timeline](http://wayfinder.co/pathways/5375e8cd7906431100dbb9b8/angular-js-taught-me-a-lot-about-myself?utm_content=buffer37dca&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)),
but it did not. The first version of the manifesto was published by
Jonas Boner and friends and described on the Typesafe blog in [July
2013](http://typesafe.com/blog/why_do_we_need_a_reactive_manifesto%3F).
It was uploaded to GitHub and the community was invited to help tweak
the document. The current version (1.1) dates September 2013 and is
signed by thousands of believers (I meant ‘supporters’). In Jonas’ own
words, the motivation for putting the manifesto forward was:

> The primary motivation for this manifesto is to come up with a name
> for these new type of applications (similar to NOSQL, Big Data, SOA
> and REST) and to define a common vocabulary for describing them — both
> in terms of business values and technical concepts. Names matter and
> hopefully this will help bring the communities together and make it
> easier for users and vendors to talk about things and understand each
> other.
>
> Up to now the usual way to describe this type of application has been
> to use a mix of technical and business buzzwords; asynchronous,
> non-blocking, real-time, highly-available, loosely coupled, scalable,
> fault-tolerant, concurrent, reactive, event-driven, push instead of
> pull, distributed, low latency, high throughput, etc. This does not
> help communication, quite the contrary, it greatly hinders it.

**The four traits**

In its core, The Reactive Manifesto puts forward four reactive traits a
modern distributed system should possess (notice the small number of key
tenets – that’s how it’s done). Let’s see how these qualities intersect
with the modern micro-service based systems I was writing about in the
last few months:

1.  **Reactive to events** – a modern micro-service based distributed
    system is asynchronous by nature, with each service sitting dormant
    until an event wakes it up. Lest it turns out we are talking REST
    only, a loosely coupled system using some kind of message broker is
    a better fit because it offers further decoupling. Publishing into a
    pub/sub topic does not require any knowledge of the possible
    consumers of the message in a way that A-\>B REST calls do. And of
    course, while the authors of the manifest seem to be coming from the
    Scala background (with Play framework also playing a part), it is
    easy to notice that Node.js is an even better fit. Its asynchronous
    nature ‘all the way down’ ensures non-blocking way of reacting to
    events.
2.  **Reactive to load** – a corollary of the micro-service based system
    is the freedom to scale out each service independently of the rest
    of the system. The ability to instrument the nodes and cluster hot
    spots while living the less popular services as-is is of great help
    in the cloud environments. Cloud resources are finite and cost
    money. Knowing which nodes to cluster (and more importantly, where
    that would be overkill) is essential to arriving at a system that is
    reactive to load while still keeping the monthly bill reasonable.
3.  **Reactive to failure** – when there are many moving parts, failure
    is inevitable. Successful ‘born on the net’ companies with complex
    distributed systems not only guard against failure, they openly
    embrace it (who hasn’t heard about the Netflix’s [Chaos
    Monkey](http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/chaos-monkey-released-into-wild.html)).
4.  **Reactive to users** – this part is a bit confusing. You would
    think that the four reactive traits are like ‘four pillars of
    heaven’ or ‘the four elements’ (minus [Mila
    Jovovic](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/)). As it turns out,
    the previous three reactive properties are preconditions to the
    system being reactive to users – by providing real time, engaging,
    performant user experiences. Being reactive to events, load and
    failure will simply increase your chances to be reactive to users in
    a way that will keep them from leaving in frustration.

**Reactive reactions**

When you research a topic, and the second Google search hit after the
actual topic is “Reactive Manifesto bulls\*\*t”, you cannot resist
clicking on the link. In it, Paul Chiusano
[argues](http://pchiusano.blogspot.ca/2013/11/the-reactive-manifesto-is-not-even-wrong.html)
that Reactive Manifest is not only not right, it’s [not even
wrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong). It looks like the
ultimate insult is being banished into the binary system limbo, where
you are neither right nor wrong, you are, well, nothing (it’s like Louis
CK joke that because he owes $50, he needs to raise $50 just to be
broke).

Of course, there are positive reactions and people who don’t really care
– the usual spectrum.

Here is what I think: I am actually positive about the intent of
Reactive Manifesto. First off, it redefines ‘reactive’ as something
positive. Of course it didn’t invent anything new, but that is not the
first time in history somebody came and put a name on something we were
already doing but didn’t know it. Remember [JJG and
Ajax](http://dejanglozic.com/2013/08/12/pulling-back-from-extreme-ajax/ "Pulling Back from Extreme AJAX")?
He didn’t invent it – he just put a name on a technique that is the
bedrock of any modern client side application. How about
‘micro-services’? Many people fail to see how they are different from
SOA or just plain ‘services’ or ‘distributed systems’ – a lot of haters
in that camp too.

But here is what my first reaction was: coming from a former communist
country, my first association was with a guy whose beard is every
hipster’s dream – Karl Marx. When he and his buddy Engels came forward
with the Communist Manifesto, they didn’t invent alienation, oppression
and capitalism’s seedy underbelly. They just articulated them succinctly
and gave something to millions of disgruntled workers around the world
to rally around. It didn’t turn out all that well in hindsight, but
notice what I am getting at here – manifestos don’t invent new things,
they put a names on concepts, helping the adherents galvanize around
them and form movements.

So to those who say ‘The Reactive Manifesto’ didn’t invent anything new,
you are right: that was not the intention. Go read your history or
Google ‘manifesto’.

**The ‘What, Why, How’ trifecta**

I would like to circle back to ’12 factors’ and ‘micro-services’ and
claim that we now have a fairly complete set of answers to big questions
we may ask while we build modern distributed systems:

1.  **What are we building**? A micro-service based distributed system.
2.  **Why are we building it**? Because we want it to be reactive to
    events, load, failure and users.
3.  **How are we building it**? Using the techniques and recommendations
    outlined in the 12-factors.

There you go – no need to choose one over the other – a simple ’1 + 4 +
12′ formula that will bring you happiness and make you rich.

As for me, I am taking a leaf from the SNL book – I am going to the
first Toronto Reactive Meetup. In fact, I am raising SNL by not only
participating but actually speaking at it – a new era of people
presenting on topics to find out what they are.

If you are in Toronto on June 24, join us – in addition to reading my
musings, you can see me deliver them in full HD.
