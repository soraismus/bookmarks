How to Hire a Programmer
========================

There's no magic bullet for hiring programmers. But I can share advice
on a few techniques that I've seen work, that I've written about here
and personally tried out over the years.

### 1. First, pass a few simple "Hello World" online tests.

I know it sounds crazy, but some people who call themselves programmers
can barely program. To this day, I *still* get regular pings from people
who tell me they had candidates [fail the most basic programming test
imaginable](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html).

That's why *extremely* simple programming tests are [step one of any
sane interview
process](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/02/the-nonprogramming-programmer.html).
These tests should happen online, and the goal is *not* to prove that
the candidate is some kind of coding genius, but that they know what the
heck programming is. Yes, it's sad and kind of depressing that this is
even necessary, but if you don't perform this sanity check, trust me –
you'll be sorry.

Some services that do online code screening (I am sure there are more,
but these are the ones I know about) are [Interview
Zen](http://www.interviewzen.com/) and [codility](http://codility.com/).

### 2. Ask to see their portfolio.

Any programmer worth their salt should [have a portfolio of the things
they've worked
on](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/10/a-programmers-portfolio.html).
It doesn't have to be fancy. I'm just looking for a basic breadcrumb
trail of your awesomeness that you've left on the Internet to help
others. Show me a Stack Overflow profile where I can see what kind of
communicator and problem solver you are. Link me to an open-source code
repository of your stuff. Got a professional blog? A tumblr? A twitter?
Some other word I've never heard of? Excellent, let's have a look. Share
applications you've designed, or websites you worked on, and describe
what parts were yours.

Just seeing what kind of work people have done, and what sort of online
artifacts they've created, is tremendously helpful in getting a sense of
what people do and what they're good (or bad) at.

### 3. Hire for cultural fit.

[Like
GitHub](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2486-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-github),
I find that cultural fit is often a stronger predictor of success than
mad programming chops.

> We talk about [philosophy] during the hiring process, which we take
> very seriously. We want any potential GitHubber to know what they’re

> Early on we made a few hires for their skills with little regard to
> how they’d fit into the culture of the company or if they understood
> the philosophy. Naturally, those hires didn’t work out. So while we
> care about the skills of a potential employees, whether or not they
> “get” us is a major part too.

I realize that not every business *has* a community around what they do,
but **if you do have a community you should try like hell to hire from
your community whenever possible**. These are the folks who were
naturally drawn to what you do, that were pulled into the gravitational
well of your company completely of their own accord. The odds of these
candidates being a good cultural fit are abnormally high. That's what
you want!

Did a few of your users [build an amazing mod for your
game](http://www.mojang.com/2012/02/minecraft-team-strengthened/)? Did
they [find an obscure security vulnerability and try to tell you about
it](http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/03/hacker-commandeers-github-to-prove-vuln-in-ruby.ars?clicked=related_right)?
*Hire these people immediately!*

### 4. Do a detailed, structured phone screen.

Once you've worked through the above, it's time to give the candidate a
call. Bear in mind that the phone screen is not for chatting, it's for
*screening*. The call should be technical and structured, so both of you
can get out immediately if it clearly isn't a fit. [Getting the
Interview Phone Screen
Right](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/01/getting-the-interview-phone-screen-right.html)
covers the basics, but in summary:

1.  A bit of on-the-fly coding. "Find the largest int value in an int
    array."
2.  Some basic design. "Design a representation to model HTML."
3.  Scripting and regular expressions. "Give me a list of the text files
    in this directory that contain phone numbers in a specific format."
4.  Data structures. "When would you use a hashtable versus an array?"
5.  Bits and bytes. "Why do programmers think asking if Oct 31 and Dec
    25 are the same day is funny?"

What you're looking for is not magical perfect answers, necessarily, but
some context into how this person solves problems, and whether they know
their stuff (plus or minus 10 percent). The goal is to make sure that
the candidates that do make it to the next step are not wasting their
time or yours. So don't be shy about sticking to your guns and ending
the call early if there are too many warning flags.

### 5. Give them an audition project.

So the candidate breezed through the hello world programming tests, has
an amazing portfolio, is an excellent cultural fit, and also passed the
phone screen with flying colors. Time to get them in for a face-to-face
interview, right? *Not so fast there cowboy!*

I've seen candidates nail all of the above, join the company, and
utterly fail to Get Things Done. Have I mentioned that hiring
programmers is hard?

If you want to determine beyond the shadow of a doubt if someone's going
to be a great hire, **give them an audition project**. I'm not talking
about a generic, abstract programming problem, I'm talking about **a
real world, honest-to-God unit of work that you need done right now
today on your actual product**. Something you would give to a current
employee, if they weren't all busy, y'know, *doing other stuff*.

This should be a regular consulting gig with an hourly rate, and a
clearly defined project mission statement. Select a small project that
can ideally be done in a few days, maybe at most a week or two. Either
the candidate can come in to the office, or they can work remotely. I
know not every business has these bite-sized units of work that they can
slice off for someone outside the company – but trying desperately to
make it *inside* the company – to take on. I'd argue that if you can't
think of *any* way to make an audition mini-project work for a strong
hiring candidate, perhaps you're not structuring the work properly for
your existing employees, either.

If the audition project is a success, fantastic – you now have a highly
qualified candidate that can provably Get Things Done, *and* you've
accomplished something that needed doing. To date, I have never seen a
candidate who passes the audition project fail to work out. I weigh
performance on the audition project heavily; it's as close as you can
get to actually working the job without being hired. And if the audition
project doesn't work out, well, consider the cost of this little
consulting gig a cheap exit fee compared to an extensive interview
process with 4 or 5 other people at your company. Worst case, you can
pass off the audition project to the next strong candidate.

(A probationary period of conditional employment can also work, and is
conceptually quite similar. You could hire with a 6-8 week review "go or
no go" decision everyone agrees to in advance.)

### 6. Get in a room with us and pitch.

Finally, you should meet candidates face-to-face at some point. It's
inevitable, but the point of the earlier steps is that **you should be
95% certain that a candidate would be a great hire before they ever set
foot in an interview room**.

I'm far from an expert on in person interviews, but [I don't like
interview puzzle
questions](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/03/the-hardest-interview-puzzle-question-ever.html),
to [put it
mildly](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/05/snappy-answers-to-stupid-programming-questions.html).

Instead, I have my own theory about how we should interview programmers:
have the candidate give a 15 minute presentation on their area of
expertise. I think this is a far better indicator of success than a
traditional interview, because you'll quickly ascertain …

-   Is this person passionate about what they are doing?
-   Can they communicate effectively to a small group?
-   Do they have a good handle on their area of expertise?
-   Would your team enjoy working with this person?

The one thing every programmer should know, per Steve Yegge, is [how to
market yourself, your code, and your
project](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/10/the-one-thing-every-software-engineer-should-know.html).
I wholeheartedly agree. *Now pitch me!*

### 7. None of this is guaranteed.

Please take this list at face value. I've seen these techniques work,
and I've occasionally seen them not work. Adapt this advice to your your
particular situation, keep what you think makes sense, and ignore the
rest (although I'd strongly advise you to never, ever skip step \#1).
Even in the best of circumstances, **hiring human beings is hard**. A
job opportunity may not work out for reasons far beyond anyone's
control. People are, as they say, *complicated*.

If you think of work as a relationship, one you'll spend 40 hours a week
(or more) in the rest of your life, it behooves everyone involved to
"date smart". Both the company and the candidate should make a good
faith best effort to determine if there's a match. Your goal shouldn't
be merely to get a job, or hire someone for a job, but to [have
fun](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/remember-this-stuff-is-supposed-to-be-fun.html)
and [create a love
connection](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/12/programming-love-it-or-leave-it.html).
Don't rush into anything unless it feels right on both sides.

can't go wrong with [this excellent advice from Samuel
Mullen](http://samuelmullen.com/2012/02/advice-on-attracting-good-developers/).)
