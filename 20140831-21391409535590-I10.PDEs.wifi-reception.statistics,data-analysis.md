Helmhurts
=========

A few posts back I was concerned with optimising the WiFi reception in
my flat, and I chose a simple method for calculating the distribution of
electromagnetic intensity. I casually mentioned that I really should be
doing things more rigorously by solving the Helmholtz equation, but then
didn’t. Well, spurred on by a shocking amount of spare time, I’ve given
it a go here.

The [Helmholtz
equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_equation) is used in
the modelling of the propagation of electromagnetic waves. More
precisely, if the time-dependence of an electromagnetic wave can be
assumed to be of the form ![\\sin(\\omega
t)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%28%5Comega+t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\sin(\omega t)")
and the dispersion relation given by ![\\omega =
ck/n(x)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega+%3D+ck%2Fn%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\omega = ck/n(x)")
for some refractive index distribution
![n(x)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n(x)"),
then the electric field
![E](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "E")
solves

![\\nabla\^2E + \\frac{k\^2}{n\^2}E = f(x)
](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla%5E2E+%2B+%5Cfrac%7Bk%5E2%7D%7Bn%5E2%7DE+%3D+f%28x%29+&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "\nabla^2E + \frac{k^2}{n^2}E = f(x) ")

where
![f(x)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "f(x)")
is some source function. Given a source of radiation and a geometry to
propagate in, in principle the Helmholtz equation can be solved for the
entire radiation field
![E(x,y,z)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "E(x,y,z)").
In practice this may not be so simple. Here I chose to model a situation
in 2D, and set up a computational grid of size ![N \\times
M](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N+%5Ctimes+M&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "N \times M")
with grid cells labelled
![(i,j)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2Cj%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "(i,j)")
for ![1 < i <
N](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%3C+i+%3C+N&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "1 < i < N"),
![1 < j <
M](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%3C+j+%3C+M&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "1 < j < M").
Given this discretisation, the equation above becomes

![\\frac{E(i+1,j) + E(i-1,j) - 2E(i,j)}{\\Delta x\^2} + \\frac{E(i,j+1)
+ E(i,j-1) - 2E(i,j)}{\\Delta y\^2} + \\frac{k\^2}{n(i,j)\^2}E(i,j) =
f(i,j).](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7BE%28i%2B1%2Cj%29+%2B+E%28i-1%2Cj%29+-+2E%28i%2Cj%29%7D%7B%5CDelta+x%5E2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7BE%28i%2Cj%2B1%29+%2B+E%28i%2Cj-1%29+-+2E%28i%2Cj%29%7D%7B%5CDelta+y%5E2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7Bk%5E2%7D%7Bn%28i%2Cj%29%5E2%7DE%28i%2Cj%29+%3D+f%28i%2Cj%29.&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=2 "\frac{E(i+1,j) + E(i-1,j) - 2E(i,j)}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{E(i,j+1) + E(i,j-1) - 2E(i,j)}{\Delta y^2} + \frac{k^2}{n(i,j)^2}E(i,j) = f(i,j).")

This is a linear equation in the ‘current’ cell
![E(i,j)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%28i%2Cj%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "E(i,j)")
as a function of its 4 neighbours. Each cell has an equation describing
the relationship with its neighbours, so there are
![NM](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=NM&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "NM")
equations in
![NM](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=NM&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "NM")
unknowns. This motivates a linear algebraic approach to the problem – if
all equations can be represented as one giant matrix equation, that
matrix can be inverted and an exact solution for
![E](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "E")
recovered. In particular we’ll have ![\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{E} =
\\mathbf{f}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BM%7D%5Cmathbf%7BE%7D+%3D+%5Cmathbf%7Bf%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbf{M}\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{f}")
for some matrix
![\\mathbf{M}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BM%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbf{M}"),
and we can compute ![\\mathbf{E} =
\\mathbf{M}\^{-1}\\mathbf{f}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BE%7D+%3D+%5Cmathbf%7BM%7D%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cmathbf%7Bf%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{M}^{-1}\mathbf{f}").\
 This is slightly tricky due to the fact that a 2D labelling system
![(i,j)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2Cj%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "(i,j)")
needs to be converted to a 1D labelling system
![n](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n"), as
the 2D simulation domain needs to be converted to a 1D vector. I use the
translation that ![n = M(i-1)
+j](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D+M%28i-1%29+%2Bj&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n = M(i-1) +j")
so that

![(1,1) \\rightarrow 1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ (1,M) \\rightarrow M \\\\ (2,1)
\\rightarrow M+1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ (N,M) \\rightarrow
NM.](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2C1%29+%5Crightarrow+1+%5C%5C++%5Cvdots+%5C%5C++%281%2CM%29+%5Crightarrow+M+%5C%5C++%282%2C1%29+%5Crightarrow+M%2B1+%5C%5C++%5Cvdots+%5C%5C++%28N%2CM%29+%5Crightarrow+NM.&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "(1,1) \rightarrow 1 \\  \vdots \\  (1,M) \rightarrow M \\  (2,1) \rightarrow M+1 \\  \vdots \\  (N,M) \rightarrow NM.")

A pair of cells
![(i,j)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2Cj%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "(i,j)")
and
![(i+1,j)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2B1%2Cj%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "(i+1,j)")
are then separated by
![M](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "M") in
this new labelling system, and a pair of cells
![(i,j+1))](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2Cj%2B1%29%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "(i,j+1))")
and
![(i,j)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2Cj%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "(i,j)")
separated by 1.\
 The row in the matrix equation corresponding to the
![(i,j)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2Cj%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "(i,j)")th
cell looks like

where there are
![M](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "M")
blank cells between the ![1/\\Delta
x\^2](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F%5CDelta+x%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "1/\Delta x^2")
and ![1/\\Delta
y\^2](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F%5CDelta+y%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "1/\Delta y^2")
cells. In fact, it is clear that the vast majority of the matrix is
zero, which can help when considering the sheer size of the matrix. For
this problem a room is approximately 5 m across, and the wavelength to
resolve is around 5 cm. We will require ![N \>
500](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N+%3E+500&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "N > 500")
or so then, which means the number of elements is around
![10\^{10}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B10%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "10^{10}")!
Storing each as a single precision number would require around 60 GB of
RAM, and my poor battered laptop wouldn’t have a chance inverting that
matrix even if it would fit in memory.\
 Fortunately this problem has crept up on people cleverer than I, and
they invented the concept of the sparse matrix, or a matrix filled
mostly with zeros. We can visualise the structure of our matrix using
the handy Matlab function spy – as plotted below it shows which elements
of the matrix are nonzero.

[![Sparse](http://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/sparse1.png?w=1200)](https://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/sparse1.png)

Here ![NM =
28](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=NM+%3D+28&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "NM = 28"),
so there are 784 elements in the matrix. However only 64 of those are
nonzero, just 8% of the matrix is actually useful in computation! This
drops to 4% if the resolution of our grid jumps by a factor of 10, and
stays around 5% for another factor of 10. There is a special data
structure in Matlab for sparse matricies, and using it speeds up
calculation of inverses by orders of magnitude. In this case the code is
literally a hundred times faster and uses a fraction of the memory.\
 Moving on to the physics then, what does a solution of the Helmholtz
equation look like? On the unit square for large
![k](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "k"),
the quickest way is actually to use a packet of rice – see e.g.
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJAgrUBF4w).\
 In this calculation I’ve set boundary conditions that ![E =
0](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E+%3D+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "E = 0")
on the edges of the square, and set ![f(x,y) =
\\delta(x,y)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+%5Cdelta%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "f(x,y) = \delta(x,y)").
It turns out that the Helmholtz equation can also be applied to the
modelling of the forced vibrations of the square plate, where the choice
of conditions above equates to applying a force at the centre of the
plate and clamping the edges. The rice/sand/etc settles at the nodes of
the plate, i.e. the positions which stay stationary in the oscillation.\
 Visualised below are a selected few pretty pictures where I’ve taken a
logarithmic colour scale to highlight the positions of zero electric
field – the ‘nodes’. As the animation proceeds
![k](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "k")
starts high and gradually gets lower, corresponding to fast plate
oscillations gradually getting slower.

[![Plates](http://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/plates.gif?w=1200)](https://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/plates.gif)

Once again physics has turned out unexpectedly pretty and distracted me
away from my goal, and this post becomes a microcosm of the entire
concept of the blog…\
 Moving onwards, I’ll recap the layout of the flat where I’m hoping to
improve the signal reaching my computer from my WiFi router:

[![Flat\_layout](http://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/flat_layout.png?w=1200)](http://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/flat_layout.png)

I can use this image to act as a refractive index map – walls are very
high refractive index, and empty space has a refractive index of 1. I
then set up the WiFi antenna as a small radiation source hidden away
somewhat uselessly in the corner. Starting with a radiation wavelength
of 10 cm, I end up with an electromagnetic intensity map which looks
like this:

[![RouterActualHelmholtz](http://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/routeractualhelmholtz.png?w=1200&h=666)](https://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/routeractualhelmholtz.png)

This is, well, surprisingly great to look at, but is very much
unexpected. I would have expected to see some region of ‘brightness’
around the electromagnetic source, fading away into the distance perhaps
with some funky diffraction effects going on. Instead we get a wispy
structure with filaments of strong field strength snaking their way
around. There are noticeable black spots too, recognisable to anyone
who’s shifted position in a chair and having their phone conversation
dropped.

What if we stuck the router in the kitchen?

[![RouterKitchenHelmholtz](http://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/routerkitchenhelmholtz.png?w=1200&h=666)](https://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/routerkitchenhelmholtz.png)

This seems to help the reception in all of the flat except the bedrooms,
though we would have to deal with lightning striking the cupboard under
the stairs it seems.

What about smack bang in the middle of the flat?

[![RouterMiddleHelmholtz](http://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/routermiddlehelmholtz.png?w=1200&h=666)](https://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/routermiddlehelmholtz.png)

Thats more like it! Tendrils of internet goodness can get everywhere,
even into the bathroom where *no one at all* occasionally reads BBC News
with numb legs. Unfortunately this is probably not a viable option.

Actually the distribution of field strength seems extremely sensitive to
every parameter, be it the position of the router, the wavelength of the
radiation, or the refractive index of the front door. This probably
requires some averaging over parameters or grid convergence scan, but
given it takes this laptop 10 minutes or so to conjure up each of the
above images, that’s probably out of the question for now.

**UPDATE**

As suggested by a helpful commenter, I tried adding in an imaginary
component of the refractive index for the walls, taken from
[here](http://web.mit.edu/istgroup/ist/documents/1998_EM%20properties%20of%20concrete%20at%20microwave%20freq%20range_HCR%20&%20OB.pdf).
This allows for some absorption in the concrete, and stops the perfect
reflections forming a standing wave which almost perfectly cancels
everything out. The results look like something I would actually expect:

[![Damping](http://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/damping.gif?w=1200)](https://jasmcole.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/damping.gif)

**END UPDATE**

It’s quite surprising that the final results should be so sensitive, but
given we’re performing a matrix inversion in the solution, the field
strength at every position depends on the field strength at every other
position. This might seem to be invoking some sort of non-local
interaction of the electromagnetic field, but actually its just due to
the way we’ve decided to solve the problem.

The Helmholtz equation implicitly assumes a solution independent of
time, other than a sinusoidal oscillation. What we end up with is then a
system at equilibrium, oscillating back and forth as a trapped standing
wave. In effect the antenna has been switched on for an infinite amount
of time and all possible reflections, refractions, transmissions etc.
have been allowed to happen. There is certainly enough time for all
parts of the flat to affect every other part of the flat then, and
‘non-locality’ isn’t an issue. In a practical sense, after a second the
electromagnetic waves have had time to zip around the place billions of
times and so equilibrium happens extremely quickly.

Now it’s all very well and good to chat about this so glibly, because
we’re all physicists and 90% of the time we’re rationalising away
difficult-to-do things as ‘obvious’ or ‘trivial’ to avoid doing any
work. Unfortunately for me the point of this blog is to do lots of work
in my spare time while avoiding doing anything actually useful, so lets
see if we can’t have a go at the time-dependent problem. Once we start
reintroducing
![d/dt](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2Fdt&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "d/dt")‘s
into the Helmholtz equation it’s actually not an approximation at all
any more and we’re back to solving the full set of Maxwell’s equations.

This is exactly what the FDTD technique achieves – Finite Difference
Time Domain. The FD means we’re solving equations on a grid, and the TD
just makes it all a bit harder. To be specific there is a simple
algorithm to march Maxwell’s equations forwards in time, namely

![E\_x(t + \\Delta t) = E\_x(t) + \\frac{\\Delta

I’ve introduced a current source
![I](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "I") and
the relative permittivity/permeability
![\\epsilon](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\epsilon")
and
![\\mu](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\mu")
such that ![c/n =
1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon\\mu}](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%2Fn+%3D+1%2F%5Csqrt%7B%5Cepsilon%5Cmu%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "c/n = 1/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}").
We can use all of the machinery mentioned above to discretise the flat
layout into a grid, but this time repeatedly apply the above equations.
All 6 variables are stored on the grid and updated for every time step.
The RAM requirements aren’t so strict in this case which would allow me
to model the full flat down to millimetre resolution, but this is just
too slow. A full simulation might take all day, and even I can’t justify
that. Running one at a longer wavelength ![\\lambda =
](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+%3D+&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "\lambda = ")
30cm allows me to drop the resolution enough to run a quick simulation
before I go to bed.

With the router in approximately the correct place, you can see the
radiation initially stream out of the router. There are a few
reflections at first, but once the flat has been filled with field it
becomes static quite quickly, and settles into an oscillating standing
wave. This looks very much like the ‘infinite time’ Helmholtz solution
above, albeit at a longer wavelength, and justifies some of the
hand-waving ‘intuition’ I tried to fool you with.

    Hey! Nice simulation, here is a numerical suggestion. Instead of
    computing M\^{-1} and multiplying, you can solve ME=f directly by
    using a linear-systems-of-equation solver. It avoids calculating the
    inverse!

        I’ve been pointed to lsolve() in Matlab, I’ll give it a go and
        hopefully things will speed up nicely. Cheers.

    There is a small mistake in the translation from the 2D labeling
    system to the 1D system, it should be n = M(i-1) + j instead of
    (M-1)i + j. This way the mapping (N,M) -\> NM actually works

    Great article! Please make a web service out of that, where one can
    draw the walls and have the optimal router position computed!

        Thanks! That would be excellent, but perhaps unfeasible at the
        moment. While it makes nice pictures, the code as it stands
        doesn’t use accurate values for the different refractive
        indicies of walls, windows, doors etc. It’s also only 2D and
        doesn’t include the full spectrum of the WiFi radiation. For a
        full model I suspect these things would have to be included, but
        who knows, perhaps I should experimentally map the field
        strength myself and see how accurate this is?

        That’s for another time though…

            Please please please do this. This is a service you could

            and you can probably find details of their effect on
            electromagnetic radiation online already.

            My office has 25 access points, placed with guestimation and
            there are plenty of dark spots! This would really help us

            I’ve just done some rudimentary analysis for kicks due to me
            not being able to explain to my now former office suite
            landlord in any way possible that 800ft\^2 of coverage,
            between old impenetrable red brick walls, off a 2.4ghz
            802.11n router, with an antediluvian dedicated 7mbps DSL
            connection, for 15-20 devices–yes, this is something that
            even I cannot “fix”.

            I will say this, however, and that is I was able to stream
            1080P 30sec clip off youtube on two devices simultaneously.
            I rewired the RJ-11 plug and fit the wall with a cat jack,
            split the neighboring suites RG-6 that had a piping hot
            7mbps dedicated broadband line. then used SSTP/SFTP cat6a
            cable to the router. So I sort of committed a crime but i
            think you get my point–there’s limitations in data
            transmission and in the realm of network alchemy we’ve yet
            to turn bonded DSL into an optical signal.

            Now i’d be curious to see if you’d get any improvements
            using this cable from your modem to the router. I’ve not
            done any packet analysis (i have a life sort of) but holy
            smokes this stuff was like $250 for a 1000′ spool and I’m
            currently running this crap all over my house because the
            performance increase in high interference areas was visibly
            evident compared to a non SFTP ordinary cat5e. lightyears
            better than the phone line that was going into the same
            router. something to mull on. what a lot of people neglect
            to understand is their goddamned wireless peripherals
            (logitech especially) can cause more timeouts, dropped
            connections, and general data connectivity pademonium. But
            yeah this post is fresh2death. And yeah it almost does look
            like work.

            Interesting to see the mathematics used to calculate optimal
            placement. There are many free programs that will
            dynamically map RSSI, SNR and interference to floor plans
            which give you a realtime view of coverage. Example; wifi
            explorer, wifi analyzer, ‎Xirrus Wi-Fi Inspector, any Cisco
            Meraki wireless access point

    Would the waves permeate through doors but not walls? I feel like
    basing this off reflections from walls only and no wall permeability
    is a bit rough. In saying that I think this is fantastic!

        This is all rather rough, mainly meant as a proof of principle.
        At the moment I’m reading in refractive index values from a
        bitmap for the grid, it should be pretty simple to add in some
        varying permeability by ‘painting’ the doors/windows etc. a
        different shade of gray. Thanks for the comment.

        it already exists, Arubanetworks has a product called visualRF
        that does just this

            Seems that Mathworks has included the capability whereby
            Matlab code can be spat out as C, leading to the possibility
            of a smartphone app for data collection about positions of
            objects (and possibly, signal-strength data collection that
            could help estimation of parameters such as transmissivity),
            even, perhaps computation of the paths themselves, as recent
            devices have some killer math capabilities.

            It also makes me wonder whether circularly-polarized
            signals, since antennas for it naturally ignore the first
            reflection, wouldn’t be much better for work in the type of
            tortured space we live in.

            Finally, MIMO would seem to be no better at covering
            genuinely dead spots, but could goose up signal levels in
            marginal areas, making all this mostly academic. Have you
            had experience with it?

            The code is simple enough to write in C, I just worry that
            inverting a large matrix will eat up too much RAM – it
            spikes to a few GB on my laptop. I’m experimenting with
            iterative methods which are much less memory hungry, or
            maybe representing the matrix in block diagonal form, in
            which case the inverse can be computed ‘piecewise’.\
             Unfortunately I’m not an expert on this so I can’t really
            comment on the practical side, but its been interesting to
            come into contact with people who are. Cheers.

            That would be awesome. I’m currently building a house, and
            I’ve planned the location of my router, but I’d love to see
            if it’s optimal or not, so I can change it before I run the

    The images / sensitivity indicate that you have high-Q resonances,
    so probably the refractive index for the walls is too high. They are
    probably much closer to 1, with a small imaginary component, than
    the first model.

        Thanks, I’ll try that. I must admit, I forgot that I could

        I think that’s the key. From here:

        [http://web.mit.edu/istgroup/ist/documents/1998\_EM%20properties%20of%20concrete%20at%20microwave%20freq%20range\_HCR%20&%20OB.pdf](http://web.mit.edu/istgroup/ist/documents/1998_EM%20properties%20of%20concrete%20at%20microwave%20freq%20range_HCR%20&%20OB.pdf)

        I plugged in some actually sensible values and things look much
        more reasonable. Thanks!

        Hi Stefan, I wrote the script in Matlab, I’ll consider posting
        it once cleaned up a bit. As for documentation, well that just
        came from my rapidly fading undergraduate physics I’m afraid.
        The mathematical and computational techniques are very standard
        and will be documented thoroughly in any numerical methods
        textbook.

    Absolutely amazing work. My company works on Wi-Fi engineering and
    deployments. While we have tools that provide heat maps, I think
    there would be much more value in having a tool that shows RF
    behavior. I would be interested to see the same simulation with
    multiple AP’s and perhaps at 5 GHz. Brilliant!!!!!

    \>More precisely, if the time-dependence of an electromagnetic wave
    can be assumed to be of the form sin(wt)

    I think here you make a serious mistake. It implies that the time
    phase is uniform in the apartment. The standard implication is that
    the time dependence is exp(Iwt) and you search for a complex E(x)
    solution.

        Apologies, I intended to write the article for a layman audience
        and so avoided complex numbers at the beginning. Of course, then
        I couldn’t help myself and a did a bit more maths throughout.
        What I actually did was, as you suggest, assume factorisation of
        e\^{iwt) and solve for complex E(x,y).

    If you’re interested in exploring other ways to solve this problem,
    I’d suggest rewriting your problem in [block matrix
    notation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_matrix) You should end
    up with a block tridigonal problem. The “big dimension” ends up
    being trivial to solve using e.g. Gaussian elimination. The “block
    matrix” elements are non-sparse, and so can be solved efficiently
    using ordinary Matlab matrix notation.

    [This might be a useful
    resource](http://www4.ncsu.edu/eos/users/w/white/www/white/ma580/chap2.5.PDF)
    for explaining that.

        I’m not at my flat right now, but that would be very
        interesting! There’s also some evidence that the orientation of
        the receiving antenna matters quite a bit, perhaps motivating a
        full 3D approach.

            I would consider an antenna oriented perfectly vertical. 3D
            approach would mean calculations so long you will have
            changed furniture by then.\
             Also, your calculations are very nice (the idea, I haven’t
            checked the physics) but keep in mind another (maybe even
            more important) element: other networks.\
             Of course they affect especially the placement of the
            receiver and not the placement of the emitter, but still
            it’s worth mentioning it somewhere.

    Very interesting work. However I suspect that your assumption of a
    sine wave is strongly overestimating the interferences pattern (seen
    in radial direction around the source due to the wave reflected by
    the not-so-absorbing nearest wall). The actual wifi signal is phase
    modulated and so i believe that mostly the direct “time of flight”
    signal between the emitter and the receptor needs to be considered.
    The “wifi signal” won’t be necessary be the one with the highest
    amplitude but the one with the correct phase shift sequence. I am
    not an engineer but only physicist… so i guess the actual data
    processing is much more elaborated than that but a signal with a
    variable phase shift will not have such strong interferences
    patterns. Moreover concrete is relatively transparent to microwaves.
    Worth some more thinking !

    I don’t know that you could really calculate it, but polarization
    will have a lot to do with your signal strength at the computer. If
    the antennas are cross polarized with the received signal you can
    lose \~3dB all other things being equal. Might be fun for another
    day?

    I just fold a piece of kitchen foil, shiny side as reflective
    surface, in the entrance of areas that have low wifi signal and
    bounce it just a little further, round corners etc. no calculations
    just a bit of guestimate/common sense in relation to the path the
    wifi signal travels from the router to where I need more signal.
    Works fine for me and can be used as a temporary or a permanant
    solution as required.

    [http://www.overclockers.com.au/](http://www.overclockers.com.au/)

    led me to this blog.

    Using “Wifi Manager” (Android), I could measure real-time signal
    strengths.

    It varies as well, by:\
     1) orientation of the receiver’s aerial (my smartphone) as an
    angle, or front-back-side orientation, relative to the transmitter’s
    aerials.\
     2) if any metal objects (earthed, powered, or not?) are in the
    surfaces between the two aerials.\
     3) the “amount” of mass between the two aerials; one “innocent”
    wall totally parallel to the two aerials is the biggest block (no
    air spaces!)\
     4) brand & type of transmitter; discovered when my
    wireless-router-modem needed replacing.

    From Australia …

    Hmm, my calculus skills are not that great (though I am a
    professional programmer, go figure). Anyway, I am really tempted to
    try turning this into into a computer algorithm that is run in
    Python, Ruby, or Go just to make it so that anyone can run it on
    their home setup.

    I just need to figure out the best way to make this into an
    algorithm in my computer (again, the calculus is weak with me).
    Complex computational math is not something I have ever really
    tried.

    Great work. Now take the whole thing and make it comprehensible to a
    mildly numerate psychologist .As regards WiFi placement I should
    avoid intervening walls and put the transmitter in a central
    position for greatest coverage? And never waste time on BBC online?
    Have you a mnemonic for all that? (Great stuff).

    imperfect state (no accounting for windows, 2d only, etc) this would

    release the source code so other people can have fun with it and
