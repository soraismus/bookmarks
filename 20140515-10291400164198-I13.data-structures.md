Trees as graphs vs. Trees as data structures
============================================

Helping students prepare to get a job is a really important part of what Code Fellows does. Part of this is acing the technical interview, so we spend a lot of time practicing white-boarding with algorithmic problems that our students can be confident when faced with similar questions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\

I have seen students hone their skills by borrowing copies of the
developer interview books in the Code Fellows "library." What's
interesting about these books is that they lump questions about graphs
and trees into the same chapter.

Technically, trees *are* graphs. But if you want to show you know what
you are talking about during an interview, you need to know when being a
graph is important, and when it's not. (And, maybe, just maybe, you
might actually find some of this stuff useful in your career.)

\

Trees from graphs
-----------------

Graphs come out of mathematics and are used to describe or model
problems. For example, if we wanted to model finding a route for walking
from Code Fellows to the foot of the Space Needle, we could represent
this using a graph.

A *graph* is a mathematical structure consisting of a set *V* of
vertices, and a set *E* of edges, each of which is a pair of vertices.

Our graph of South Lake Union would have a vertex for each place that we
have a choice of direction, e.g. outside the Code Fellows door and at
each intersection. An edge between two vertices represents the fact that
we can walk from one location to the other.

Selecting just part of Seattle to make a graph that covers roads from
Code Fellows (yellow) to the Space Needle (blue) gives us 106 vertices
and 172 edges.

![The graph is a grid, except near Seattle Center where roads are
diagonal.](https://dgosxlrnzhofi.cloudfront.net/custom_page_images/production/146/page_images/slu-graph-trees.jpg?1398894725)

This graph shows us how we can walk between different locations
represented by the vertices.

A chain of vertices connected by edges is called a *path*, and the way
we constructed the graph means that a route on the map is a path in the
graph.

The problem of finding a path from one vertex to another is solved using
a graph *traversal*, which is a systematic way of visiting the vertices
of a graph.

In our example, we want to find a path from the yellow vertex (Code
Fellows) to the blue vertex (the Space Needle), so our traversals will
start at the yellow vertex and explore the graph until we reach the the
blue one.

The first traversal, called Breadth First Search (BFS), visits all
neighbors of each vertex before moving on to another vertex. We do this
by holding the vertices to visit in a queue.

    BFS(G, s) {
      for each vertex v in G {
        state[v] = unvisited;
        parent[v] = null;
      };

      state[s] = visited;
      queue.enqueue(s);

      while (queue not empty) {
        u = queue.dequeue();
        process(u);
        for each vertex v in neighbor(u) {
          processEdge(u,v);
          if (state[v] == unvisited) {
            state[v] == visited;
            parent[v] = u;
            queue.enqueue(v);
          }
        }
      }
    }

The other, called Depth First Search (DFS), follows a chain of vertices
until it cannot go further, at which point it backs up. Instead of using
a queue, DFS is based on a stack, which means we can just use the call
stack with a recursive version:

    DFS(G,u) {
      state[u] = visited;
      process(u);
      for each v in neighbors(u) {
        processEdge(u,v);
        if (state[v] == unvisited) {
          parent[v] = u;
          DFS(G,v);
        }
      }
    }

Each of these traversals visits the vertices of the graph in a
prescribed way so that we visit the unvisited neighbors of the current
vertex. This gives us a tree (which is captured by the `parent` array in
our pseudo-code).

A *tree* is a graph that has no cycles (a *cycle* being a path in the
graph that starts and ends at the same vertex).

For instance, in our graph there are a lot of paths that could start and
end at the yellow vertex—one represents going out the door, turning left
and then taking a left at each intersection until you are back on Boren
and at the door again.

Because the traversals ask *have I been here?* before visiting a vertex,
they each construct a tree as they traverse the graph as shown below.

![BFS builds a shorter,shaggier tree, while DFS builds a tree that is a
path with few
branches](https://dgosxlrnzhofi.cloudfront.net/custom_page_images/production/145/page_images/bfs-dfs-trees.jpg?1398894680)

These trees show us the difference between BFS and DFS: BFS methodically
visits the three casting a wide net for the search, while DFS runs
through the graph following a single path until it either finds what it
is looking for or has to backtrack. In this particular problem –
searching the graph for any path – DFS can be faster, but it is possible
to take the wrong turns and visit the full graph when a shorter path
might exist.

For this reason, in Artificial Intelligence, modified versions of these
strategies have been developed to solve graph search problems.

These trees are subgraphs of the original graph, and because our problem
is really to search for a particular vertex in the graph, they may not
actually include all of the vertices in the graph.

However, a tree that does include all of the vertices is called a
*spanning tree*, and these trees are the basis of other kinds of
computational problems.

\

Trees as data structures
------------------------

We use trees all the time to define data structures as implementations
of abstract data types (ADTs) or as the basis for algorithms.

For sets/dictionaries/indexes we have binary search trees, 2-3 trees,
B-trees and relatives; for priority queues we have heaps (a form of
binary tree); and for pattern matching we have tries and suffix trees.

We *are* concerned about properties of the tree as a graph, but only
because they affect the efficiency of the operations on the tree.

For instance, the length of the paths from the root of a binary search
tree to each leaf should be minimized, which happens when the tree is
balanced. But, the fact that two binary search trees, where one is
balanced and the other is not, are effectively the same, has nothing to
do with the properties of the tree as a graph, and everything to do with
how the data is organized within the tree.

(Still not with me? Read up on [splay
trees](http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/splay/) and ponder how a splay tree's
graphiness is important.)

When we are thinking about trees in data structures, graphs rarely come
up. In the mathematical sense, these trees are graphs, but it is helpful
to keep the idea of trees as graphs and trees as data structures
separate in your head.

Learning more
-------------

In the long run, you are going to want to be able to solve problems
beyond the interview, and for that I recommend going beyond interview
books.

There are a lot of good books andresources for data structures and
algorithms—most of which are tailored to a particular programming
language.

One of my favorites, which is not tailored this way, is the [Algorithm
Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com) by Steven Skiena. The book and
website are both good resources on algorithms for graph (and other)
problems, and one of the first places I go to remind myself of how to
approach a problem.
