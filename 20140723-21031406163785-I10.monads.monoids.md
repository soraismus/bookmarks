Even though a monad *is* a monoid in the category of endofunctors, they
look very different when used in functional programming. That's because
monoids are represented as types and endofunctors are represented as
type constructors of a particular typeclass. They operate at different
levels of abstraction. \
\
A categorical monoid is a category that contains a single object, so all
the morphisms loop back onto this object. Because it's a category, there
must be a unit morphism and the composition of morphisms is
automatically associative. \
\
You can *represent* a monoid as a set, with elements corresponding to
original monoid morphisms. In this set, what looked like composition of
morphisms in a category, looks like "multiplication": a function that
takes two elements and produces a third. And this is how monoids are
represented in Haskell. They are types (think, sets) that contain a unit
element,

    mempty

, and support multiplication (or

    mappend

).\
\

    1
    2
    3

    class Monoid a where

      mempty :: a

      mappend :: a -> a -> a

\
\
A functor is a (structure preserving) mapping of categories, and an
endofunctor is a mapping of a category onto itself. Endofunctors form a
kind of monoid with multiplication subsumed by composition. A "product"
of two endofunctors F and G is their composition, F.G. The unit is the
identity functor I, and functor composition is naturally associative. \
\
A (structure preserving) mapping between functors is also well defined
and it's called a natural transformation. It so happens that, if you
look at endofunctors as objects and their natural transformations as
morphisms, you get a category. \
\
If you pick an endofunctor, say T, its powers form a one-dimensional
free monoid. You have I, the identity functor, the zeroth power; and
then T, T.T, T.T.T, and so on. \
\
A monad is an endofunctor T equipped with two natural transformations η
and μ (see [Mort Yao](/Mort-Yao)'s answer). η maps I to T and μ maps T.T
to T. So μ reduces the square of T down to T. One of the monadic axioms
makes sure that the natural transformation that can reduce any power of
T down to T is uniquely defined. For instance, if you have T.T.T, it
doesn't matter if you reduce the first two Ts using μ , and then reduce
the result using μ; or reduce the last two Ts first, and so on. \
\
This way you get a family of natural transformations from powers of T
down to T, starting with η : I-\>T, id: T -\> T, μ : T.T -\> T, and so
on. These natural transformations form a monoid. That's the monoid
equivalent to the monad.\
\
But in Haskell, we represent natural transformations as polymorphic
functions (the components of categorical natural transformations). So η
becomes

    return :: a -> m a

, and μ becomes

    join :: m m a -> m a

, where

    m

is the endofunctor. The monoidal structure of a monad is thus hidden
from view.
