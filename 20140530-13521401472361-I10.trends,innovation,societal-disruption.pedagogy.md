The Future Of Online Ed Isn't Heading Where You Expect

A new pioneer has just planted its flag on the ed-tech frontier: the
country of Trinidad and Tobago. Its government this week announced the
creation of a ["national knowledge network"](https://knowledge.tt/) to
promote free online learning in partnership with [Khan
Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and
[Coursera](http://coursera.org/). The initiative is part of a broader
national strategy of investment in education. The currently oil- and
gas-dependent Caribbean nation is trying to transform itself into a
knowledge economy. For observers of ed tech, meanwhile, the news
represents a possible future path for massive open online courses, or
MOOCs — not as a replacement for a college degree but as a resource for
hybrid and lifelong learning, made in the USA and exported around the
world.

Visitors to [knowledge.tt](https://knowledge.tt/) will find a curated
selection of video-based courses, divided into categories like
"entrepreneurship" and "creativity." For some of these courses,
Trinidadians will also be able to go to their local campus of the
University of Trinidad and meet in person with a facilitator as well as
with others taking the same course. It's a global version of the flipped
classroom, where the lecture may have been recorded at Vanderbilt or
Rice, but the class discussion is unfolding thousands of miles away.
Coursera calls this the ["Learning
Hub"](http://blog.coursera.org/post/65596539008/introducing-coursera-learning-hubs-global)
model. There are currently Learning Hubs located at embassies, libraries
and universities on five continents.

So, what's really new here? Well, this Trinidad and Tobago effort takes
the level of coordination up a notch. Their focus is on connecting
MOOC-powered learning to jobs. Graduates from Learning Hub programs will
receive a government-issued certificate of participation from
knowledge.tt. They'll also be eligible for an internship program with
more than 400 participating employers. This edgy strategy is part of a
larger trend of the nation investing hugely in education. Since 2010,
education has received the highest budgetary allocation of all
government ministries, representing 18 percent of the country's annual
expenditure and 6 percent of GDP (above the U.S., at 5.4 percent of
GDP). Trinidad and Tobago spent $250 million last year on classroom
laptops alone.

Meanwhile, in the bigger picture, scholars and the big development
agencies like the World Bank and UNESCO are increasingly interested in
the potential of MOOCs to open up education in the developing world.
["MOOCs for Development"](http://www.moocs4d.org/) was the topic of a
conference at the University of Pennsylvania just last month with over
25 countries in attendance, and the U.N. is holding a forum on a similar
topic next month.
