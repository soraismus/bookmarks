Lisp Types Demystified (Part II: Linear Random Access Sequences)
================================================================

By Robert Smith, on June 6th, 2013

This is the Part II in the series of Lisp Types Demystified. There is no
logical dependence on the retroactively dubbed [Part
I](http://symbo1ics.com/blog/?p=1495), but it sets the stage a bit.

In this post, I will briefly outline a framework for type equivalence
and subtyping, describe a range of compound types, and then focus on one
of the most complex types in Lisp, the one-dimensional `simple-array`,
which is the foundation for many of the one-dimension types, such as
vectors, strings, and bit vectors.

Types and Subtypes
------------------

A **type** in Common Lisp is a specifier that denotes a set of objects.
Let $V(\\tau)$ denote the set of *all* possible objects that the type
$\\tau$ can represent. For example, for the type specifier `integer`, we
have \\[V(\\mathtt{integer}) = \\{\\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2,
\\ldots\\}.\\]

A **subtype** $\\sigma$ of type $\\tau$, written $\\sigma :\\leq \\tau$,
means that all of the values represented by $\\sigma$ are also a part
of, or possibly the same as, those represented by $\\tau$.
Mathematically, \\[\\sigma :\\leq \\tau \\iff V(\\sigma) \\subseteq
V(\\tau).\\]

Type Equality
-------------

Types $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ are equal if and only if they have exactly
the same objects. **It is *not* sufficient for there to simply be any
bijection.** Mathematically, \\[\\sigma = \\tau \\iff V(\\sigma) =
V(\\tau).\\]

Compound Types
--------------

Common Lisp has a notion of compound types. A **compound type** is a
type parameterized by other types, values, or a special specifier called
*asterisk* or $\*$. For example, \\[V(\\mathtt{(integer\\ 1\\ 5)}) =
\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}.\\] In this case, the type `integer` is
parameterized by two integer values. Another example is
\\[V(\\mathtt{(cons\\ integer\\ rational)}) = \\{\\mathtt{(}x\\mathtt{\\
.\\ }y\\mathtt{)} : x\\in V(\\mathtt{integer}) \\land y\\in
V(\\mathtt{rational})\\}.\\]

Compound specifiers can be seen as operators mapping types and values to
types. We might say\
 \\begin{align\*}\
 \\mathtt{integer} &: \\mathbb{Z}\^2 \\to \\mathcal{A}\\\\\
 \\mathtt{cons} &: \\sigma \\times \\tau \\to \\mathcal{B}\
 \\end{align\*}

where $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ are *sets of types*, and
$\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ are particular types. In the remainder, we will
use calligraphic letters ($\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{B}, \\mathcal{X},
\\mathcal{Y}$, and so on) to denote a set of types.

There are some special kinds of compound type specifiers, such as `and`
and `or`. Their definition is relatively straightforward:

\\begin{align\*}\
 V((\\mathtt{and}\\ \\tau\_1\\ldots\\tau\_n)) &= \\bigcap\_{i=1}\^n
V(\\tau\_i)\\\\\
 V((\\mathtt{or}\\ \\tau\_1\\ldots\\tau\_n)) &= \\bigcup\_{i=1}\^n
V(\\tau\_i)\
 \\end{align\*}

Note that if $X = (\\mathtt{or}\\ \\sigma\\ \\tau)$, then $\\sigma
:\\leq X$ and $\\tau :\\leq X$. The specifier `or` will be particularly
useful in the next sections.

The Asterisk $\*$
-----------------

The $\*$ specifier is a little more sophisticated. It can be seen as an
“unspecified parameter”. Suppose we have a compound type $T : X \\to
\\mathcal{Y}$ and suppose $X = \\{x\_1,\\ldots,x\_n\\}$. Then, in Lisp,
\\[T(\*) = \\bigcup\_{x\\in X} T(x) = (\\mathtt{or}\\ T(x\_1)\\ldots
T(x\_n)).\\] So really, it is a convenient shorthand for `or`, but a
shorthand we cannot always write longhand. Consider the specifier
`(simple-vector *)`, which we will simplify notationally to
$\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SV}}(\*)$, where $\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SV}}
: \\mathbb{N}\_0 \\to \\mathcal{V}$. Then
$\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SV}}(\*)$ denotes
\\[\\bigcup\_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}\_0} \\operatorname{\\mathrm{SV}}(n) =
\\bigcup\_{n=0}\^{\\infty} \\operatorname{\\mathrm{SV}}(n) =
(\\mathtt{or}\\ \\operatorname{\\mathrm{SV}}(0)\\
\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SV}}(1)\\
\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SV}}(2)\\ldots).\\]

Arrays
------

Let $\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\tau)$ denote
`(simple-array $\tau$ (*))`, which represents the set of
(one-dimensional, or *rank 1*) arrays of arbitrary length whose elements
may contain any element in $V(\\tau)$.

Pop quiz. Does the following implication hold?\
 \\begin{equation\*}\
 \\sigma :\\leq \\tau \\implies \\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\sigma)
:\\leq \\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\tau)\
 \\end{equation\*}\
 \
\
 \
\
 \
\
 \
\
 \
\
 \
\
 \
\
 \
\
 \
\
 \
\
 The answer is a resounding **no**. This was a little counterintuitive
to me at first. If $V(\\sigma)\\subseteq V(\\tau)$, then surely
$V(\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\sigma)) \\subseteq
V(\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\tau))$, right? It turns out this is
**not** true.

The reason is quite clear when looked through a programmatic lens.
Consider the type $X =
\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\mathtt{bit})$—known as **bit
vectors**—and the type $Y =
\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\mathtt{integer})$. Clearly, both have
representations of the sequences $\\langle\\rangle$, $\\langle
0\\rangle$, $\\langle 1\\rangle$, $\\langle 0, 1\\rangle$, $\\langle 1,
0\\rangle$, $\\langle 1, 1\\rangle$, $\\langle 0, 0, 0\\rangle$,
$\\langle 0, 0, 1\\rangle$, and so on. We can confidently say that there
exists an injection from $X$ to $Y$, and this is true. But similar to
type equality, **an injection does *not* imply a subtype relation!**

Look again at my previous definition of the `simple-array` type:

> Let $\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\tau)$ denote
> `(simple-array $\tau$ (*))`, which represents the set of
> (one-dimensional, or *rank 1*) arrays of arbitrary length whose
> elements ***may contain*** any element in $V(\\tau)$.

This time, I have emphasized the important bit. If we have a bit vector
$b\\in V(X)$ of length 5, then we could not theoretically replace each
of the 5 elements with an arbitrary integer, and still have it remain in
$V(X)$. Because of this, for a function that takes elements of $V(Y)$
*cannot* take elements of $V(X)$ and be type safe. This is also way, for
example, the vector `#(1 0 1 0)` in Lisp cannot be specialized by the
compiler to `#*1010`, because that would be changing the type. Even
though the injection can be inverted at that point, the inverse is only
partial.

Characters
----------

A **character** in Lisp is a union of disjoint types `base-char` and
`extended-char`. Let’s call this set $\\mathtt{Char} = (\\mathtt{or}\\
\\mathtt{Char}\_1\\ \\mathtt{Char}\_2)$ for convenience.

Strings
-------

The `simple-string` type represents the collection of all
`simple-array`s whose elements are a subtype of `character`. This means
that\
 \\begin{equation\*}\
 \\text{simple-string} = (\\mathtt{or}\\
\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\mathtt{Char})\\
\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\mathtt{Char}\_1)\\
\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\mathtt{Char}\_2)\\
\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\bot)),\
 \\end{equation\*}

where $\\bot$ is Lisp’s **bottom type** or **nil type**, represented by
`nil`.

(As an interesting side note, $V(\\bot) = \\{\\}$, and therefore
$\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\bot)$ represents arrays whose elements
are values of that set—of which there are none! So
$V(\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\bot)) = \\{\\}$ as well. But it is
still required by the standard that implementations support that type
with non-existent, senseless “values”.)

Note that this is *not* the same as
$\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\mathtt{Char})$, which represents
*possibly heterogeneous* strings of character subtypes.

This is analogous to the types $P=\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\*)$ and
$Q=\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\top)$, where $\\top$ is the *top
type*, represented as `t`, denoting the union of all types.\
 \\begin{align\*}\
 V(P) &= \\bigcup\_{\\tau :\\leq \\top}
V(\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}(\\tau))\\\\\
 V(Q) &= V(\\operatorname{\\mathrm{SA}}((\\mathtt{or}\\
\\tau\_1\\ldots)))\\qquad \\text{where }V(\\top) =
\\bigcup\_{i=1}\^{\\infty}\\tau\_i\
 \\end{align\*}

Functions That Take a Certain Type, *Only* Take That Type
---------------------------------------------------------

There are many functions in the Common Lisp standard that operate on a
specific type only: `bit`, `char`, `schar`, …, `svref`. It might appear
that since `svref` works on all simple vectors, it must work on anything
which has an injection to simple vector. For another time, this is
**not** true. In other words, **do not** use `svref` on that which is
not `(simple-array t (*))`, which includes bit vectors, even though a
`bit` is a subtype of `t`.

If you’re not sure, see if there’s a generic function, such as `elt`
which works on arbitrary sequences, or `aref` which works on
`(array * *)`, which *is* a supertype of all array types.

Conclusion
----------

As we have seen, Common Lisp types are based on storage and operations
that can be specified—a nominal approach to typing—as opposed to a more
mathematical approach where subsumption and equivalence are based off of
injections and bijections.

This should affect your programs and libraries based off of how much you
wish to specialize. I have produced a new library called
[BIG-STRING](https://bitbucket.org/tarballs_are_good/big-string) which
operates on `simple-string`s, but turns out to be a ton faster if I
restrict to `(simple-array character (*))`. At first, I thought these
types were equivalent, but indeed, `simple-array` includes more
specialized types, and is in fact more general. As a library engineer,
these kinds of types will affect the way you write and optimize your
libraries, and it will affect the way your users consume your libraries.
Indeed, now I must decide whether I want to sacrifice speed for
convenience.
