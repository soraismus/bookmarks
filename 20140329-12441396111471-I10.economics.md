Economist Chris House wonders [why so many physicists are drawn to
economics](http://orderstatistic.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/why-are-physicists-drawn-to-economics/).
It's a fair question, and it must seem strange -- perhaps irritating --
to see people from a foreign field intruding into your territory, fully
convinced that they'll be able to help out even without formal economics
training. They haven’t learned what you’ve worked hard to learn, and yet
they still have such annoying confidence. The explanation, Chris
suggests, is that physicists often believe they're mathematically
superior to economists, and so might be able to sort out some big
problems quite easily.

As he puts it,

I don’t think this is quite right, and I’ll try below to say why. If
Chris has had this experience, that’s unfortunate, but I don’t think
it’s typical of why some physicists choose to work on problems in
economics or finance. Most of the ones I know don’t believe they’re
smarter than economists, or better mathematicians, nor do they think
economics is somehow “easy.” They tend to believe, in fact, that
economics is harder than physics. Physicists don’t think they’re going
to come in and easily work everything out.

What the physicists DO believe, however, is that markets and economies
are great examples of what scientists have come to call “complex
systems” — systems of many elements (people, firms, etc.) with strong
interactions between those elements which create webs of non-linear
feedback. The elements learn and adapt, their interactions create
“emergent” coherent structures and fluctuations at the collective level,
and these structures then act back downwards to influence the behavior
of the elements. What happens in the system comes about through this
interplay of bottom-up and top-down cause and effect. In this sense,
economic systems share a deep character with many physical or biological
systems from the earth’s crust to turbulent fluids to ecosystems. It’s
this complex systems aspect of economics which makes physicists believe
that ideas from physics (and other natural sciences) can be useful in
economics.

This is precisely why many physicists, myself included, are convinced
that modern economics is indeed, in an important sense, “held back
because of a deficiency of mathematical tools and techniques”, to use
Chris’s words. I can’t do better than to quote a short section from
Brian Arthur’s excellent article [Complexity
Economics](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/Papers/Comp.Econ.SFI.pdf),
which describes what many people (including physicists) believe is
lacking from current economics:

> The economy is a vast and complicated set of arrangements and actions
> wherein agents—consumers, firms, banks, investors, government
> agencies—buy and sell, speculate, trade, oversee, bring products into
> being, offer services, invest in companies, strategize, explore,
> forecast, compete, learn, innovate, and adapt. In modern parlance we
> would say it is a massively parallel system of concurrent behavior.
> And from all this concurrent behavior markets form, prices form,
> trading arrangements form, institutions and industries form. … One of

> that these aggregate patterns form from individual behavior, and
> individual behavior in turn responds to these aggregate patterns:

In my experience, it is precisely questions like this that draw
physicists into economics and finance. Their motivation is to try to go
beyond the equilibrium perspective which they see as lacking “the
ambiguous, the messy, the real” as well as “authenticity, aliveness, and
creation.” Most of the work I have written about is in this area, and it
might be worth citing just a few examples (see [this
article](https://medium.com/the-physics-of-finance/dae83e0d7d8a) for a
few more; below I’ve mentioned three from the examples listed there).

To begin with, work by physicists has been significant is establishing
empirical facts about the statistics of financial market fluctuations;
for example, that the probability of large market movements (up or down)
decreases in accordance with an inverse cubic power law in many diverse
markets (stocks, bonds, currencies, derivatives, and in many nations).
This is a very simple mathematical pattern and captures in precise form
the so-called “fat tails” of market fluctuations – the natural
occurrence of large market upheavals much more frequently than would be
expected by ordinary Bell Curve statistics. These “fat tails” seem to be
a more or less universal result. (For some further detail, look
[here](http://physicsoffinance.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/power-laws-in-finance.html);
or [this nice
review](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~xgabaix/papers/pl-ar.pdf) by New
York University economist Xavier Gabaix, who actually worked with
statistical physicists as a postdoc.) Work by physicists has also
established other generic market patterns such as the self-similar
structure of market volatility. I very nice recent review of these
patterns is [this one](http://www.wilmott.com/pdfs/0503_bouchaud.pdf) by
Lisa Borland and colleagues. It is notable that these patterns arise not
only in markets, but in a wide variety of natural complex systems,
suggesting that seeing markets as driven, out-of-equilibrium complex
systems is indeed quite sensible.

As another example, physicists studying minimal models of markets — such
as the minority game -- have found some surprising qualitative features
that one might expect to observe in all markets. In particular, a key
determinant of market dynamics is the diversity of participants'
strategic behaviour. Markets work fairly smoothly if participants act
using many diverse strategies, but break down if many traders chase few
opportunities and use similar strategies to do so. Strategic crowding of
this kind can cause an abrupt phase transition from smooth behaviour
into a regime prone to sharp, virtually discontinuous price movements.
[One fairly recent study](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.1448) suggested that
high-frequency trading may be pushing modern markets through such a
phase transition, with the breakdown of the continuity of prices
movements (lots of mini-flash crashes) being one major consequence. The
underlying phase transition phenomenon may therefore be quite relevant
to policy. I know of nothing in traditional equilibrium economic
analysis that describes this kind of phase transition.

Finally, I might also mention market efficiency versus stability.
Standard thinking in economics holds that the sharing of risks between
financial institutions -- through derivatives and other instruments --
should both make individual firms safer and the entire banking system
more stable. However, a collaboration of economists and physicists
[recently showed](http://www.nber.org/authors/stefano_battiston) that
too much risk sharing in a network of institutions can decrease
stability. (Some discussion of this work
[here](http://www.blogger.com/physicsoffinance.blogspot.com/2011/10/sharing-risk-can-increase-risk.html).)
An over-connected network makes it too easy for trouble originating in
one place to spread elsewhere. On a similar theme, [an
analysis](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1415971) by
physicists (here conducted in a general equilibrium framework quite
familiar to economists!) indicates that complete markets should also
necessarily be unstable markets. In standard theory, I believe, it is
thought that markets become more efficient -- more able to pool
collective wisdom and price assets accurately -- as they become more
"complete," i.e. equipped with such a broad range of financial
instruments that essentially any trade can be undertaken. The new work
has shown, however, that completeness brings with it inherent market
instability. Is this an old result well-known in economics? If it is —
and seriously, maybe it is — I’d like to know.

OK, this post is already way too long, but one final thing. Physicists,
I think, become even more drawn to economics when we look into economics
and see broad resistance to research pursuing this “complexity”
perspective.\
It seems instead that most of mainstream research tries to get around
system complexity with mathematical tricks, rather than facing up to it.
I’m thinking about ideas like representative agents, or rational
expectations. The assumptions make it possible to build models without
having to deal with the complexity of interactions and the emergent
structures they create; but the resulting models, naturally, look very
pale and questionable as models of anything real. When physicists see
that a small minority of (“heterodox”) economists also find the standard
approach hugely limiting, they feel an urge to help out. And they
believe that some of their ideas can help.

To be more provocative — maybe even arrogant?— I think that physicists
are often dumfounded when they look into economics and see the way
theories get built there. Significantly, it is an experience they DON’T
have when they look into other fields. Neuroscientists try to understand
the brain by studying the interactions among huge number of neurons,
neurotransmitters and so on. They’ve recently turned to very large scale
simulations as perhaps the best way to make progress, and it is easy to
see why. Neuroscientists don't try to force their theories into a form
where we can think of intelligence as emerging from the balanced
interactions between one representative neuron and one representative
neurotransmitter, because this would actually eliminate the nonlinear
feedbacks and systemic network complexity that is the central phenomenon
of study. Same goes in, say, ecology or weather science where modern
scientists are trying to find ways to understand complexity *as it is.*
To a physicist, economics looks truly weird in this regard.

Finally, on agent-based models, I think that Chris is perhaps not aware
of how things in this field are developing. Yes, development is slow, as
almost *no one* (in a comparative sense) is working on these things.
There must be something like 50 or 100 DSGE modellers (just a guess) for
any one person working on agent-based models. Even so, there have been
some encouraging successes such as [this
one](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.102.3.53), the
result of a collaboration between physicists and economists, which
explores some practical questions about what caused the recent housing
bubble and brings a lot of real data to bear.

I’m glad Chris wrote his post. I think it captures what many economists
do believe about physicists; that they think they can come in and solve
everything because economics is easy and they’re so smart:

I couldn’t agree more, and physicists who do think they can jump in and
save the day probably aren’t very smart. Yet I don’t think there are
many physicists who think this. They do expect a hard slog, and a lot
more failure than success. But they think that the most profitable
slogging will happen if we take the complexity of economic systems
seriously, and attempt to understand it with mathematics and models
commensurate to the task. Which means different mathematics and
different models than what are generally used in economics today. At
least, this is how it appears to me!
