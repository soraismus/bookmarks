The perovskite lightbulb moment for solar power
===============================================

Cheap, abundant solar power from Britain's grey skies? Don't mock, this
is one dream that could soon be a reality

The worst part of my job as a materials scientist is going to
conferences. They are often turgid affairs conducted in the ballrooms of
hotels so identical to one another that you can't tell whether you are
in Singapore or Manchester. The same speakers are there, for the most
part droning on about the same thing they droned on about at the last
conference. I should know, I am one of them.

But occasionally, just occasionally, someone says something so radically
new that it causes you sit up and actually listen. Your neighbours are
no longer fiddling with their smartphones; there is the proverbial buzz
in the air.

This was the scene at the [Materials Research Society conference in
Boston](https://www.mrs.org/fall-2013-rump-session/) last December,
where a breakthrough in perovskite solar cells was announced. If
perovskites mean nothing to you read on, as they may have a very big
impact on your future fuel bill.

If we could capture approximately 1% of the sunlight falling on to the
British Isles and turn it into electricity we would meet our current
[energy](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/energy "More from the Guardian on Energy")
demands. The reason no one suggests doing this rather than building
wind, nuclear or conventional power stations is the cost. We currently
use silicon solar cells to turn sunlight into electricity but they are
expensive and require subsidies.

Silicon is a poor conductor of electricity because all of its four outer
electrons are bound up in the chemical bonds holding the crystal
together. However, by adding a tiny amount of phosphorous, which has
five outer electrons, you effectively add a free electron to the crystal
and make it conduct moderately well. Similarly, you can add boron, which
has only three outer electrons, and effectively do the same thing, only
now the conducting charge is called an electron hole.

The magic comes when you put a phosphorous silicon layer next to a boron
silicon layer: the holes and the electrons cancel each other out at the
junction but create an electric field that means that electrons only
like to flow in one direction across the junction. This is called a
diode.

There are many flavours of diodes, each having a different junction
architecture. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit light when electrons
flow across the junction but the opposite effect also works: light
hitting the diode creates an electric current, and this is how a solar
cell works.

Silicon solar cells are as intricately micro-engineered as the silicon
chips in your smartphone or tablet, but instead of being the size of a
postage stamp they are the size of a table. They are made in enormous
billion-dollar clean-room and high-temperature fabrication facilities,
which are expensive precisely because controlling the purity of the
silicon and the doping levels of phosphorous and boron is not trivial.
It is also energy intensive. Although prices have been coming down,
fossil fuels are still so cheap it is very hard for silicon solar cells
to compete.

Materials scientists have been exploring other semiconductor
technologies for a long while, trying to find something cheaper and
better than silicon. Until recently the best bet was [dye-sensitised
solar cells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye-sensitized_solar_cell).
These have been around since the 1980s, but they have not managed to
make a big impact on the energy market because, although they are cheap
because they don't require billion-dollar clean-room facilities, their
efficiency is generally low. This is where the new perovskite solar
cells come in. There are exotic-sounding compounds, such as
methylammonium trihalogen plumbates, that have a quite simple crystal
structure called a perovskite. Like the dye-sensitised solar cells,
these solar cells are easy and cheap to make, but they have another
trick up their sleeve – they don't need a complicated diode architecture
to achieve high efficiencies.

Materials researchers in Oxford, led by Dr Henry Snaith, [have recently
shown](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v501/n7467/full/nature12509.html)
that they can make simple perovskite solar cells with efficiencies
pushing 20%. This is big news, because 20% makes them competitive with
existing commercial silicon solar cells [while being much cheaper to
make in high
volumes](http://pubs.acs.org/page/jpclcd/snaith-video.html). They are
also more suitable for incorporating into roofing materials and glass
panels than silicon and so have the clear potential of being as
fundamental to our city architecture as steel, concrete and asphalt. In
other words, they could well be the materials that will make it possible
to collect the 1% of solar energy we need as a nation, at a cost that
can compete with fossil fuels.

Hearing research results such as this makes you grudgingly admit
conferences are worth going to, and indeed gets you wondering whether we
might look back in 10 years and pinpoint this as the time the solar
energy revolution really ignited. One of my industry colleagues believes
so; after the talk he immediately Skyped his research group, told them
to stop what they were doing and get working on perovskite solar cells.
The race to commercialise them is on.
