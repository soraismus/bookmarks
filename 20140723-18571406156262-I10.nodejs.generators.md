Node.js is the one of the best technologies for building I/O intensive
web applications. JavaScript’s single threaded nature provides many
advantages over the thread based execution model found in other
programming languages for this class of applications. But, these
advantages come at a price. Writing large Node applications can be
difficult due to [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/) and
asynchronous error handling.

There are a number of solutions for overcoming these issues.
[Fibers](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers) and
[Promises](http://promisesaplus.com/) are two of them. Some developers
prefer using these solutions, but it all comes down to personal
preference. The yet to be released ECMAScript version 6 also introduces
generators as a solution to callback hell. This articles gives you a
proper introduction to generators and shows how they can be used to
solve the issues mentioned above.

Prerequisites
-------------

As I mentioned, generators are a new feature in JavaScript. The current
stable release of Node (0.10.x) does not include generators. So, we’ll
need to install the current unstable
[0.11.x](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.11.9/) release in order to use
generators. Once you’ve installed 0.11.x, you can enable generators by
passing the `--harmony-generators` flag to Node, as shown below.

`node --harmony-generators <filename.js>`

Generators 101
--------------

Simply put, generators are a type of function (note the `*` in the
following code sample) which act as an iterator. Generators can contain
any valid JavaScript code. Let’s write our first generator (shown
below).

~~~~ {.brush: .jscript; .title: .; .notranslate title=""}
function* HelloGen() {
  yield 100;
  yield 400;
}

var gen = HelloGen();

console.log(gen.next()); // {value: 100, done: false}
console.log(gen.next()); // {value: 400, done: false}
console.log(gen.next()); // {value: undefined, done: true}
~~~~

`yield` is a special keyword which emits a new item from the generator.
We can use `next()` to get values from a generator. Once we reach the
end of the iterator, the returned object will contain `done: true`. Any
data type can be `yield`ed, including functions, numbers, arrays, and
objects.

Values can also be passed to generators as shown below.

~~~~ {.brush: .jscript; .title: .; .notranslate title=""}
function* HelloGen2() {
  var a = yield 100;
  var b = yield a + 100;

  console.log(b);
}

var gen2 = HelloGen2();

console.log(gen2.next());     // {value: 100, done: false}
console.log(gen2.next(500));  // {value: 600, done: false}
console.log(gen2.next(1000)); // {value: undefined, done: true}
// prints 1000
~~~~

Preventing Callback Hell
------------------------

So, how can generators be used to avoid callback hell? First, you need
to understand a simple technique that we will be using heavily with
generators to write code without callbacks.

### Understanding Thunks

A thunk is a partially evaluated function which accepts a single
callback as the argument. Within generators, we’ll be yielding thunks to
write programs without callbacks. A simple thunk is shown below.

~~~~ {.brush: .jscript; .title: .; .notranslate title=""}
function(callback) {
  fs.readFile('myfile.md', 'utf8', callback);
}
~~~~

Thunks can also be created dynamically as shown below.

~~~~ {.brush: .jscript; .title: .; .notranslate title=""}
function readFile(filename) {
  return function(callback) {
    fs.readFile(filename, 'utf8', callback);
  };
}
~~~~

### Using `co`

[`co`](https://github.com/visionmedia/co) is a nice module which helps
to use thunks and generators together to create Node.js applications
without callbacks. I’ll show you how it works internally later. For now
let’s try `co`, which can be installed using the command
`npm install co`. A simple application which uses `co` and the
`readFile()` thunk from the previous example is shown below.

~~~~ {.brush: .jscript; .title: .; .notranslate title=""}
var co = require('co');

co(function* () {
  var file1 = yield readFile('file1.md');
  var file2 = yield readFile('file2.md');

  console.log(file1);
  console.log(file2);
})();
~~~~

As you can see, we are no longer using callbacks. This gives us a simple
way to write large modular Node apps easily.

#### How `co` Works Internally

You might be wondering how `co` works internally. Here’s how it works
its magic.

-   First, it calls `next(null)` and gets a thunk.
-   Then, it evaluate the thunk and saves the result.
-   Then, it calls `next(savedResult)`.
-   Repeat these steps until `next()` returns `{done: true}`.

If you prefer sample code, here’s a minimal version of `co` written to
show you how it works internally. `co` is more complex than this, since
it does better error handling and supports promises as well.

~~~~ {.brush: .jscript; .title: .; .notranslate title=""}
function co(generator) {
  var gen = generator();

  function nextItem(err, result) {
    var item = gen.next(result);

    if (!item.done) {
      item.value(nextItem);
    }
  }

  nextItem();
}
~~~~

#### Modules That Can Be Used with `co`

`co` can be used with any module that utilizes thunks. Unfortunately,
there are not many modules that currently make use of thunks. You can
see the complete supported list
[here](https://github.com/visionmedia/co/wiki). With simple utilities
like [`thu`](https://github.com/arunoda/node-thu) and
[`thunkify`](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-thunkify), you can wrap
any Node module as thunks for use with `co`.

Conclusion
----------

Generators are fairly new, and generally unavailable. However, the Node
community seems to be showing a lot of interest. One of the best example
is the release of [Koa](http://koajs.com/). It is a generators friendly
clone of Express built by the same team who built Express. I’m sure as
time goes on, there will be increased support for generators from the
community.
