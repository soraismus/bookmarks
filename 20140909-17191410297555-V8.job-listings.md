 Weft - [http://weft.io](http://weft.io) - Cambridge/Boston, MA (office
is in central sq.)

       ===========================
       ====== What we do =========
       ===========================

We're the single source of truth in logistics data -- we track every
boat on the water, every plane in the sky, and every truck on the ground
so that we can know everything that's going on in the logistics world.
We do a lot of analysis and optimization, too.

We’re working in the largest, least sexy, most invisible industry in the
world — 90% of everything has been on a ship at one point in time.

The problem -\> To try to decrease costs, carries have been increasing
the size of container ships. The only problem there is that as container
ships get larger, the variability in the global supply chain goes up
(e.g. a large ship being late causes a headache to more people than a
small one).

How we fix it -\> We track every ship on the water and run a bunch of
analysis on our data sets so that we can help our customers smooth out
the rough edges. (One company we're working with spends 6.5 mil every
month on “late fees” because of these rough edges).

       ===========================
       ===== How we do it ========
       ===========================

Web/data stack -\> clojure + postgres/cassandra/redis/rabbit + ruby on
rails + hadoop/EMR (we’re a SOA shop)

Mobile -\> iOS, android in the near term

Algorithms -\> a dizzying mixture of oldschool and newschool techniques
;-)

       ===========================
       ====== And the rest =======
       ===========================

We've got some very interesting partners and customers (ranging from CPG
companies and telcos to enterprise software providers to regional and
international logistics companies). We also have some top tier investors
(a16z, atlas)!

Looking for help on frontend and data science sides! (also looking for
experimentalists for fun hedge fund stuff)

If this sounds interesting, please shoot me an email at marc@weft.io!

you'd be working primarily on the latter.

The UI is written using angular.js served up by a lightweight node.js
api proxy server. We use jasmin/protractor/selenium for our tests and
only accept green builds via travis to be merged to master. Through our
"eybot" on slackhq, we deploy stable code to production multiple times a
day.

The UX engineering team at Engine Yard consists of 3 UI designers and 4
engineers (including myself). We're spread out across 8 timezones
(Dublin through San Francisco), so experience working in a distributed
team is key.

You'll get:

        * Competitive salary
        * Full medical, dental and vision benefits
        * 25 paid days off per year
        * 401(k)
        * We take care of your phone bill
        * Paid travel to conferences

Must haves:

        * A passion for writing great software to solve real problems for real people
        * Demonstrated experience building complex client-side applications in
          JavaScript, preferably with angular.js
        * Experience working in a distributed team
        * The strong belief that a feature isn't finished until it's tested and, where
          appropriate, documented
        * A fantastic sense of sarcasm
        * Ability to travel occasionally (at least once or twice a year)
        * Somewhere between UTC and UTC-8

Great to have:

        * Thorough understanding of git
        * Experience building REST apis
        * Experience with multiple languages (and an understanding of their tradeoffs)
        * Experience with agile development
        * Previously worked at a startup

If you're interested, shoot me your info at cewing@engineyard.com.

end-to-end solutions on an industry by industry basis. Our first
industry is energy, where we're building solutions that can transform
the world's largest industry. In the energy sector, we've started with
two basic solutions:

       * using detailed geological data to pick the best place to lease and drill for oil & gas; 
       * using detailed data on drilling practices to help operators produce efficiently.

The machine learning and statistical challenges in energy have some
interesting properties:

       * geospatial data
       * mix of deep science and machine learning
       * sample sizes are small and samples are highly correlated
       * we care about explainability and insights

Addressing these challenges requires layers upon layers of statistical
machine learning models We want to fully capture the uncertainties in
our modeling at each layer, not just the point estimates.

Software Engineer:

Help us combine software and machine learning to transform industries.
By leveraging insights we’ve learned from running challenging machine
learning competitions that attracted best-in-class talent, we’re now
building out end-to-end solutions on an industry by industry basis.
We’re currently focused on energy, the world’s largest industry. As a
software developer at Kaggle, you’ll work with our team of developers
and data scientists to build solutions that consumes vast amounts of raw
data to produce insights that help companies make strategic decisions.

Client Relationship Manager:

We’re looking for an experienced, multi-talented Client Relationship
Manager with aptitude and interest in supporting the inbound sales
pipeline for new projects. This role will: (1) onboard potential new
clients through a process of email and phone conversations to understand
those customers’ needs; and (2) support existing and new projects by
providing excellent project coordination and customer service. The CRM
role is a cornerstone member of our team who is responsible for
connecting the client to Kaggle’s crowd community and enabling the best
possible outcomes for each project, start to end.

Product Designer/Developer:

As the product designer at Kaggle, you will work closely with the data
scientists and developers on the Competitions team as well as supporting
the creative needs of the energy solutions business. The competition
platform is Kaggle’s primary presence on the Internet with an active
user base that visits our web page to enter new competitions, interacts
with each other on the forums, and learns data science through hands-on
experience. As our first full-time product designer, you will have the
rare and exciting opportunity to be the lead architect of the Kaggle web
experience, as well as guiding our visual identity in marketing and
other customer facing materials.

 Shortcut (www.shortcutapp.com) London, San Francisco - Ruby / Android /
iOS

Hi I'm Buf, one of the founders at Shortcut. Shortcut is all about
making live event concessions better. $50B goes through concessions
every year. No one knows who spends this money. We want to give this
data to the venue while at the same time make life easier for the
attendee.

Shortcut is founded by early employees of Eventbrite and Uber. We allow
attendees at live events to order food/drink/merchandise from their
phone. They can then have it delivered to them or pick it up via a fast
lane.

We have just completed the Techstars program and raised a seed round
(which is not public until late September).

This is mainly a Rails job, but there would be portions of Android / iOS
once in a while.

Tasks:

      * Lead by example – by writing good code, talking about good code, and then drinking beers with the team to celebrate all the good code everyone wrote
      * Design and development of new product features and enhancements
      * Know what technologies are out there in case you need to use them
      * Periodically teach your co-workers all the great stuff you learned via tech talks, brown bags, blogs or open source

Requirements:

      * You ideally have Ruby on Rails experience with at least working knowledge of Android.
      * You want to work in a startup (a.k.a. a place that works hard and plays hard)
      * You feel comforted when you write a good unit test
      * You must have a Bachelor’s knowledge level of computer science via education or experience
      * You know when to use Postgres/Mysql vs Mongodb/Redis
      * You understand the full stack (servers, RoR, javascript/css/html)

Shoot me an email at buford@shortcutapp.com

 [http://3QAYJ.com](http://3QAYJ.com) looking for 1-2 REMOTE WEB DEV -
Full time

- 1) What’s the best thing about your current job?

- 2) What’s the worst thing about your current job?

- 3) What things could you wish for to make your current work better?

These were the questions I asked my team in an email in June 2014. The
intention was to use their answers to better understand and prepare a
job posting in order to attract similar minded people to our company.

**Their response however surprised me:**

- "The best thing in my current job is free of implementation ways and
time limits..."

- "Flexible work hours (and even days!). Ability to move to another
place any time. Good team."

- "The best thing is freedom in ways to resolve the tasks. When I'm
choosing tools, libraries or approaches I'm free to pick whatever will
be the best for task. And not limited by some company policies as it was
on previous jobs..."

- "The working flow standards... Company trusted politic... Team
voice... The happy team... Strict and smart team lead..."

- "No hierarchy. Almost :) I feel we work not only for one person but
for the company, moving this business forward - that's really
inspiring."

Please review full answers here [http://3QAYJ.com](http://3QAYJ.com)

In my opinion their answers were better than any job posting I could
have done. It inspired me to rethink the whole way we normally post a
job. When looking for skilled likeminded people to join our team we
shouldn’t make a job post; rather we should make a “company pitch”. Most
job posts are dictating who you are and what you should do – a common
sentence in a job post often goes like this: “you got a master degree in
computer science and like to...” or “you will develop solution concepts
by using...”. We don’t believe in such requirements. We don’t think of
you as a work unit in a production line. Rather we seek talents and
personalities whom we would want to invest in a relationship with. We
firmly believe modern companies need to rethink the way in which they
attract similar minded people. We must open our door and introduce our
values; as this is the first step towards creating a bond. After all we
are the team that want you to join us.

With that being said welcome to 3QAYJ.com (www.3QAYJ.com) – our company
pitch project to attract you!

**Our workflow is managed via**

JIRA,CONFLUENCE

and all code submitting is handled through Github, pull request. On a
daily basis we communicate via hipchat and each Monday we have a weekly
meeting via skype to touch base. One of the outcomes from the 3QAYJ is
our team summit. Starting from 2015 we will have a real life team summit
meeting some place around the world financed by the company.

We are currently looking at expanding our development team with 1-2
backend developers.

**Job description**

Here is a list of some of the tools and technologize we currently use:

- Nginx

- git

- Capistrano

- compass (scss)

- coffeescript (a little bit)

We'd appreciate if you have experience with the above or you can study
how to use it.

We appreciate if you have:

- skills in Magento development

- skills in web development in general

- skills or at least wants to get skills in mobile applications
development (Android/iOS)

**Good confirmations of your professionalism could be:**

- your github account with contributions to open source projects

- any certificates (Magento MCD/MCDP, ZCE and so on)

- your stackoverflow account

If applying we would ask you to send us an example of code written by
you and make a short pair programming session with one of our
developers.

**What we offer**

- Long term full employment

- Flexible working hours

- Remote job - Work from your home

- Influence in all aspect of your work – freedom in ways to resolve
tasks

- Respect your opinion/ support your own projects

- Stability and personal relationship

- Fully paid Team summit meeting each year.

**Your Application**

We hope you wish to join our team. Besides to technical ability we value
personality a great deal. For that reason we would love from you to make
a personal introduction in which you:

- Let us know what your passionate about (does not have to be relevant
to programing);

- How, why and when you first started programming;

- Share some of your personal goals in life in general (in case you
know).

Please submit your application with any links and code example to the
following email info@3QAYJ.com and please visit our site
[http://3QAYJ.com](http://3QAYJ.com) to learn more.

Thank you in advance

 Benzinga -- is getting massive amounts of new traffic and we need some
more team members to help us handle all the new visitors either REMOTE
or local full-time in Detroit, MI.

       Positions
          ☆☆☆ Lead Front-end engineer
          ☆☆☆ Senior Django Developer 
          ☆☆   Senior Drupal Developer


       Quick Stats
          ★ Customers include TD Ameritrade, Microsoft, Yahoo
          ★ 20 million+ monthly readers
          ★ 1000s of subscribers to our private Marketfy investor communities
          ★ Accelerated growth rate 

We're a financial media company, a poor man's - lest we say everyday
man's - Bloomberg competitor, and a financial product SaaS all forged
together into a powerful trident that is attacking the high seas of Wall
Street in a relentless pursuit of transparency.

And conquer we shall! We've grown 100% quarter over quarter all last
year and another 100% just in the last month. Our team has surged to 30+
people and the waves of revenue washed together to form a rushing roar
with just one of our products going from nothing to $200k/month in under
a year.

Being a media company we find our way into all kinds of cool stuff. Our
office is furnished with things like a $3000 high-end bed that was sent
to us to review. We got to talk to and get pictures with Warren Buffett
and Lloyd Blankfein (CEO of Goldman Sachs) when they came to Detroit.

But, you interject, finance is one of the toughest startup seas to sail
upon! The old boys club runs an ironclad ship with no visible decks for
boarding. Avast! We've built a battering ram of a business in just a few
short years that has pummeled its way deep into the heart of Wall
Street. Old Ironsides has warmed itself to Benzinga and once a taste the
thirst cannot be quenched.

We've recently became Microsoft's premier finance partner alongside 3
other companies, all worth over a billion dollars and established for
years. As of this Christmas we were installed by default on 500 million
desktops and tablets via Windows 8 Finance. No download necessary.
That's right mateys, we're in the source code.

And if you happen to trade or invest yourself you'll find us inside
almost all of the major brokerages in the US.

So, where do you fit in this rigging, you swashbuckling scalawag? Well,
our team is crazy ambitious, motivated, and experienced with shaking
shit up. If you know your tech, and want on deck this is the place to do
it. Your exact technical background and language of choice doesn't
matter as much as your motivation and your ability to adapt quickly.

We are a young team and we're especially looking for sailors who've got
some salt in their whiskers who can help us scale from millions to
hundreds of millions.

Why be a ninja when you can be a pirate? This ship is forging a new
course, send an email to careers@benzinga.com to board!

 Khan Academy — Mountain View, CA (we also love interns, and remote is a
possibility)

We're a small, non-profit tech startup bringing a free, world-class
education to anyone, anywhere.

Here's a testimonial we received last week:

==================================

I have been using your site for almost three years now. I am a 9th grade
homeschooler who has always done okay in math, but I had some major gaps
and lacked mastery in a lot of concepts, especially with fractions. Ever
since I have started Khan, I have been able to go back and not only fill
in those gaps, but master them. And now, fractions are one of the
concepts I do best!

This site is amazing and continues to get better every month. Thank you
to Sal Khan, the Khan team, all its sponsors, and all its interns for
making this site better and more available to all students from around
the world. Please keep doing what you are doing!

==================================

Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all
walks of life who are thankful for our free, high-quality educational
content. Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal's videos, but we
also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with
organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a
huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are
done every week on our site.

A few things we're currently working on building right now:

– Tons of improvements to our core learning dashboard [1] and predictive
knowledge models [2] so we can better personalize a learner's experience

– Infrastructure improvements to make the site more reliable and faster
for our millions of visitors every month [3]

– Better tools for our content creators to allow them to make thousands
of engaging, interactive exercise problems without knowing how to code
[4]

– A major revision to our iOS app to let students practice skills on the
go (or in a classroom with iPads!)

- Expanding access for the billions of learners around the globe through
various internationalization efforts

You'll be part of a small team working alongside both "celebrity" devs
(like jQuery creator John Resig, and Google's first employee Craig
Silverstein) and many more who you haven't heard of but who are also
really awesome.

We're especially looking for new product designers (of all types) but we
also have many engineering positions open as well as some positions for
a teacher and contract question writers.

Apply at
[https://www.khanacademy.org/careers](https://www.khanacademy.org/careers)
and mention that you're coming from HN. Feel free to reply here if you
have questions about applying or about KA in general. Unfortunately we
can't sponsor visas right now unless you're from Canada, Australia, or
Mexico.

\
 We've had interns come from lots of different programs and stay for
different lengths, though most are in the 3-4 month range. That doesn't
mean it wouldn't work out if it's outside of that range and it doesn't
mean that we're not willing to consider other possibilities, though.

You should definitely feel free to apply and explain your situation!

 PythonAnywhere
([http://www.pythonanywhere.com/](http://www.pythonanywhere.com/)) -
London, UK

Fancy helping to build the Python world's favourite PaaS (probably)?
We're looking for a "junior" programmer with plenty of smarts to come
and join the team, learn the stuff we do, and inject some new ideas...

Job spec

Here's some stuff you'd be doing:

Working in an Extreme Programming (XP) shop, pair programming and TDD
all day, woo[+].

Coding in Python lots and JavaScript a bit, and maybe other stuff too
(OK there's like 5 lines of Lua code somewhere. But you could come along
and try and convert us all to ClojureScript or something...)

Devops! Or what we take it to mean, which is that you deploy to and
administer the servers as well as write code for them. Lots of Linux
command-line goodness in SSH sessions, and automated deployment stuff.

Sexy CV-padding technologies! Like Docker, nginx, websockets, Django,
copy-on-write filesystems, Ansible, GNU/Linux (Ubuntu), virtualbox,
vagrant, continuous integration, AWS, redis, Postgres, and even Windows
XP! (although we're phasing that last one out, to our great chagrin).
Don't worry, you don't have to know any of these before you show up,
you'll get to learn them all on the job...

Learn vim (if you want to) much faster than you would on your own by
being forced to pair program with vim cultists all too happy to explain
the abstruse keyboard shortcuts they're using...

Get involved in the nonprogramming aspects of the business too (we all
do!), like customer support and marketing. Honestly, that can be fun
too.

Work near enough to Silicon Roundabout that you can walk to the Hacker
News meetups, but not so near that you're forced to overhear bad startup
ideas being pitched in every coffee shop

[+] The pair programming thing is an unbelievably good deal for new
developers btw, there's just no faster way of learning than sitting down
next to someone that knows and being able to ask them questions all day,
and they're not allowed to get annoyed.

Person spec

Here's the kind of person we'd like

      * Smart -- academically or otherwise. A degree (CS or other), won't hurt, 
        but it's not required either.
      * An enthusiastic programmer (but not necessarily Python and not necessarily 
        professional)
      * A bit wacky (which doesn't mean you have to be an extrovert, just 
        inclined to left-field ideas)
      * Willing to come and work here in sunny Clerkenwell
      * Willing to get paid less than you would at Google or a bank, in exchange 
        for working in an exciting but relaxed tech-startup environment

Here's some stuff we don't care about:

      * Age
      * Male/Female/Black/White/Number of functioning limbs/Space alien.
      * Gaps in CVs
      * Current country of residence (as long as you're willing to move here promptly! 
        You do need to be able to speak good English, and unfortunately we're 
        too small to sponsor visas, so you need to already have the right to live 
        + work in the UK)
      * Dress codes

Send us an email telling us why you'd like to work here, and a current
CV, to jobs@pythonanywhere.com

 Ruby Developer to Fix America Department of Better Technology
Headquarters: USA [http://www.dobt.co](http://www.dobt.co)

About us

We’re the Department of Better Technology, a Knight Foundation-funded
startup that’s digging into the guts of government and trying to fix it
with technology.

Job Details

We're hiring a web developer to help us revolutionize the world of
government IT. We started this company after being embedded inside
government and seeing first-hand the horrors of the technology that
these folks have to use everyday. We worked on a project called RFP-EZ
that made it super simple to view and bid on government contracts. It
wasn't anything amazing -- just a simple Bootstrap site, but just by
making this process easier to understand for web firms who don't
specialize in government contracting, we were able to save the federal
government an average of 30%.

We've been in business for a just under a year, and have already created
dozens of success stories - governments who are using our software to
save staff time, save money, and provide better experiences for
citizens. We're looking to grow our team and help us scale this success
to governments across the country.

Experience

We're looking to bring on a developer who fits the following:

You are experienced in Ruby and ideally, Rails You have strong knowledge
of SQL/Postgres You have a passion for good user experience and are
excited about frontend development, too You are comfortable working with
a 100% distributed team And last, but perhaps most important, you are as
passionate as we are about our mission to revolutionize government IT

Our Culture

For many people in the technology industry, DOBT is a different kind of
place to work, and a different set of people work here. Usually, they’re
people who value time more than they value money. While from time to
time, circumstances may call for it, you aren’t going to see a lot of 80
hour weeks, and depending on your time zone you might see some people
who clock out at around 6.

You’re probably not going to be in a work environment that has a
foosball table, catered lunches, and its own mass transportation either.
That’s because we’re a fully remote firm. While some people may opt to
work together in the same space, we want people to work from wherever
they feel like it. So if you’ve always wanted to live in Japan, now’s
your chance.

Diversity

DOBT is an equal opportunity employer. We will not discriminate and will
take measures to ensure against discrimination in employment,
recruitment, advertisements for employment, compensation, termination,
upgrading, promotions, and other conditions of employment against any
employee or job applicant on the bases of race, creed, color, national
origin, or sex. We are committed in all areas to providing a work
environment that is free from harassment.

How to apply

Fill out the form on Screendoor:

(yay for dogfooding!) Alternatively, send a note to

 Mozilla Research - Video Codec Engineer - Remote or one of the global
offices

The Internet needs a royalty free video codec appropriate for universal
deployment with no gatekeepers. Creating a better video codec is a
difficult task, and creating one with unencumbered technology is even
harder. We've achieved that goal for audio with Opus, but video is still
dominated by royalty bearing codecs like H.264.

We're looking for a Senior Research Engineer to join us building Daala,
a next-next generation video codec being developed by Mozilla Research
in conjunction with the Xiph.Org Foundation. Daala uses lapped
transforms, overlapped-block motion compensation, frequency-domain
prediction, gain-shape (perceptual) vector quantization, , and
non-binary arithmetic coding to achieve superior performance.

If you like low level code, numeric programming, signal processing,
algorithms, or machine learning, you'd probably enjoy working on Daala.

 Hiring a Lead Data Scientist and a Software Engineer (Python) -
Recursion Pharmaceuticals - Salt Lake City, Utah (Also hiring biologists
with mammalian cell culture experience!)

We’re a five-person biotech startup with an amazing set of advisors, and
we're using high throughput experiments, automated image segmentation
and analysis of human cells, and lots of data analysis to find new
treatments for rare genetic diseases faster than anyone has previously
thought possible. There are more than 5,000 rare genetic diseases, in
total affecting millions of Americans, and our serious goal is to find
treatments for 100 rare diseases in the next 10 years. We’ll need the
best minds out there to help us make that happen.

Our approach is to model rare genetic diseases in human cells, then use
these disease models to find drugs that revert the cells to a healthy
state, and thus are strong candidates for impacting the disease in
patients. In a pretty quick experiment, we image millions of human
cells. Image segmentation and analysis quickly makes thousands of
measurements, resulting in a very deep quantitation of the state of
every single cell. The challenge at hand is running the right
experiments in the right way and analyzing results to make the
discoveries we seek as quickly as possible.

My two co-founders developed the basis of our approach at the University
of Utah, using it to find two very promising candidates for a serious
and fairly common genetic disease. We’re moving those candidates
forward, and at the same time adapting the approach to address the
thousands of other untreated rare genetic diseases as quickly as we can.
I joined them to start this company because this is the best chance I’ve
found for a software/stats person to make such a huge impact on the
lives of millions of people. I also believe that imaging-based
biological experiments are going to be a big part of the wave of
advancement coming to treating and curing diseases in the next two
decades.

- You have several years of experience in python software development,
preferably using ipython and other scientific python tools. You’re also
super-comfortable at the command line and handling the standard a linux
server, and great at solving any kind of computational issue via
stackoverflow. No sysadmins, DBAs or the like will be around to help for
a while.

- You’re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making
millions of patients’ lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.

- You’ll work with biologists and data scientists to develop tools to
manage and automate our experiments and analyses. To manage the
experiments and analyses it will take to treat 100 diseases in 10 years,
we’ll need a pretty amazing set of systems in place eventually, but need
to get there incrementally so that we can make rapid progress
immediately using the resources we have.

--

Lead Data Scientist (Python):

- You have several years of experience in statistics, machine learning,
and software development solving problems and answering questions
efficiently using lots of data, preferably using ipython and lots of
python’s scientific programming tools. We’re not hadoop-scale for now,
but every experiment can generate hundreds of gigs of quantitative
measurements.

- You’re ready to take on any problem and figure out the best solution
you can with available time, having fun in the process.

- Maybe you already know some biology, but if you don’t, you’re excited
to learn what you need to (we’ll help, of course!) in order to really
understand our data and approach.

- You’re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making
millions of patients’ lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.

- You’ll come to understand our experiments and data at a visceral level
and help us guide the direction of our experiments and our company
towards our goals.

- You’ll work with our biologists to guide our design/experiment/analyze
cycle towards getting the most impactful biological information from the
most rapid and cost-effective experimental approaches. This includes
researching, suggesting and testing different statistical and machine
learning approaches, along with changing our experimental setup to
provide more useful information with every round of exeriments. You’ll
set the groundwork for how we’ll design and analyzse thousands of
experiments in the coming years.

FULL-TIME ENGINEERS and a FULL-TIME LEAD ACCOUNT MANAGER

We're on a mission to revolutionize how mobile developers acquire users
for their apps. Our product, Toro, makes it super easy to split test and
optimize mobile marketing campaigns. We’re solving one of the necessary,
but tedious, parts of launching great mobile apps. We believe in
creating delightful experiences that are easy to use, save people time,
and, most importantly, save our customers money by improving campaign
performance.

This isn't our first trip around the block. Our previous startup was
acquired by Zynga and our core technology turned into FarmVille and the
rest of Zynga’s most successful games. It was a wild ride and now we’re
full steam ahead on a new adventure. We're well backed by folks such as
A16Z, Greylock, SVAngel, Data Collective, and more.

We're looking for passionate, energetic, highly talented individuals to
join our team. By becoming a foundational member of our team you will
help shape the direction of our product, company and culture. We’re
believe in constantly challenging ourselves to learn new things and

      maturity.  You're as opinionated and influential about product as you are about coding.  
      You're a master at JS/CSS/HTML and customer facing technologies. 
      Bonus points if you’re on-top of your front-end frameworks like Angular 
      (which we use!), Ember, or Meteor.

      - Senior Systems Engineer: You've architected and scaled backend systems to 
      millions of users.  You've put out every kind of fire and learned a lot in the 
      process. You understand the tradeoffs of different data stores, server 
      architectures, and low-level services. 

OUR STACK:

      - Redshift, Redis, MySQL, Rails for our backend API.
      - AWS-suite: EC2, S3, RedShift, EBS, ElasticCache, RDS
      - AngularJS, jQuery, Underscore, Node.JS with D3 for our dashboard and web apps.
      - 3rd party services: Facebook, Mixpanel, Stripe, Mailgun

==================================

LEAD ACCOUNT MANAGER

 REMOTE Senior Ruby Developer Needed!

Hi. We're looking for an awesome Senior Ruby Developer to join our
growing team. If you've ever wanted to work for a interesting security
startup with great people this is your chance. We're a little different
than your average startup so we put together this FAQ.

Q: Ok who are you guys? A: ThreatSim is comprised of some really smart
security hackers who were tired of working for large companies. There
are people here from Mitre, HP, Fortify, RSA, Verizon Business,
Cybertrust, and others. We wanted to do the small company thing and it's
worked well for us.

Q: What would I be working on? A: You'd be working on our SaaS service,
ThreatSim. It lets our customers send simulated phishing campaigns
against themselves. When the user clicks on the simulated phishing link
they are immediately shown training. It's an unconventional approach to
changing user behavior and it works (hint: we have data).

Essentially we get to think like bad guys and help our customers improve
their security. It's an interesting space to say the least. If you ever
wanted to learn more about security and cutting-edge attacks, this is
the place. We simulate evil AND give our customers data that they can
use to protect their organization. You will spend a lot of time thinking
"if I was a bad guy I'd..." then have to pivot and think "if I was a
security engineer I'd...".

Q: Where is this position located? A: This is a remote position that is
open to US residents only located within the US. We understand that not
every developer wants to move to SF, NYC, or DC so we let you work
wherever you are productive.

Q: What technology to you use? A: ThreatSim is built entirely within
Amazon Web Services. Linux, load balancers, auto-scaling, sidekiq,
redis, ansible, git, Splunk, HIDS, two-factor auth, disk encryption, and
a lot of cool security stuff that you probably aren't used to seeing in
a startup.

Q: What skills and qualities are you looking for in a candidate? A:
Here's a bullet list:

Ruby on Rails 3.0+ Relational and non-relational databases: MySQL, Redis
Background job processors (e.g. Sidekiq) Javascript frameworks (e.g.
jQuery, pure JS) Client-side and server side MVC Comfortable with git
for version control Continuous integration MS Office (hah right, could
you imagine?)

If you are interested, send along a resume to jobs@threatsim.com

 Learning Equality - Python/Django/Backbone OSS developer - San Diego
(full-time or intern) or remote (contractor)

\#\# About us

Learning Equality is a recently formed nonprofit that builds and
supports open-source
([https://github.com/learningequality/](https://github.com/learningequality/))
educational software designed to increase learning opportunities for
communities with limited or no access to the Internet. We do this work
because we believe deeply in the transformative power that learning can
have on people's lives, and are passionate about social justice and
breaking down the barriers that prevent many people from reaching their
full potential and living empowered lives.

We started out as a group of students volunteering on the open-source KA
Lite project
([https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/](https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/)),
an offline version of Khan Academy, which we first announced publicly in
December of 2012. An enthusiastic global response led to a flood of
requests for support, features, and partnerships, and we soon realized
we needed to establish a solid foundation to support the project and the
longer-term vision, so we incorporated as a nonprofit in April of 2013.
We have been fortunate enough to raise some funding to support our
continued work, and now have 3 full-time employees, as well as a number
of contractors and interns, alongside a community of volunteers and
open-source contributors. We are leasing space in the Qualcomm Institute
Innovation Space on the UC San Diego campus, and collaborate closely
with researchers and students across the campus.

We're now looking to grow our core team by hiring someone who will help
us to drive our mission and projects forward, playing a strong
collaborative and leadership role in both the development process and in
the organization as a whole. We have a lot we want to accomplish, and
want to continue building a positive, dynamic, and diverse team to help
ensure our vision flourishes.

\#\# Our plans

KA Lite has now been installed thousands of times in over 120 countries
([https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/map/](https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/map/)),
in contexts as varied as low-income schools in India, orphanages in
Cameroon, prisons across the United States, refugee programs in Lebanon,
and First Nations community centers in northern Canada. We plan to
continue developing KA Lite, adding features and improving the user
experience, and supporting deployments around the world.

Next up, we are preparing for the development of a platform, building
upon the KA Lite codebase, that will empower users to create, curate,
share, and learn from diverse forms of openly licensed content, in both
online and offline environments. This will involve building tools for
authoring videos and exercises, an app ecosystem for embedding and
distributing HTML5 educational bundles, features for discovering and
communicating with other devices peer-to-peer over a local network,
interfaces and web-based visualizations for exploring student data, and
systems for motivating, engaging, and guiding learners.

\#\# About you

\* You care deeply about making the world a better place, believe in the
power of learning, strive to promote equality, and resonate with our
statement of core values
([https://learningequality.org/about/values/](https://learningequality.org/about/values/)).

\* You are comfortable in a leadership role, e.g. taking responsibility
for a core component of a project, and mentoring students, interns, and
contractors.

\* You love to build things, and like to think carefully about how best
to serve user needs.

\* You have skills and experience with web development/design, hopefully
using some subset of the following stack: Python, Django, HTML5,
Javascript, Backbone.js, and CSS/LESS (visual design tools also a plus).

\* FLE is still a small startup, and we each wear many hats, and thus
experience in any of the following areas would be valued (though in no
way required): Education (e.g. teaching), Networking (protocols, APIs,
etc), Databases (schemas, efficiency, replication, etc), Hardware
sourcing (finding providers, bulk ordering, build-to-order processes),
Quality Assurance (automated and/or manual testing).

\#\# About the job

\* We're looking to fill a full-time position (possibly starting with a
3-month trial period contract, as negotiated), with a modest salary,
401(k) matching, and health care options. If you feel you might not yet
have enough experience for the full-time position, but are excited about
what we're doing, contact us anyway, as we have an internship program
that could be a way to learn, and get your foot in the door!

\* We offer flexible schedules and vacation time. We emphasize a healthy
work-life balance, accomplishing as much as we can while also taking
care of ourselves and our families, and having fun!

\* Your exact title in the organization would be determined in
collaboration with you, on the basis of the skills you bring to the
table, and the focus of the role you'll be playing on the team. See our
team page for some examples of current and past titles
([https://learningequality.org/about/team/](https://learningequality.org/about/team/)).

\* You'd be working and living in sunny San Diego, at our offices on the
lively UCSD campus. We can help out with relocation costs, and in
certain cases we may be able to look at options for remote contract work
if you're unable to move.

Apply online at
[https://learningequality.org/about/jobs/](https://learningequality.org/about/jobs/),
or reach out to us with any questions at jobs@learningequality.org!

 Heap (YC W13) - Software Engineer - San Francisco or Remote

[https://heapanalytics.com/jobs](https://heapanalytics.com/jobs)

=== What's Heap? ===

Heap is taking a new approach to web and iOS analytics: just capture
everything. Whereas other analytics tools require you to define events
upfront, Heap lets you run instant, retroactive analytics without
writing code.

=== The Role ===

Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your
experience with our stack. We're eager to meet all types of engineers,
regardless of where you live or what tools you use day-to-day.

We’d like to get to know you if:

\* You enjoy teaching yourself whatever is necessary to build something.

\* You plow through obstacles.

\* You’ve written 10,000 lines of code that look really embarrassing in
retrospect.

\* You’ve written 10,000 lines of good code since then.

\* You communicate ideas with clarity and precision.

\* You make decisions with a preference for empiricism and measurement.

\* You like fruit, sunshine, and bad jokes.

Our stack is Node + Redis + Postgres + Backbone + D3. Some things we're
working on:

\* Data capture. We’re integrating with more clients and frameworks,
including Android, AngularJS, and Backbone.js, all with virtually no
performance overhead or integration cost.

\* Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries
that allow our users to slice and dice the data in arbitrary ways. The
results need to come back with sub-second latencies and reflect
up-to-the-minute data.

\* Data visualization. Simple pre-generated graphs just don't cut it.
There's an enormous number of ways to organize the data. Existing tools
only scratch the surface.

Heap was in Y Combinator’s W13 batch. Soon after, we raised a $2M seed
round from Ron Conway, Ram Shriram, Sam Altman, Garry Tan, Alexis
Ohanian, Harj Taggar, and others.

We work in SF but are absolutely open to remote engineers. Email us at
jobs@heapanalytics.com with reasons as to why you'd make a great fit.

 FanJam - [http://fanjam.com](http://fanjam.com) - Haskell Engineer
Remote OR in Chattanooga, TN

Do you love sports & programming? At FanJam, we're building a new kind
of fantasy basketball game on web and mobile. Were a small team with
backgrounds in startups, consulting, and venture capital. Our team
shares a love for either sports or haskell, but we all share a common
love for building the best work place.

In this role, you'd be mostly working on our backend in Haskell,
developing core components, features and infrastructure. We're looking
for people experienced in building large software projects in a
functional programming paradigm. You write clean code using a modular
approach. You care about things like good API design, know what REST is
and how to use its principles (and when not to).

We invest in our people, and team build through whiskey, basketball
games, and hack weeks. We keep the fridge stocked, stay as transparent
as possible, and will buy whatever resources you need to keep learning
(books, screencasts, etc) We're still a small team, so this is a great
opportunity to have a big impact on the product and our culture. We're
looking for people with a passion for their work with high standards.
Ideal candidates have a demonstrated experience hacking stuff; code
samples are best (GitHub, a personal website/blog, previous projects are
all great).

Skills were looking for

• Proven experience in Haskell or other functional programming
languages.

• Familiarity with Javascript is a big plus, since that means you can
handle our client-side too when necessary.

• Being able to get things done and to ship code.

• Experience with large code bases and structuring code in a modular
way.

• Affinity with the web, browsers and new web technologies.

• Familiarity with basic development tools: you know your way around
git, bash, grep and sed. You're not afraid to write a shell script to
automate some stuff.

• Have a good sense of humor and leave your ego at the door

• A desire to get better every day

Interested? Contact me toni (at) fanjam.com

 StoryWorth ([https://www.storyworth.com](https://www.storyworth.com))
FULLTIME, SF, YC-funded

I'm building the core team at StoryWorth and hiring for three roles:

\* Marketing and Partnerships lead. I’m looking for someone who can
think creatively about our customer acquisition strategy then be highly
analytical about executing on it.

\* iOS Engineer. You’ll be responsible for building our mobile app from
scratch, working closely with me on the design and with our web engineer
on the backend. Prior experience building an iOS app is required.

\* Full-stack Web Engineer. You’ll be taking over the core engineering
of the site from me, scaling it as we grow and implementing major new
features. You need to be comfortable with Python, HTML and CSS. Bonus
points if you have an interest in design.

StoryWorth makes it easy for people to privately record their family
stories. Each week, we email our customers a question about their life,
for example “What do you remember about your grandmother?” or “Tell me
about the day you got engaged”. All they have to do is reply with a
story, either by email or by phone. We save their stories and share them
privately with their family.

We have a launched product with paying customers across the country who
love our service. This is an opportunity to be part of the core team
that is going to help every family in the world record their story for
generations to come.

You're a good fit for these roles if you crave a ton of responsibility
on a small team. If you're the kind of person who learns by doing,
you'll be learning faster than ever before. All roles require 3-5 years
of experience.

If you're interested, I'd be happy to tell you more. Email your resume
to nick@storyworth.com, I can't wait to hear from you!

 OpenSignal - London, UK (Full time, permanent)

At OpenSignal we're using mobile apps to tap into the smart phones we're
all carrying around with us to build up global crowdsourced sensor
networks. Our first [1] is for wireless signal where we are building a
global database on the coverage and performance of wireless networks
(both mobile + WiFi) on a scale that has never before been possible. Our
second sensor network is WeatherSignal [2], which uses the barometers,
thermometers and hygrometers on smart phones to crowdsource weather data
and we have already published a scientific paper [3] showing the
potential of this approach. If the concept of crowdsourced sensor
networks appeals to you too then please get in touch. We are hiring for
all manner of different roles right not (backend, frontend, UX/UI & data
science) but most of all we are just looking for smart, like minded
people rather than people with specific, existing skills.

 Smarkets, London, UK. We're hiring Software Engineers. Python, Erlang,
Web-UI and Mobile. Sorry, no remote.

Smarkets is a modern betting exchange with significantly lower
transaction fees than the competition. We're a well-funded company with
a small, agile development team, and our platform has handled over £600
million of bets since launching in 2010. Smarkets has been featured in
publications such as Wired, The Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch and
was recently selected as part of the Startups 100.

We are taking on the big players in the betting industry with the lean
startup playbook. We think the commission charged by such players is too
high, spelling for opportunity to do better.

We're building a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting
exchange based on trading exchange designs. We're also building a fast,
modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our
users is top priority. Whether you want to work on the trading exchange
or the frontend, you'll be solving real and challenging problems - from
scaling to optimising python to handling near real-time design
constraints.

The Smarkets platform is written predominantly on Python and Erlang, and
relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. We use REST where
we can. Life at Smarkets circles around version control, configuration
management and automated testing. We can, and do, deploy to production
several times a day.

Our software stack is built around Linux, Vagrant, Flask, Eventlet,
Postgres, RabbitMQ, Git and Chef - but we are not resistant to change as
needed.

 Gurock, www.gurock.com - remote/world-wide - HQ in Berlin, Germany

About Us

===================================

We are a small & successful bootstrapped software company from Germany
and build popular web-based applications for software teams. We have
been in business since 2004 and many thousands of teams, both small and
large, use our products. We are hiring for different positions, but our
main focus right now is on hiring a technical support engineer to help
us support our TestRail customers as well as account engineers to help
us demo/sell our products.

Those are not typical support and sales roles though, as our products
and customers are very technical (they are software dev/testing teams),
so both positions are quite challenging.

 SalesWise - Atlanta [Midtown] - Fulltime, but interns OK.

Space: Sales is the singularly most important function of any Company.
Many new products and platforms have been created to help sales
organizations with these changes but sales reps and sales managers lack
a compelling, easy to use, interface to organize, visualize, and share
data about their prospects and sales performance.

Solution: We are building a sales platform that automatically interfaces
and integrates with all backend sales systems and tools (CRM, Email,
Calendar, Social, etc). Our initial product radically simplifies how
sales reps organize and interact with the prospect/buyers It’s an
elegantly-designed product adapted to let them efficiently sell to their
prospects without the headaches of CRM entry or spreadsheets.

We’re an Atlanta startup looking for passionate hackers that love
building amazing, technically-difficult products that make huge impact
on people’s lives. We’re a small team with a strong background: a wildly
successful serial entrepreneur that can’t stop and a passionate
ex-Googler that lives on the forefront of tech.

You:

- Love the full stack. It’s OK if you don’t have chops in every
technology that we’re using, but you should genuinely be eager about
learning. Here’s what comprises our stack: AngularJS, Meteor/Node.js,
Javascript, Sass, Go (aka Golang), IPython (data science).

- Look forward to building and owning huge parts of the product. You’ll
be one of the first technical hires and there are a lot of exciting
pieces to work on, lets chat and we can find the right fit for you.

- Love to get going -- have the mentality of a hacker and the quality of
a pro.

- Yearn for the high rewards of an early stage startup. Lucky for you,
not so much risk as we have a great comp plan lined up for you.

- Want to influence and grow the culture of a young company. The way we
see it: We’re building something of immense value, let’s have fun doing
it.

- Live in Atlanta, or can make the move.

- Are full-time, part-time or looking for an internship. If you’re a
rockstar, we don’t care what your deal is, let’s get you on board!

what good code looks like; someone who can spot a bad algorithm, data
structure, or code pattern and quickly teach the developers how to do it
better; and someone who can work with our product owners, business
managers, and third-party customers to define our product roadmap and
the path to each release.

This role is being hired locally for our Pittsburgh office. Compensation
and benefits will match market rates, dependent on experience.

----

Technical Responsibilities:

- Oversee product releases, agile sprints, and day-to-day deployment of
all software development at the company, keeping track of progress of
each member of the team without micromanaging.

more purely managerial role over time as our team expands.

- Translate business requirements and product design plans into
realistically scoped software development tasks, and maintain our team’s
development process to deliver on those plans efficiently.

- Work with developers personally every day, on tasks from abstract
architecture design to line-by-line code reviews, and find teaching
opportunities to build skills.

- Ensure best practices for development are defined, and that team
members are following through on them, from high-level product release
reviews to commenting practices in individual files.

- Collaborate with technical and nontechnical coworkers in other groups,
focusing on product, UX design, quality assurance, R&D, and business
development.

- Keep management appropriately aware of development status at all
times, including seeing potential problems before they happen and
proposing solutions.

- Identify new technologies and platforms to improve our existing
infrastructure, balancing new opportunities with stability and
scheduling requirements.

- Recruit and evaluate new hires as we expand our technical staff over
time.

----

Necessary Requirements:

- 5+ years experience in professional software development.

- Past management experience in a professional context.

- Excellent communication skills, from discussing high-level strategic
plans with 3rd-party executives to training and on-boarding new
developer hires.

- Deep knowledge of Javascript and Python in a web application context.

- Strong opinions about software development practices, including agile
development, code reviews, teamwork, and task management.

- Strong opinions about scalability, code complexity, computational
efficiency, and maintaining uptime in an online software application.

- Great interpersonal and management skills to maintain a positive and
friendly development culture in the office.

- Excitement about building software in educational technology and using
machine learning in applications that support students and teachers in
schools.

----

Preferred Experience:

- Scientific Python using the Numpy/Scipy/Scikit-learn toolchain.

- Javascript application frameworks, especially AngularJS.

- Experience with cloud hosting services, especially Amazon Web
Services.

- Machine learning and natural language processing experience or
interest.

 We're hiring at Prismatic in San Francisco, CA

[http://www.getprismatic.com/jobs](http://www.getprismatic.com/jobs)

== Systems Engineer at Prismatic, San Francisco ==

Prismatic is a great place to be an engineer – we analyze millions of
shared web pages every day, automatically classify them into tens of
thousands of topics, and serve up personalized feeds in real-time using
our homegrown, lightning fast, machine learning-based relevance engine.
We are looking to grow our top-notch team, with both junior and
senior-level positions available.

We are looking for engineers with deep interest and knowledge in at
least one area core to our business (i.e., distributed systems, ops and
tooling, machine learning, designing and building new product features).
We’re a small team, so you will have the opportunity to have a lot of
impact, and to learn from peers who are extremely talented engineers,
computer scientists, and data experts. Our backend is written entirely
in Clojure, a JVM-based LISP that is a dream to work in. Almost none of
us knew it before we joined, and we don’t expect you to either. We are
looking for engineers who will fit well within our engineering culture:
You live and die by good abstractions. You know that they can make the
difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a
spaghetti mess. You think about edge cases and performance implications,
and anticipate future needs. You read and understand existing code
before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever
possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful. You know
when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best
compromise between the two. You recognize that we are all stewards of
the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and
you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are. You are a team
player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other
engineers.

Here’s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as systems
engineer on the Prismatic team:

- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more
comprehensive

- Building out new product features in our API

- Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly

- Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document
analysis, and more

- Creating tools to assist development and ops

- Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and
working with the community to make them better

== Engineering Manager at Prismatic, San Francisco ==

Managers will be responsible for supporting a sizable engineering team,
and applicants can expect to be working on the following problems:

- Writing and reviewing code in Clojure, Objective C and Android. You
should have great technical depth and a passion for great code.

- Helping to manage the development roadmap for large portions of the
product, and working with engineers, tech leads, designers and product
managers to efficiently prioritize and execute.

- Recruiting top candidates for both generalist and specialized
engineering roles

- Evangelizing our technical brand through external communication, press
and speaking at events

- Understanding the growth needs of each person you manage, and helping
them continually expand scope and impact within the team.

== Relevance Engineering at Prismatic, San Francisco ==

Here’s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a
relevance engineer on the Prismatic team:

- Feature engineering for improving the quality of news feeds through
iterative experiments

- Building and optimizing recommendations for topics for users to follow

- Extending and improving the set of topics available to users

- Systems for quickly training, deploying and testing machine learning
models in production

- Creating tools to evaluate the performance of existing machine
learning systems

 TechEmpower - Los Angeles area, California (El Segundo, near LAX)

You may recognize us from the Web Framework Benchmarks that have been
discussed on HN periodically:
[http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/](http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/)

Work Hard, Have Fun, Be Nice

Let's be honest: you became a developer because you like to build
things. Interesting things, useful things, cool things. It's like
building with Legos, only you get paid, and there are always plenty of
the right color pieces.

At TechEmpower, we build things. Interesting things. Cool things, mostly
in webapp form. We build them as individuals, because we're creative
people. We build them as teams, because we like to help each other grow,
and because we know that collaboration improves even the best code.

Having the best people doesn't hurt, either. We've got most of them
already, and we're looking to find the rest. You can build things with
us. What's the catch? We're pretty darn selective.

To work as an individual, you have to be motivated and creative and
thoughtful and serious. To work on a team, you have to be respectful and
energetic and open and absolutely not a jerk. We need developers who can
work on every part of an application, from the data store to the
page–sometimes known as full stack developers. And to be a full stack
developer, you have to know technology and want to learn more
technology, because those acronyms just keep coming.

Our clients expect us to work with them, not for them. We help them
define their problems, and we provide solutions, on time and on target.
We're service-oriented, and you should be too.

Still reading? Please apply! And check out our Web Framework Benchmarks
while you're at it. We pretty much wrote the book on that one.

Just so you know:

       Teams range between 2-6 people
       Developers are exposed to 3-4 projects per year
       All development is done on high-performance workstations with 4K displays. A lot of code fits in 3840x2160 pixels!
       We maintain an informal, comfortable environment, just like the old college computer science lab, but with grown-up hours
       Everybody's nice

The technologies we use vary over time with our mix of projects. Here is
a snapshot of what we're using now:

       Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP
       Tools: Git, Jenkins (Continuous Integration), Sonar (static code analysis), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven
       Web: Dropwizard, .NET MVC 5, Play, Django, Rails, Mustache, Handlebars, Backbone, Angular, Knockout, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.
       Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap
       Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), Rackspace Cloud, Linux deployments
       Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, NoSQL (Redis, MongoDB)

We don't expect new hires to have experience with all of these, but we
do expect you'll learn more about them every day.

If this sounds like the kind of place you'd like to work, please apply
here: [http://jobs.techempower.com/hn2](http://jobs.techempower.com/hn2)

 San Francisco, CA - Remote Core Team Members for the Utter.io Project

For a quick preview of the technology, please visit
[http://stackmonkey.com/launcher](http://stackmonkey.com/launcher) or
watch the video:
[https://vimeo.com/104552201](https://vimeo.com/104552201)

---

Introduction (The Pitch)

Utter.io is like AirBnb or Lyft for excess compute: The utter.io project
provides fast location and provisioning of compute resources within a
cooperative set of systems managed by OpenStack operators. Resource
accounting inside the network is settled with Bitcoin and purchases of
compute instances can be made by users without an account. Additionally,
groups of operators can form adhoc hybrid clouds, allowing fast scaling
and sharing of excess compute resources between trusted entities. If you
are familiar with cloud terminology, this idea may be one possible
solution to some of the challenges in achieving a global cloud
federation.

It is my belief that crypto currency technologies can bring a new
category to the existing cloud offerings of compute, storage, and
network. That new category is trust. While conversations about how
crypto currencies affect our financial systems are definitely
interesting, paying for compute, storage and network with stored trust
is an awe inspiring vision of the future.

More information is available on the public Github repos for the project
(keep in mind the utter.io site is not live yet):
[https://github.com/StackMonkey](https://github.com/StackMonkey)

The fund raise for the Utter.io Open Source project will be done using
decentralized raise methodologies sometime in early 2015 via token
issuance similar to Ethereum, Maidsafe or Storj. A more traditional fund
raise is currently underway for StackMonkey, and will be used to build
the first of many specific knowledge based offerings on top of the
technologies being built with Utter.io.

---

Objectives and Team Overview

This is a pre-raise, core team buildout of roughly 4-5 individuals who
will join me in an Open Source project that spans two distinct
technologies: OpenStack and Bitcoin. Individuals are expected to be
experts in at least one of these fields and moderately versed in the
other.

I am 47, well versed in both technologies, program in Python/JavaScript,
have written all the software to date in the repositories, have started,
run and exited other startups, live in the SF Bay Area, excel at fund
raising, marketing, leading, and enabling individuals to grow in their
careers. I am passionate about this project because I believe
infrastructure is meant to be open, transparent and trustworthy. To me,
there is no greater cause than providing individuals access to
trustworthy commodity grade compute.

---

Desired Skills

Work will need to be conducted around operational crypto contracts,
scheduling of Bitcoin micropayments, integration of blockchain nodes in
the appliances, decentralized SSL tunnel solutions, OpenStack deployment
methodologies, OpenStack SDN and general network architecture,
distributed systems architecture, Python application frameworks,
including AppEngine and Flask, UX/UI/design experience with operational
software, and developer focused evangelism.

If you find this opportunity interesting, consider it worthy of your
passion, and you are looking at a 2-3 month timeframe for a change in
your career, please drop me a line. I'm kordless at stackmonkey dot com.

Thank you for reading and best of luck in all that you do! These are
exciting times.

 NGP VAN - Boston, MA and Washington, DC - Engineering Team Lead,
Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer

NGP VAN
([https://coderwall.com/team/ngp-van](https://coderwall.com/team/ngp-van))
is the world’s leading political technology firm, providing campaign and
organizing technology to Democrats, progressives, and non-partisan
organizations. We offer an integrated platform that combines the best
fundraising, compliance, organizing, and new media products available.

We are a rapidly growing company that built the voter contact and
volunteer management tools used by Obama for America. Nearly every State
Democratic Party in the country distributes our VoteBuilder tools to
Democrats up and down the ticket, and we provide industry-leading
organizing tools for labor unions, environmental groups, pro-choice
advocates, civil rights activists, and international political parties
across the world. Our fundraising and compliance software is used by the
vast majority of Democratic candidates from the Presidential level on
down, and our fast-growing new media platform has recently become the
most-used platform by Democratic campaigns as well.

We have a few spots currently open:

We're looking for an engineering team lead in our Boston office, for our
mostly-.NET fundraising product. This person will work with a 100%
co-located scrum team, but most of the management for the product itself
is out of our DC office. It's a position where you get a fair amount of
autonomy due to that setup, but you also need to be able to keep lines
of communication open across offices. I know that's not for everyone,
but if you've ever experienced the sweet life that is regional manager
of anything, you might realize the advantages to the situation:

[https://github.com/NGPVAN/job-descriptions/blob/master/softw...](https://github.com/NGPVAN/job-descriptions/blob/master/software%20team%20lead%2C%20fundraising.md)

We also have a software engineer position open in our DC office, working
mostly in node with some .NET here and there (and a touch of Ruby or PHP
for some open source projects):

[https://github.com/NGPVAN/job-descriptions/blob/master/softw...](https://github.com/NGPVAN/job-descriptions/blob/master/software%20engineer%2C%20digital.md)

We have a DevOps Engineer position open, which we could hire in either
Boston or DC:

[https://github.com/NGPVAN/job-descriptions/blob/master/devop...](https://github.com/NGPVAN/job-descriptions/blob/master/devops%20engineer.md)

The positions offers competitive compensation and a strong benefits
package. NGP VAN prides itself on being a progressive workplace; we have
a fun and inclusive company culture, including blowing off steam on a
softball field, drinking in the office on Fridays while watching team
demo videos, shooting at each other during Friday Fragfest, enjoying
periodic company retreats to warm places with beaches (including Puerto
Rico this November), and casual Friday every day.

A generalist that loves the details. You believe in writing maintainable
backend and front-end performant code that is well organized. You

and so do you. We don’t have to put in 80hr work weeks, but you know
fixing that last bug matters; adding that key feature means a huge win
for our latest customer; that we’ll try a lot of new things and some
will work, some will not; that we’re building the best team you’ve ever
been a member of.

 Expensify-San Francisco, CA-Fulltime, Programmer Extraordinaire

Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do
"expense reports that don't suck!" (Google "expensify" to read more.)
We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work,
and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee
you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of
distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:

- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton
of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the
sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and
grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports,
without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.

- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we
can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally
interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In
fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you
be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This
isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company
overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard
while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey,
Croatia and the Philippines. We are going to Portugal this month! Want
to come?

- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work
at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being
able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any
given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super
high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our
user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc.
This is not a code monkey job — you're going to be a full participant in
the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to
the table.

- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly
visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always
clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can
switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you're
the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're
this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position
isn't for you.

And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I
can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I
know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to
find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I
get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first
favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I
don't accidentally overlook you?

There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that
is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which
you can find at
[http://we.are.expensify.com/apply](http://we.are.expensify.com/apply)).
We are excited to hear from you! -----

 Industry Dive - Jr. Python/Django Developer - Washington, DC - Full
Time ----------------------------------

We are a rapidly expanding mobile-focused B2B media startup. We have a
staff of writers and editors who cover breaking news, curate interesting
content and write original analysis for executives in industries like
Education, Marketing, Energy, and Retail. See
[http://www.retaildive.com](http://www.retaildive.com) for an example
and [http://www.industrydive.com/](http://www.industrydive.com/) for
more about us.

We use a variety of mostly open-source technology to create our
products, but the core infrastructure is written in Django. You will be
responsible for working with other developers to add features and fix
bugs on our websites, especially adding features to the CMS that writers
& editors rely on. Prior experience with Django/Python is desirable but
not required.

The ideal candidate: + Has 1-2 years of relevant experience OR otherwise
demonstrates an aptitude for software development.

        + Thrives in a fast-paced environment. Is good at multitasking. 
          Has great communication skills.

        + Is self-motivated and entrepreneurial.

CSS/HTML/JS web design experience is a plus. An interest in mobile
(iOS/Android) app development is a plus.

Why working at Industry Dive is great:

        + Short development cycle - When we have a good idea, we like to 
          move quickly and then iterate once it's live.

        + Not the same thing every day - We're still a small company and
          you'll have the opportunity to work on many projects outside
          your core job description.

        + Great team - Work with a diverse team of people who are very
          good at what they do.

        + We work hard, but we also have a lot of fun. And we definitely
          believe in healthy work/life balance. If you're looking for
          lots of crazy all-nighters, this is the wrong place.

        + It's a very exciting time for the company. At 2.5 years old,
          we're exceeding all our targets and reinvesting everything back
          into the company.

If interested, send a resume along with a brief note about why you think
you'd be a good fit to eli-at-industrydive.com. If you have any
question, feel free to ask.

----------------------------------

OTHER OPENINGS: We are seeking a full-time front-end designer, a
design/UX intern, freelance business writers/reporters, and people
interested in media sales. I'm also generally open to mobile app or web
developer internships. Email me to details: eli-at-industrydive.com

 Quantopian
([https://www.quantopian.com/about](https://www.quantopian.com/about)),
Boston, MA

Quantopian is hiring software and operations engineers to help us
disrupt the world of finance. We've built the world's first web-based
algorithmic trading platform, and we're growing our team to support our
rapidly expanding user base and to build everything on our ambitious
product roadmap.

We're well-financed by some of the savviest investors in the business
(Spark Capital, Khosla Ventures, GETCO, and various individuals).

We work on interesting problems, such as:

\* Running arbitrary user code on our own servers, with all the
associated security implications

\* Designing and building intuitive and powerful research and
development tools and APIs for our users Designing data stores to model
real-world financial data and optimizing them for high throughput when
running trading simulations

\* Communicating with broker APIs to trade real money on our users'
behalf

\* Metering and autoscaling our cloud infrastructure to respond to
varying load

\* Designing and building an amazing user experience, both on desktop
and mobile

So far, we've built Quantopian with Python and Ruby on Rails (and a
little Node.js) on AWS and Heroku. We depend heavily on Redis, and our
Docker usage is rapidly growing. However, we are very pragmatic and our
highest priority is shipping user-delighting features built with the
most sensible technologies. Be sure to check out Zipline
([https://github.com/quantopian/zipline](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline)),
our open-source backtester. We have several other projects that we plan
on open-sourcing as well.

We've assembled a top-notch product and engineering team here in Boston,
and we're growing fast. We're open to all levels of experience, from
still-in-college to seasoned veteran. A financial background is not
necessary at all (but is always nice to have).

We're still small enough that you will have a material impact on our
company's trajectory. Our small size and ambitious goals dictate our
approach to talent acquisition and retention: we believe in hiring the
best engineers and giving them hard problems to solve and the autonomy
to solve them.

Ideally, you:

\* have a solid background in computer science fundamentals

\* have good communication skills

\* thrive on designing, building, and shipping mind-blowing features
that delight our users

We provide:

\* All the standard stuff (fully paid health and dental for you and your
family, 5% 401(k) matching, gym and phone reimbursement, pretax transit,
weekly catered lunch).

\* Your choice of computer equipment

\* A beautiful new office (in October) in downtown Boston

\* Fun and intellectually stimulating work environment. We ship early
and often. We have lives outside of work. We like each other.

 Upcoming (www.upcoming.nl) - Amsterdam, The Netherlands (No remote, but
we'll relocate you) - Full Stack Software Engineer

===== About us =====

Upcoming is a Dutch 'listicle' website (a listicle is an article
consisting of a list of funny/informational/sentimental/whatever stuff).
We've been growing continuously since we launched last year, already
reaching 10% of the Dutch population with zero € spent on marketing.
We’re (an independent) part of Telegraaf Media Groep, one of the biggest
publishers of The Netherlands.

===== Abour our tech stack =====

We use python in the backend (Flask, Celery+RabbitMQ), and manage the
frontend with Jinja2, jQuery, LESS and Grunt; persistence is done with
MySQL and Redis. The deployments are automated, in a Continuous
Integration environment.

Our backend is developed in-house, with state-of-the-art publishing
related features such as:

- Monitoring of 1000's of rss feeds from news websites, in order to
detect trending articles all around the globe.

- Advanced analysis of our own articles' metrics, for automatically
promoting them among our publication channels (this is aimed at
maximizing virality).

- (Bayesian) Headline and thumbnail A/B testing

- Highly scalable click-through-rate optimizer, presented in a workshop
of the ACM Recommender Systems conference in Hong Kong last year.

Since we're part of a big media group, some of these tools are now being
used by other teams, reaching tens of millions of users every day.

===== What we're looking for =====

- CS degree and/or relevant web experience

- Ideally, someone who has spent some time across the whole stack, but
we will consider people who consider themselves “just” a frontend or
backend developer.

- Pragmatism

- Python experience not mandatory - just show us that you’d be willing
to learn and that you’re smart :)

===== What we offer =====

- A perfect balance between working on innovation projects and “regular”
web development, both with short and iterative development cycles.

- The flexibility and dynamism of working in a startup, with the strong
stability of being part of a big company.

- An international environment, with people from all over the world (UK,
Italy, Romania, Argentina, Brazil, Iran, and more)

- Thorough relocation assistance, regardless of where you’re coming from

- A competitive salary

- 25 vacation days

- Amsterdam! You’ll be living in one of the most beautiful and
cosmopolitan cities in the world.

If you’re interested, drop me a line: m.neustadt(at)tmg.nl

 Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michigan

[http://www.mutuallyhuman.com/](http://www.mutuallyhuman.com/)

---------------------------------------

We are a small team passionate about making people's lives better
through software. We're hiring for full time positions as software
developers and software designers at our office in Grand Rapids.

A little bit about us:

      - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.

      - We aren't limited to any really specific set of technologies, which is a great
        opportunity to learn. In the past year, I've worked with Objective-C (and Swift),
        Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js, QT Node.js, and of course Ruby.

      - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
        activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
        rare by design.

      - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

      - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit
        sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
        with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

      - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us
        access to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.

A little bit about Grand Rapids:

      - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

      - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
        the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.
        Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43

      - Low cost of living. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
        30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

      - A growing technology and startup community.

A little bit about you:

      - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

      - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
        afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile technologies.

      - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

      - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

I'm a software craftsman on this awesome team. If you're interested, get
in touch with me:

KickBack Rewards Systems is a privately held company founded in 1999
that specializes in customer specific marketing and payments for over
1000 US clients. Our clients include a half-dozen Fortune 50 companies,
one of them is an anchor partner in our national coalition loyalty
program. As the CTO and Director of Software Development I need some
help! You will be joining a medium sized team of 13 developers who all
commit to their projects as a labor of love and their lives work. If you
are interested in any of these positions my contact information is
located under my profile.

-

Back-end engineer

I am looking for that elusive 10x engineer polyglot that can create
scalable back-ends. The right person is on-board with microservices and
has been implementing them since before they were a fad. Message queues,
concurrency and fault tolerance should be second-nature to you. Our
current stack is Python, Celery, and Docker.

-

Front-end engineer

Our front-end tools are all built in AngularJS with a half dozen other
JavaScript libraries like D3. We have some interesting UI/UX challenges
in graphing metrics and representing data that our current front-end
team describe as nothing less than "the most exciting and challenging
work they've had for awhile." You're supported by an incredible UX team
to perform the heavy lifting as far as design and deciding which A/B
testing should occur.

-

Mobile Developer

KickBack uses Xamarin (C\#) to build a native and compiled mobile
application for iOS and Android. We have an amazing contractor building
our app who is acting as the lead, architect and senior engineer. You'll
be working with the best. We're looking to add a little redundancy and
augment the team with additional resources if we can.

-

Security engineer

Last but not least, I am looking for an Information Systems Security
expert. KRS works in a live transaction processing environment and
identifying fraud, patterns and preventing information breaches and
transaction fraud is second nature to the right candidate. I'm looking
for that type-a engineer who cannot sleep if he or she believes an
attack vector exist. He or she has an extreme sense of responsibility
and can execute on delivering best-practice prevention methods. This
role is both advisory ("Team, implement this best practice") and
execution ("Team, I implemented this best practice..") We're lean and
mean so you should have no problem at all hacking on Ruby one day to
deploy a new 'hids' through Chef or drafting a Cisco IOS access-list the
next.

 Switch - [http://switchapp.com](http://switchapp.com) - New York, NY

Looking front-end and full-stack engineers.

We’re building a data-driven platform for job discovery. Our goal is to
fundamentally change the way people find their next job. We're focused
on making it easy for people with jobs to discretely explore new
opportunities and connect directly with employers looking to hire.

Our engineering team is small and passionate about combining data and
design to build the best product. We're looking to grow our engineering
team by adding a front-end engineer and a full-stack engineer. Both
folks will have a opportunity to have a huge impact on a very small team
and will be working closely with our founders and CTO (that's me). Our
team loves wearing many hats, and we’re looking for folks that feel the
same way. In addition to shaping and building iOS and web apps, you will
also have the opportunity to scale our Python API backend, perform
data-analysis on our behavioral data, improve our matching algorithms,
and generate product ideas.

Front-end Engineer:

We’re looking for someone to help us expand Switch beyond iOS, building
web apps that connect with our platform. The ideal candidate is a
Javascript / CSS whiz with a portfolio of great web apps they’ve built.
Web design experience is a huge plus.

Skills:

      * Excellent knowledge of HTML, Javascript, CSS (LESS / Sass), and Git
      * Working knowledge of Python and SQL
      * Experience with MVC Javascript frameworks like AngularJS
      * Experience building apps powered by REST APIs
      * Strong desire to learn and grow as a developer
      * Great sense of design and product
      * iOS / Android experience is huge plus

Full-stack Engineer:

We're looking for a full-stack developer who loves implementing ideas
end-to-end. Our current team will start with a product idea, come up
with a data model, implement a new API endpoint, write unit tests,
optimize query performance, and add new features to our iOS app that
call that endpoint. We're constantly growing as developers each day and
are looking for folks that are eager to leverage their previous
experience, but also want to grow and learn new technologies /
languages. Our ideal candidate has built web apps / mobile apps
implementing both front-end and back-end features. Our current API is
built using Python (Django). We also use Scala for some data science
applications.

Skills:

      * Strong backend skills implementing APIs for web apps
      * Experience building front-end features (web / mobile)
      * Familiarity with some of technologies we use: Python (Django), Obj-C, Scala
      * Strong desire to learn and grow as a developer
      * iOS / Android experience is huge plus

If you're interested, please email jobs@switchapp.com

 Close - San Francisco

Hiring full-time in SF (SoMA), contract-to-hire preferred: \* Generalist
or Rails Engineer (application stack) \* Back-end Python Engineer (data
stack) \* Data Scientist \* UX/UI Designer

We're a seed funded startup with several former Googlers, and we're
tackling the messy world of business. Every day, people shake hands over
million-dollar deals that can change the future of a company. From
fundraising and acquisitions to partnerships, promotions and product
placement, businesses get together and make new things happen. But
there's no platform for them; they typically overload sales-focused
CRMs, or are stuck in the world of spreadsheets and email. We're
changing that.

It's a fascinating data problem as we're mapping out professional and
company-to-company networks, trying to understand who does business with
whom and why, feeling our way around the underlying graph that nobody's
explicitly mapped out before. From old school tie to the boardroom, why
do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence
networks? What's the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it
mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my
startup funded?

We're trying to answer all these questions. We have an invite-only
product already launched, we're building a team-facing solution, and
we're expanding our data team to work on the platform that powers it
all. Here's my take on the space:
[https://medium.com/@jennielees/the-joy-of-data-a1d3757d3567](https://medium.com/@jennielees/the-joy-of-data-a1d3757d3567)

Looking for fast learners who can get their hands dirty, quickly; who
know when to duct tape and when to have 100% test coverage (think like a
hacker, ship like a pro); who don't mind being wrong occasionally; and
who are intrigued by the overall space we're in. We've had a good run
from HN posts so far, hoping to continue it.

You'd be potentially a single-digit employee and have a significant
chance to influence our culture and growth, as well as immense impact on
the product itself. We have a generous equity setup, though we prefer
contract-to-hire so we can figure out if we'd work well together.

For our generalist role we'd prefer it if you have Rails and JavaScript
experience; for our data roles, Python. Graph-specific data experience
is a bonus.

I lead engineering at Close, and I'm also happy to chat for coffee if
you're interested in startups, this problem space, or if you're
interested in the product itself.

Email jennie+HN@close.co.

 The Climate Corporation (San Francisco, Seattle, INTERN/H1B) -
[http://climate.com/careers](http://climate.com/careers) The Climate
Corporation's mission is to help all the world's people and businesses
manage and adapt to climate change. We use a combination of weather
monitoring, agronomic modeling, and weather simulation to provide data,
insights, and decision making tools to farmers in the United States.

Climate's technical staff numbers around 80-100, and we're hiring
full-time employees and interns across many teams as we expand efforts
on a new class of decision support tools for growers. Work is split
across groups focusing on web applications for farmers and agents, risk
and insurance policy management, internal platform and data services,
and scientific modeling and research, with roles for:

\1. Software engineering generalists with solid CS fundamentals,
particularly anyone interested in building (i) entirely new, large-scale
distributed data services for scientific computing (we use Clojure); and
(ii) web applications (Rails, Python, Javascript, and iOS) used by
farmers to manage weather risk.

\2. Quantitative researchers in statistics/ML, stochastic optimization,
remote sensing, atmospheric physics, and agronomics. Our goal is to
forecast statistical distributions of crop yield for any piece of arable
land, synthesizing satellite images, digital elevation models, weather
data, agricultural statistics, and geological surveys into multiscale
models that underly our data services.

\3. Experienced technical team leads, operations engineers, product
managers, and designers to pull all this together into a compelling
product.

The scale and interdisciplinary nature of the work drive a lot of
cross-collaboration within the company, supported by a pressing need to
build durable solutions to some very hard and important problems.

Competitive salary, excellent benefits, stock options, etc. Our 25% time
is lumped into two-week sabbaticals. The usual details about these
positions are here:

 CypherChat - Software Engineer - REMOTE

       =====================================
       ================ Us =================
       =====================================

We're building a completely frictionless encrypted messaging service.

Our goal is to bring privacy and security to the unsophisticated masses,
by targeting users who value those qualities in principle but won't
compromise "for-your-grandmother" ease of use. Eventually, we'll be
replacing conventional telephony/SMS.

Team:

        * Ryan Lester (Washington, DC): Carnegie Mellon, SpaceX, Napster.fm, YC Hacks
        * Josh Boehm (Los Angeles): SpaceX, Napster.fm, Baron of the Principality of Sealand

Status:

        * Funded
        * Pre-launch, but with a working (very alpha) version of the product
        * We have a nice office in the DC area, which you'd have the option to work out of

       =====================================
       ================ You ================
       =====================================

You would be our first hire, so you'd get to help establish the company
culture and probably end up managing a dev team. Right now, you'd be
working directly with the founders.

If you have strong (mobile) UI/UX skills, you'll be a great fit.

Ideally, you'd be willing to start before the end of September (the
earlier the better).

We don't care much whether you've already used any of these, but you
need to be willing to work with the following technologies:

        * JavaScript (okay, you should have at least used this one)
        * Titanium (compiles JS/XML to cross-platform native apps; it's hella dope)
        * Crossrider (cross-browser extension framework)
        * OTR
        * XMPP
        * WebRTC

       =====================================
       =========== Compensation ============
       =====================================

We'll pay well. We can negotiate the amount and the equity/cash ratio
based on your preferences and qualifications/experience.

If necessary, we may be willing to provide hardware.

Also, any interest in being paid in Bitcoin? (I haven't looked into the
recent IRS guidelines on this, so it may be a horrible idea. If you live
outside the US, though, this could possibly turn out to be really
convenient. I'll talk to our lawyer about it.)

       =====================================
       ======= If you're interested ========
       =====================================

Email me a resume or something at hacker@linux.com.

 San Francisco, CA Mixpanel (YCS09;
[http://mixpanel.com](http://mixpanel.com)) is the most advanced
advanced analytics platform ever for web & mobile applications.

Mixpanel is profitable, with thousands of customers and millions in
monthly revenue.

ENGINEERING CULTURE

Our engineering culture:

      * We do very thorough, line-by-line code reviews using GitHub pull requests. This keeps our code quality high and helps us learn.
      * We try to have two people work together on every project (collaborating, not pairing). It's more fun and it results in better code.
      * We practice rapid iteration. If it's better than live, we ship. We also build things so they can go live (whitelisted) long before launch day.
      * We write tests for things that are mission-critical, prone to failure, or cause paranoia. Think billing and datastore code, not Django views.
      * We care about learning. Right now we're reading through Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment.
      * We currently have 9 vim users, 2 IntelliJ, and 1 emacs holdout.

ENGINEERING POSITIONS

We have two types of engineering positions available - systems and
product. Both of these positions require you to be able to work in San
Francisco, CA.

Systems engineers build and scale our infrastructure, and write mostly
C, C++, and Python. We are working on a number of new products right now
with serious infrastructure challenges and we need more people with
great depth to help us solve them. This position requires at least 5
years of experience.

Responsibilities of this role include:

      * Working on our custom datastore (written from the ground up in C)
      * Scaling the data processing pipeline (currently handling > 50K requests per second)
      * Building notification delivery infrastructure (currently sending > 100M emails & push notifications per month)
      * General improvements to performance, reliability, and security
      * Work with the rest of the engineering team to design, build, deploy, and maintain systems

interesting stuff to do. Happy to talk details.

 ListRunner (YC S2014), San Francisco And/Or Montreal - FULL-TIME (Can
help with VISA)

ListRunner (www.listrunnerapp.com) brings project management to doctors
in hospitals. It's hard to believe but doctors are still using paper and
pager to manage their team and critical patient information. They're not
even allowed to use email..

We're getting amazing traction - and excitement from doctors - and we
are looking to expand the team with a few key people:

\1) Backend developer: We use Mongo and Node. Lots of very cool
challenge in building a robust and flexible API. Experience with
real-time synchronization, AWS, security, offline apps and Angular.js is
definitely a plus.

\2) Product/UX designer: Building an app for doctors is a big UX
challenge. They're extremely busy people and are used to have access to
lots of information all the time.

\3) UI Designer: Doctors are tired of those ugly 1980 computer systems
still in use in hospitals. They want to work with the same kind of
polished and beautiful apps that they've started using at home. We're
looking to push the current healthcare design status quo to a new level.

\4) ios and Android developers: We're looking for great ios/android
developers with an eye for design who can take a leading role in
implementing beautiful and snappy native apps.

\5) Machine Learning / Data geek: Right now, 75% of critical patient
information is trashed at the end of the day. That information is not
going back in the EMR and is totally wasted. There are so many
opportunities in helping finding better diagnosis, helping doctors be
more efficient, helping the departments/hospitals save time and money,
etc.

\6) Front-end developer: We're looking for a great front-end
developer/designer who love writing clean html/css code with an
attention to details (We care about those pixels). Experience with
Angular.js with an eye for design is definitely a plus.

----

We're a multi-disciplinary team (Two doctors on the team) solving a
massive healthcare challenge. Doctors love ListRunner and they can't
wait to start using it every day. If you're looking for an opportunity
to use your technical and design skill to solve a real, practical and
meaningful problem, please reach out to us (contact@listrunnerapp.com or
to me directly at phzbox@gmail).

Remote OR in Chattanooga, TN

Do you love sports & javascript? At FanJam (fanjam.com), we're building
a new kind of fantasy basketball game on web and mobile. We're a small
team with backgrounds in startups, consulting, and venture capital. Our
team shares a love for either sports or programming, but we all share a
common love for building a winning culture.

In this role, you will be working with mostly client-side javascript.
We're still in the early stages of development, so we’re looking for
someone comfortable in architecting front end code using a modular
approach & capable of making good design decisions. An ideal candidate
is keeping up to date with the rapidly changing javascript landscape and
has experience working with realtime applications. You’re aware of the
challenges of DOM implementations between browsers and can write clean
code to deal with them.

We invest in our people, and team build through whiskey, basketball
games, and hack weeks. We keep the fridge stocked, stay as transparent
as possible, and will buy whatever resources you need to keep learning
(books, screencasts, etc) We're still a small team, so this is a great
opportunity to have a big impact on the product and our culture. We're
looking for people with a passion for their work with high standards.
Ideal candidates have a demonstrated experience hacking stuff; code
samples are best (GitHub, a personal website/blog, previous projects are
all great).

You can work remotely or at our offices in Chattanooga, TN

Skills we're looking for

\* Proven experience working with Javascript on client-side (ember.js/or
angular/react)

\* Experience working with web sockets & realtime technology

\* Comfort on the front end html5, compass, and css/sass

\* Being able to get things done and to ship code.

\* Experience with large code bases and structuring code in a modular
way.

\* Affinity with the web, browsers and new web technologies.

\* Familiarity with basic development tools: you know your way around
git, bash, grep and sed. You're not afraid to write a shell script to
automate some stuff.

\* Experience with data visualizations is a big plus

\* Have a good sense of humor and leave your ego at the door

\* A desire to get better every day

 VERBA - San Francisco, CA

[http://verbasoftware.com/](http://verbasoftware.com/)

jobs@verbasoftware.com

\* Rails/JS Product Focus - FULL-TIME or HALF-TIME with benefits [work
on your side projects!]

Verba thinks that college should be more affordable, so we help
bookstores get books faster, cheaper, and sell them competitively.

We guide every stage of a used book's life. We help students save money,
and bookstores become and stay relevant, competitive, and transparent.

Numbers: 400 colleges and universities (and more beating down our door),
tracking \~200k unique ISBNs, serving millions of students (rush season
means 100 requests/s), raising the "win rate" for bookstores to 80%, and
dropping prices across the board. 19 employees, 3 part-time. 2 dogs. 5
cats. 3 children.

Code: Ruby, Rails, JS, Clojure for Hadoop, MySQL on AWS w/ Chef. We love
experiments and go with what works! We also love making a stable, solid
product which is why we have a ton of tests, metrics and a one-click
build pipeline.

What's in it for you: A great team and company culture, benefits (even
for part time!), laptop, books, BART pass, pool table, somewhat healthy
office snacks, great conversation during our yearly company work-cations
([http://verbasoftware.com/vacay](http://verbasoftware.com/vacay)), and
hard, challenging, fulfilling work.

Message us if: You want to help make education better. You've got strong
Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture,
and know enough JS to help out on front-end. We prefer slope over
y-intercept.

How to get the job: Write a cover letter to jobs@verbasoftware.com that
speaks to why this job might fit with you, and how you could help us
out. The first step is a phone screen to solve a small programming
problem. Then we'll schedule an on-site interview for a few hours, and
have you walk through some of our code with us. Also we'll ask you some
historical behavior questions, not logic puzzles. Then we'll make you an
offer, and you'll accept and we have a new employee party!

 PSYCHOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES ([http://PSYT.co.uk](http://PSYT.co.uk)) —
London, UK

\* We're looking for an experienced Android and/or full stack engineer

WHAT WE DO. We’re a tech startup creating corporate and consumer
products to measure and enhance wellbeing and productivity. There are
two strands to what we do. First, we quantify cognitive and
psychological states, such as attention or happiness. Second, we deliver
interventions, such as mindfulness, to boost cognitive and psychological
skills. Web and mobile apps are key to both these strands.

WHO WE ARE. Our backgrounds span finance, psychology, technology, and
design. CTO George leads on the measurement side, having mapped the
nation’s wellbeing with the Mappiness app
([http://mappiness.org.uk](http://mappiness.org.uk)). CEO Nick leads on
interventions, as the former Head of Research for successful mindfulness
app Headspace
([http://www.getsomeheadspace.com](http://www.getsomeheadspace.com)).

WHAT WE USE. We love CoffeeScript, both in the browser and for our
internal app logic. Our back-end is largely Postgres and Ruby. We could
imagine using Node, Python, Go and/or R at some point; maybe other
things too. Our iOS apps are Objective-C, of course, with liberal use of
SpriteKit and Accelerate (we’ve tried RubyMotion — impressive, but
probably not for us — and we’re playing with Swift). Our Android apps
don’t exist yet, and that might be where you come in.

WHO YOU MIGHT BE. We’re looking for someone smart, opinionated, and
enthusiastic (in the face of interesting work). Someone with solid
experience in web, Android (especially) and/or iOS app development, who
likes learning, and who agrees that UX is the most important — and
usually the hardest — thing to get right. Bonus points for any of: user
testing, sysadmin or database expertise; an interesting technical blog
or Github/BitBucket profile; and an interest in mindfulness or
subjective wellbeing.

WHERE WE’RE AT. We've just completed our first investment round.
Currently our CTO does all development, so you’d be our first developer
hire. That means we can be flexible about the work you take on, playing
to your strengths and your preferences. That also means you can expect
to help guide our development and share in our success.

Full-time software engineers

Firefly is a tool for schools to make it simple for students, teachers
and parents to create, share and learn. We're small (\~30 people, of
which 6 are full-time developers), which means we can stay close to our
clients and develop and improve our products very quickly to meet their
needs. It also means you'll get great exposure to all of the things that
go on in a fast growing business, and have a chance to have a big impact
very quickly.

We’re looking for a generalist and web developers to join our growing
development team. Development deals with expanding the functionality of
Firefly, as well as providing support for the existing areas of the
product. Previous experience in real world web development; familiarity
with databases, mobile development and other school systems are helpful
but not necessary.

We're looking for someone who is:

        • A keen and efficient problem solver
        • Independent in their work
        • Able to locate and fix problems in existing code
        • A good team player to work with other members of the team and work alongside
           our support team when necessary
        • Good with time management
        • Happy to take on responsibilities
        • A logical thinker
        • A good communicator – within the team and with other areas of the business

Knowledge of any of these would also help:

        • Microsoft development technologies (especially C# and ASP.NET)
        • Mobile app development (iOS or Android)
        • Linux, PHP and scripting
        • Experience in the education sector

Most importantly, we're looking for someone friendly, enthusiastic and
good at picking up new skills quickly. Salary would be competitive and
depend on experience. All of the Firefly team also participate in a
yearly bonus scheme based on the success of the business and their
contribution. We're committed to your own professional development, so
we offer a flexible training budget for you to spend on attending
courses or other events.

performance needs. If you're up for the challenge of making a website
feel like a desktop app and have deep experience with the following then
email your CV to jobs@irccloud.com

      * Backbone/Underscore/React
      * jQuery
      * CSS/SASS
      * WebSockets
      * gulp/browserify
      * JS step debugging

DESIGN

IRC has a reputation as a chat tool for hackers, and a long history to
go with it, but it's not always been associated with brilliant design.
We've set out to fix that by giving IRC a beautiful and intuitive home
on the web and mobile devices.

Our focus is on functional elegance, clarity, and making complex things
obvious. And it's time to step it up a notch. We're looking for someone
to help us make IRC more appealing to those who've never used it to
collaborate before, while still making sure the old hands feel at home.

We need to respect the IRC community, and the limitations of the medium,
while making bold decisions that question the conventions of the last 25
years. We're not building something completely new, trendy, and
unproven. IRC is still thriving for a reason, and you'll be responsible
for better aligning it with the way people communicate online today.

Ideally, you'll have several years of experience designing for the web
and mobile, with a strong graphic design background. A working knowledge
of HTML/CSS for in-browser prototyping would be a significant bonus.

You like to code. You code for work or school and you code in your spare
time.

language or framework

You work smarter AND harder and you have a passion for learning and

 Scribd (YC '06), San Francisco - VISA, FULL-TIME, and INTERN are all
welcome

Scribd ("Netflix for eBooks", top 100 website, 50 people) is hiring
talented hackers of all kinds to help us build the library of the 21st
century.

We've hired EIGHT full-time people and TONS of interns from these "Who
is Hiring" threads ... it really works!

We're looking for people who want to work with:

\* Ruby on Rails (we're the \#2 largest rails site, after Twitter)

\* Javascript (well, we use Coffeescript)

\* iOS OR Android (we're a top 10 eBook app with more reviews than
Wikipedia, with a tiny mobile team)

\* Machine Learning / data mining / recommendations - think Netflix
prize, but for books!

\* Big data and web infrastructure - we're big users of hive, impala,
and hadoop

\* Internships: junior standing or above for all areas of engineering.
We hire several interns every summer and year-round.

That said, we care way more about your personality and general hacking
skills then what languages you've used so far, so if you haven't used
these but want to break into mobile or web development, this could be a
good opportunity for you. We've hired people from these threads with
everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience.

We're profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office
environment (go-karts + a rock climbing wall!). Scribd alumni have gone
on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other
startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we
like to hire, and we love hiring people with entrepreneur and startup
ambitions. We are also always looking for international people
interested in moving to the US and can help you secure a visa.

      + Data Science Engineer
      + Mobile/Embedded Sensor Engineer
      + Product Manager

Placemeter is building a real-time data layer measuring activity in the
physical urban environment, like how many people are walking on an
intersection or how fast cars are speeding down your block. We use
computer vision at a massive scale, on a large number of rich and
ubiquitous video feeds, to understand what is going in in the physical
world in real time. We measure how busy places are, what people do, how
fast cars go, and much more. We offer that data to developers, citizens,
cities, and retailers, radically changing the way they interact with the
physical world.

We built our platform around privacy. We never store any video and we do
not identify people. We also make sure no one can reverse engineer our
data to identify anyone. We are backed by top NYC & Silicon Valley VCs,
alumna of TechStars (Spring 2013), and actively plugged into their
vibrant ecosystem of mentors and alumni.

We need creative and flexible minds, with a complete commitment to
building nothing else but perfect software and systems. Make a real
impact on your city, the NYC tech community, and a fast growing startup.

platform we are building.

 Charlie Contacts - Software Engineer - Chicago, IL

We're looking for a developer who thrives on solving complex problems
and learning new technology. You want to make an impact in an
early-stage company. You write killer back-end code, but don’t shy away
from the front-end.

We’ve built Charlie to research people at scale, using the latest Ruby
on Rails stack with MongoDB, Redis, Sidekiq, and hosted in an elastic
cloud farm. We write code with agility and have a tight process where
anyone on the team can deploy to production at any time, without
approval (it's near-continuous deployment). We thoroughly test our code,
though we’re not strict TDD. We pair program on more complex problems.
We're a small dev that loves to code, and constantly pushes, and learns
from each other.

Before any meeting, Charlie automatically researches people before you
see them. Researching people is a complex problem: we sift through,
analyze, and manipulate data into powerful insights (i.e. what are they
passionate about, what do you have in common?). CNBC called us “One of
the world’s most promising new companies” and SXSW selected us as an
Accelerator Finalist.

This is your opportunity to join an early-stage company that’s making
moves. Sound interesting? Let us know what makes you the perfect
candidate.

Why we’re special:

       * Flexible working situation: hours, location
       * Relaxed work environment
       * Competitive salary + equity
       * Funded startup backed by some amazing people
       * Everyone deploys to production (fully automated, painless)
       * We do fun things (concerts, Bulls & Cubs games, and occasionally ski in Colorado)

Requirements:

       * Backend developer
       * Ruby on Rails preferred, but you can learn.
       * DB experience (MongoDB preferred)
       * Not afraid of the front-end (HTML5, jQuery, Coffeescript, bootstrap, Sass, Slim)
       * Test your code (Rspec, capybara, cucumber, etc)
       * Codes on the side (you love to code, right?)
       * Creative problem solver
       * Git / Github
       * Smart & gets things done.

----------------------------------------------------

ABOUT 99GAMERS

Born off a Reddit post, 99Gamers is a fast growing community-driven
marketplace for gamers to buy and sell video games. So far we’ve had
over $800,000 worth of games sold, 80,000 members and 36,000 games
listed. Recently we’ve been experiencing higher growth (10,000+ members
in last week) and have a clear path to continue and increase this
growth.

----------------------------------------------------

CTO/POSSIBLE CO-FOUNDER POSITION

Join a small, quickly growing startup working to push the marketplace
space forward. You’ll help us get there. We’re looking for an
engineer/hacker who can head up the technical end and learn/grow with
the company on the go. As the technical lead, you will have ownership
and responsibility for product development.

You should place a very high personal value on culture. We’re looking
for a mellow coder with an insane work ethic. Open to students working
towards their degree in CS (or related) if you have real-world
experience with products shipped. The right candidate would become
99Gamers CTO and possibly a co-founder and will receive startup equity.

Experience with PHP is a big plus but not required if you have strong
experience with mobile app development (iOS, Android).

----------------------------------------------------

FULL STACK ENGINEER (PHP) POSITION

Should have:

\* Solid experience with PHP and MySQL

\* Experience working on personal/or open source projects

\* Experience with HTML/CSS/Javascript a plus

\* Mobile app development a plus (iOS, Android)

----------------------------------------------------

If interested, send a resume along with a brief note about why you think
you’d be a good fit at 99Gamers to brandon@99gamers.com. If you have any
questions, feel free to ask.

You'll also likely play a key role in developing a new API for several
key partners.

\2) We need someone with fierce tenacity to run QA and technical ad
operations. When an account manager sees that we recorded no clicks for
a certain campaign in Firefox browsers, you'll get to hunt down the
resolution. You'd bring a meticulous eye for detail to bear with browser
and Javascript chops. Done well, you'll be a daily hero. (As it turns
out, the folks writing "system code" perform best when they can stay in
the zone, head down as much as possible.) Count on becoming well
acquainted with Hive.

\3) Finally, we're looking for a strong DevOps team member. You know
networking and Linux very well. You'll help improve our Hadoop clusters.
You'll tune monitoring and alerting thresholds. Most importantly, you'll
eagerly seek to expand your usefulness as you work with the rest of the
dev team. We're not driven by dogma, and you'll find yourself in good
company if your sole priority is fixing the problem at hand.

I'm one of the lead devs, and you can reach me at dlarsen@connexity.com.
I'm happy to speak informally about our situation, and can hook you up
with the HR folk at the appropriate time.

Palo Alto, CA (careers@robinhood.com)

Robinhood started with a simple idea: using technology, we can re-think
the way financial services operate. We cut out the fat that makes other
financial services costly — legacy technology, hundreds of storefront
locations, and paper-based accounting. And as a result, we radically
reduce costs. Our team members have a diverse set of academic and
industry experiences from Stanford, MIT, Caltech, Pixar, Oracle, ETrade,
Bungie and Facebook.

\* iOS Engineer - We’re looking for an experienced iOS engineer to help
build the Robinhood iOS app, for both iPhone and iPad. This is truly a
next-generation trading app that takes advantage of all the newest iOS 7
and 8 features, while featuring a highly custom UI.

\* Web Engineer - We are seeking an experienced frontend web engineer to
help build the Robinhood web app, for both desktop and mobile. The
product features real-time, live-updating data and context-dependent
interfaces, so you’ll be building a very rich client-side web
application.

\* Backend Engineer - Robinhood is looking for an experienced backend
engineer to help build our brokerage web API. This includes systems such
as market data, trading, accounting, authentication, and security. An
ideal candidate would have previous experience designing RESTful APIs
and the backend systems that implement them.

\* Release Engineer - Robinhood is looking for an experienced release
engineer to develop systems and processes to deploy and monitor our
brokerage software. Technologies that we use include AWS, SaltStack,
Python, Django, Redis, and PostgreSQL. An ideal candidate would have
several years of experience with most or all of these technologies at a
world-class engineering organization.

 South Lake Tahoe (Zephyr Cove, NV)

Informa Investment Solutions, Inc. is seeking both a senior and a junior
developer to join our web applications team at our office on the shores
of Lake Tahoe. If you love designing and building modern, responsive web
applications that make it easy for business users to run sophisticated
investment analysis software, we would like to talk to you. We’re an
established company with actual paying customers and we want to make our
little corner of the world a better place for our users.

We use standards-based HTML, JavaScript and CSS, along with state of the
art technologies – Canvas, SVG, RequireJS, Backbone, Marionette, and
LESS – to build cross-browser interfaces and advanced data
visualizations. The backend is a mixture of C\#, Java, C++ because we
believe in using the right tool for the job, and we are regularly
evaluating our tools to ensure that. Our development process is agile

every aspect of the system.

do permit senior developers (5+ yrs. relevant experience) to work
remotely, but total travel time to the Zephyr office can be no longer
than 3 hours. If you're interested, please email matt.motherway -at-

 Zoomer (YC S14) - REMOTE

Zoomer is building a new take on food delivery - a platform to handle an
extraordinarily high volume of concurrent deliveries from restaurants
that already deliver (i.e. pizza, wings, sandwiches, etc.). We’re
bringing much needed change to local high-volume delivery restaurants
that are still doing delivery the way they’ve always done it. It's a
very interesting technology and logistics problem, quickly routing
orders to optimal drivers in near-real-time. Our CEO has a substantial
amount of experience in the space from his first startup.

In addition to Y Combinator, we are backed by some of the premier early
stage venture capital funds, including First Round Capital and SV Angel,
and awesome angel investors like Eric Ries & Gabriel Weinberg, the
founder of DuckDuckGo. This is your opportunity to get in on the
ground-floor. You would be engineer number 3 or 4. You’ll have a ton of
impact – lots of freedom to help us evolve our platform, stack, and
apps. We have strong dev practices, put an emphasis on testing, and
deploy rapidly.

Our stack: We have an AI backend service that handles order routing,
multiple mobile applications – for our drivers and restaurants, and
several Ruby on Rails applications for customer-facing/internal
services. We’re using Angular.js and CoffeeScript on the frontend.

The roles we’re hiring for:

      * Artificial Intelligence engineer
      * Data Science – roles open for data analysis and data infrastructure
      * Ruby on Rails engineers
      * Frontend engineer (Angular.js)
      * Mobile (iOS and Android) engineers
      * Infrastructure/DevOps engineer

 Context Matters, New York, NY - Hiring an engineer in NYC. Sorry, no

Context Matters is a platform that the world's largest pharmaceutical
companies use to make strategic drug development decisions. We're
looking to add another developer to our small team. If that sounds like
a good time to you, please check out the attached job description and
answer 3 short questions online at

DEVELOPER

We've built a platform that the world's largest pharmaceutical companies
use to make strategic drug development decisions. Members of our team
enjoy meaningful equity and a progressive, respectful environment. We
like having interests outside of work! Product Development has recently
transitioned from contractors to a small team in house and we're seeking
a third member. We tend to be pretty self-sufficient, but collaborate on
things like code review or UX. The ability to wear many hats is a plus –
but we might make fun of you if you mention being a “ninja.”

Responsibilities

• Write code that someone else is able to understand

• Design features that work & look good

• Have ideas: UX, technologies to use, be opinionated on the product

• Balance the ability to ship quickly with code quality and test
coverage

Requirements

• Experience developing applications with Ruby on Rails

• Demonstrable knowledge of front-end technologies: JavaScript, HTML,
CSS & jQuery

• Working knowledge of SQL

• Familiarity with testing (we use RSpec and Jasmine)

• Ubuntu / server admin knowledge a plus!

 MakeLeaps - Cloud Invoicing for Japan - REMOTE

Hi there - we're a startup based in Tokyo and we're looking for a
developer with Python/Django experience to join us as a full-time remote
staff member, with the possibility of coming to live in Tokyo to work
near/in the office.

We have a strong team consisting of 6 developers, a designer, and a
bunch of great customer support staff. We're getting some exciting
growth, traction, and users love our service.

We have a huge whiteboard full of exciting features we can't wait to get
started on, and we need your help to turn them into a reality, and to
help continue to delight our existing and future users.

We're mainly looking for Python/Django experience to start, but if
you've got a wide variety of skills, it always helps to be a generalist
in a startup.

To apply, can you please send me some information about some business
apps you've worked on in the past. Ideally anything relating to business
processes/quotes/invoices/accounting is great, but is not necessary,
since we believe that a cultural fit is just as important as technical
skill.

We'd offer a trial to start with, and then if we're both happy with how
we work together, we'd offer you a full-time position.

Please send me an email directly at jay@makeleaps.com - I'm one of the
founders. Looking forward to chatting with you!

(We also organise the Hacker News community meetups in Tokyo, so if
you're planning on traveling to Japan and want to get a feel for the
startup community here, see if there's a meetup going on at
hntokyo.doorkeeper.jp)

 Thread.com (YC S12) - Software engineer who loves product
(Python/Django) London, England.
[https://www.thread.com/jobs](https://www.thread.com/jobs)

We're a startup trying to reinvent retail so men can dress well without
being subject to the horrors of the high street or having to trawl
through millions of items online. We do this using a combination of
powerful algorithms and human stylists.

You'd be joining a small, highly technical team with a ton of startup
experience (the founders have started and sold 2 companies before).
You'll be one of the first technical hires and get to build and own huge
parts of the product and work on the core algorithms.

One of our ancillary goals is to build one of the best engineering
cultures anywhere, and we'd love you to help us do that. We launched in
October and user and revenue numbers are scaling extremely quickly.
We're backed by a collection of the top investors from London and
Silicon Valley as well as Y Combinator.

We're especially interested in people who are interested in founding
their own startup one day. We view working at Thread as a founder
bootcamp where you'll learn about all parts of starting and growing a
startup.

Want to learn more? Check out

 Nokia/HERE (Formerly Navteq) — Chicago

As an organization, we have a long history with map data. Now we’re
looking at interesting ways to use it to change driving. Cars of the
future (and present) have onboard computers, tons of sensors, and
internet connections over the cell network. If you could hook that up to
our map data, you could do some really cool things.

To see what we’re up to, check out
[http://360.here.com/tag/connected-driving/](http://360.here.com/tag/connected-driving/)

We’re looking for strong Java developers to make this happen. Experience
with AWS, apache storm, stream processing or high volume, low-latency
applications are all plusses.

The things I’ve enjoyed most since starting here a few months ago:

- Interesting problem space

- Interesting tech stack

- I get to wear sandals to work

- Team running group that goes for a run together every Wednesday
morning before lunch

- Company gym

- Quickly-growing team

- Good medical insurance coverage

- Starting a lunch time study group (with lunch provided by the
company!)

Interested? Questions? Email me at roman.zabicki@here.com I'd love to
talk to you.

 BetterCompany - San Francisco

BetterCompany is a seed stage startup based in SF's financial district.
The company is well-funded by some of the best enterprise angels and VCs
in the business
([https://angel.co/bettercompany](https://angel.co/bettercompany)).

Our app facilitates anonymous sharing within companies. Getting feedback
in the workplace is hard. Suggestion boxes suck, 360 reviews suck,
questionnaires from HR suck. We can do better. Although we monetize with
paying enterprise customers, our focus is on creating a product loved
and trusted by individuals.

We're looking for solid developers to work on all aspects of the app.
Experience with node.js, Python, Objective-C, Java, client-side
Javascript or Linux would be directly relevant, but we're also
interested in hackers with experience with "mind-expanding"
technologies, like Lisp, Smalltalk, Erlang, Haskell etc.

We're also looking for a security engineer—someone who can audit the
codebase, find and fix vulnerabilities and evaluate proposed features
for their security impact.

If you're interested, contact me at colin@bettercompany.co

 PACKETZOOM ENGINEERING Burlingame, CA (just south of San Francisco in
the bay area) FULL TIME H1B VISA Transfer ok TN VISA ok. REMOTE
considered for the perfect candidate

Mobile Networks are different. And yet we continue using the same legacy
protocol stack (TCP/HTTP/SSL) to connect mobile devices to the cloud. If
you want to help change that, come join us.

Packetzoom is rethinking the whole stack from the ground up. You get to
hack network and/or security protocols, innards of mobile operating
systems and build a global distributed system around brand new
protocols.

We're currently looking for

- ANDROID PLATFORM LEVEL ENGINEER

You'd be responsible for our Android platform SDK (so you'd be writing
some combination of Java and C++ code). In the process, you'd get to
learn all about vagaries of mobile platforms and mobile networks at the
global scale. In addition, you'll have your pick of dozens of delicious,
hard problems to solve in the realm of distributed systems, unix'y
things, iOS stuff (to be compatible on both platforms), security etc.

I'm Founder/CEO/CTO. You will work directly with me. We're well funded
but still a very small team (< 10 people) So you get to enjoy an early
stage team environment but not so much the high financial risk that goes
with such things. Contact me directly at chetan at packetzoom.com

 Rinse - [https://www.rinse.com](https://www.rinse.com) - San Francisco,
CA

Rinse is a technology-enabled dry cleaning and laundry delivery service.
Our customers use a mobile app, our website, or SMS to schedule a
delivery, and then we use sophisticated software and processes to 'level
up' what is still mostly a pen-and-paper industry. We've been growing
exponentially for a year now; if you live in SF and haven't heard of us,
you will soon!

We're hiring a senior software developer to solve problems ranging from
the capacitated vehicle routing problem to image processing to linux
kiosks. We're primarily Django + Bootstrap.js with a healthy dose of
Celery + Heroku + Ubuntu. Big bonus points if you have history in the
industry!

We're also hiring a Customer Experience Specialist. No technical skills
are necessary for this role, but you'll need well-developed empathy and
solid written and verbal communication skills. We have absolutely
stellar customer satisfaction and retention statistics, and we aim to
keep it that way! If you want to join a rapidly-growing startup in San
Francisco, but aren't an elite hacker, here's your chance!

If you have any questions about either of these roles, please do not
hesitate to email me directly at sam <at\> rinse.com

Renovo is building extremely high performance electric vehicles in
Campbell, CA.

This company was started by some friends of mine and I have been working
with them as a "side project", building the back end data collection
platform (modern cars generate a ton of low level data). They are
growing fast and are now in need of a skilled full stack software
engineer to take this MVP to the next level. The current platform is a
mixture of open software (linux, influxdb) and Java. So far on this
project I have worked on debugging device drivers to building graphs in
D3.js and everything in between. The right person will not only have a
huge impact on the choice of languages and direction of the platform but
potentially the electric car industry. Local south-bay preferred, but
the right person could work remotely.

Fanout makes it easy to build realtime applications and APIs.

We operate a distributed cloud service for delivering data in realtime
via a variety of transport mechanisms: REST, HTTP streaming, WebSockets,
Webhooks, XMPP. Useful for creating applications like chat, sports
updates, stock tickers, games, and collaborative applications.

You're a backend engineer who is passionate about realtime technologies,
network protocols, and open standards. You hate silos and walled
gardens. You have opinions about when to use event-driven vs threaded
programming patterns. You lie awake at night thinking about how to
optimize out network round trips. You might even know assembly language,
or did in a past life.

Also, our code is almost entirely open source! You should think that's
pretty incredible.

[http://fanout.io/open/](http://fanout.io/open/)

Important pieces of our stack: C++ & Python/Django, ZeroMQ, Mongrel2,
Redis.

Your job:

- Help us build out and scale our distributed cloud service.

- Squeeze the most value out of our servers.

- Make the service bulletproof.

- Gloat about how you get paid to code publicly on GitHub.

 SwiftStack - Hiring London, UK - Full Time / Contract

SwiftStack builds a delivery and monitoring platform around OpenStack
Swift. Our product manages some of the largest installations out there,
and with a recent expansion into the UK we have a large customer who
will need some more localized help. SwiftStack is headquartered in San
Francisco, however a number of us work from remote locations throughout
the US and Asia Pacific. This will be a similar role in the UK.

In particular this position will be directly involved with a specific UK
customer and will be on-site a few days a week. You will be the liaison
for this customer back to the "mothership". The role will be half
technical and half customer facing.

Knowledge of large storage systems and OpenStack Swift a plus, but in
particular someone with a good knowledge of Linux systems administration
and deployment is likely to be able to pick up on what they need to know
rather quickly.

The position will also involve travel to outside of Manchester UK on a
semi-regular basis. Travel expenses will be covered.

Looking for someone for full time or on contract for 12 months.

Please hit me up if you're interested in learning more. I would be glad
to share more information and get to learn more about you!

 Crimson Hexagon - Boston

We use machine learning techniques to make sense of a vast reservoir of
social data. As one of the few companies with direct access to the
Twitter Firehose as well as the full Facebook and Google+ APIs, we face
unique UI problems that you'll help solve with your keen sense of design
and attention to detail. You'll be architecting new features and
workflows that our customers will use to pull valuable insight out of
hundreds of billions of social media posts.

There's no precedent for a lot of what we do. Familiarity with modern
JavaScript frameworks is a plus, but not a requisite-- We value your
ability to think laterally, collaborate, communicate, and execute above
everything. We like people who have a background in freelancing. We also
like people who come to programming via nontraditional means.

Top pay, top benefits, located in Boston's Seaport district. We're big
enough not to be a monoculture, but small enough not to be a corporate
cult.

startup in Austin, TX. Our team is top-notch, coming from previous
Austin successes like Bazaarvoice, HomeAway, RetailMeNot, & Mutual
Mobile. We've raised $1.5M of seed funding earlier this year on our
prototype and are heads down building out features and our mobile
applications.

We use Python (flask), DynamoDB, and Cloudsearch on top of AWS for our
API, and backbone.js powers our front-end application. A Cordova mobile
app is coming soon for Android and iOS. Our ideal candidate is
experienced with building Python APIs but is capable and interested in

 SEATTLE, WA. Tired of pushing ephemeral bits? Come help us push
trainloads of shipping containers.

At AMP we are dragging the supply chain management away from paper
catalogs / order forms linked by U.S. Mail / fax to a modern tablet +
SaaS architecture.

Our user engagement has gone up dramatically in the recent months so
we're doing something right. But there is still ton of new code to be
written, and a huge impact to be made on the trajectory and velocity of
our startup.

We're looking for people with experience in frontend web development and
hopefully some visual design background (or at least ability to take
direction from our designer). So, HTML/CSS/JavaScript/{React|MVC of your
choice}. Our backend is ASP.NET MVC, it would be great if you could
pitch in there as well.

Additional experience with Logistics, Ecommerce, Payments, Wholesaling,
Retailing, is greately appreciated.

 Clay.io is hiring a full-stack engineer that loves games. This is
someone we'll eventually want to shift toward a role of VP of
Engineering as we expand the team.

Shoot me an email: austin@clay.io

About Us -------- We're redefining gaming on mobile. The primary means
of discovery for games is through the app stores, which we think is a
bad approach... There should be a Steam equivalent on mobile and that's
what we're working on. We're already reaching 4 million people every
month and just getting started.

We're a small team with a huge passion for games. We're all technical
and big fans of open source, so a good chunk of what you write will be
public on GitHub.

Our Stack --------- Node.js, CoffeeScript, MySQL, MongoDB, HTML5,
Ansible, Docker, Gulp, ...

 iRobot ([http://www.irobot.com](http://www.irobot.com)) - Bedford, MA
(just outside of Boston, MA) and Pasadena, CA

Looking for great work-life balance at a job where you can say "I can't
find my keyboard under all these robots!" ? Want a place with half-day
Fridays during the summer so you can get to the beach on a Friday
afternoon? Then iRobot might be the place for you.

We blend cutting-edge research and practical engineering to build useful
and affordable robots.

We're looking for smart engineers who are easy to work with. You should
probably think robots are cool, but a robotics background is NOT
required. (I had no robotics background when I started at iRobot.)

iRobot is looking for software engineers and mechanical engineers.

Here are a few of our 20+ job openings:

\* Embedded software engineers: We're hiring for "big embedded" (C++,
Linux, and big cpus) and "small embedded" (C, bare-metal, small cpus).
If you have good OO skills (C++, Java, etc.) but no "embedded"
background that's okay too - shoot me an email and we'll chat.

\* Software engineers for vision, navigation, and mapping

\* Test engineers

\* Mechanical engineers

\* IT engineers

\* UX/UI engineers

Check our jobs site for all positions:
[http://www.irobot.com/us/Company/Careers.aspx](http://www.irobot.com/us/Company/Careers.aspx)

Email me directly if you'd like to know more: csvec@irobot.com

Please email even if you're not sure if you're a match; I'm always happy
to talk to other HN'ers!

 MeetMe - New Hope, PA (near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) -
[http://www.meetme.com](http://www.meetme.com)

See all public openings here:
[http://jobvite.com/m?3SzvEgwl](http://jobvite.com/m?3SzvEgwl)

About Us: MeetMe is the leading social network for meeting new people in
the US with over 1 million DAU. We've been around since 2005 as
myYearbook, rebranding in 2012 as MeetMe. We've launched other apps such
as Focal, Choosy, Charm, and Unsaid in the past, and are looking to
continue adding more standalone apps in the future.

We use a wide variety of languages, generally using what makes sense. C,
PHP, Python, JavaScript and Node.js, and native iOS and Android
development are the most common.

MeetMe is a fun place to work. We hold a yearly developer retreat, as
well as regular company-wide hackathons. We have a book club, board game
club, and we even have a game room. And our summer hours last all year
round.

While we aren't a new company in the time scale of the internet, we
still know how to have fun. We just get the benefit of not having to
kill ourselves working 12 hour days. =) This means you'll enjoy actually
going home on time! We have many openings, both technical and
non-technical. Here is a list of positions we are usually always looking
for.

\* Senior Android Developer

\* Software iOS Developer

\* Network Engineer

You can apply directly here:
[http://jobvite.com/m?3SzvEgwl](http://jobvite.com/m?3SzvEgwl)

Or you can contact me at jlotito@meetme.com. I'm a developer, so feel
free to ask specific developer-type questions.

 Pretty much every bitcoin company out there. There's close to a quarter
billion dollars of VC funding pouring in and it's very much a global
phenomenon in every continent. A lot of reputable companies, two of
which have had $150m valuations (the first two on the following list)
earlier this year.

e.g. Coinbase, Bitpay, Circle, Blockchain.info.

Mostly engineering, backend, frontend, web & native apps, a fair bit of
security and UX, too.

Check out coinality.com for example for lots of jobs, lots of stuff on
Angel List too.
