TL;DR in this article I show how to use [git
crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) to store sensitive data in a
git repo. I describe the steps using the context of my dotfiles
repository but the same thing can be done to store any other kind of
sensitive data inside any other git repository.

The context
-----------

In [my previous
article](http://www.twinbit.it/en/blog/your-dotfiles-and-you) I showed
how to use a git repository to store your dotfiles. Someone [in the
comments](http://www.twinbit.it/en/blog/your-dotfiles-and-you#comment-1258122489)
pointed out the fact that you should pay attention not to commit
sensitive data inside your dotfiles repo.

Indeed, dotfiles usually end up containing several pieces of sensitive
data related to your company or your clients. Examples of this are
***ssh private keys***, ***aws certificates***, ***api credentials***,
... The list goes on, inside your personal dotfiles repo you may also
want to store personal data like your password wallet data.

In this article I will describe how to store sensitive data in your
dotfiles git repo, but this is just an example, you can use the approach
outlined here to store any other kind of sensitive data inside any other
git repository.

The way I solved this issue in the past was to use another "private"
repository, nested inside the main one as a submodule.\
 As you can see [from this old blob
content](https://github.com/grota/dotfiles/blob/eb2e895b940dc10f47363bc11c1e2e7cd26d7e43/.gitmodules#L73)
the submodule was actually a bare repository whose content was synced
using Dropbox.

*"Hosting"* a personal bare repo using Dropbox is actually not a problem
if you are the only one using it since there are no race condition or
publication issues. The problem with that approach was security: anyone
at Dropbox HQ, or anyone managing to get their hands on my backups could
potentially access my files.

So I started looking into using
[git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt), to perform the same
task.

### A small disclaimer

Now before continuing, a small disclaimer: **I'm not an expert in
security and cryptography**, please let me know in the comments below
what are the weaknesses using this approach.

Using [git crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt)
----------------------------------------------------

Here's the project description copied verbatim:

> git-crypt enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a
> git\
>  repository. Files which you choose to protect are encrypted when
> committed,\
>  and decrypted when checked out. git-crypt lets you freely share a
> repository\
>  containing a mix of public and private content. git-crypt gracefully\
>  degrades, so developers without the secret key can still clone and
> commit to\
>  a repository with encrypted files. This lets you store your secret
> material\
>  (such as keys or passwords) in the same repository as your code,
> without\
>  requiring you to lock down your entire repository.

Using git crypt is pretty straightforward and well documented on the
project page. The usage scenarios are as follows:

1.  **An initial step:**\
     Execute `git crypt keygen /path/to/keyfile` to generate a
    cryptographic key used for symmetric encryption/decription.\
     The key then has to be stored securely somewhere else.
2.  **Configure the repository to use this key:**\
     Execute `git crypt init /path/to/keyfile`.\
     Git-crypt uses the smudge/clean facilities. This step writes into
    the repo's `.git/config` file the entries `filter.git-crypt.smudge`,
    `filter.git-crypt.clean` and `diff.git-crypt.textconv` which you can
    look up using for example `git config filter.git-crypt.clean`.
3.  **Specify what files need to be encrypted:**\
     This is done preparing one or more `.gitattributes` files and
    checking them in. You want for example to crypt all the files ending
    in `.ssh` you would commit the following `.gitattributes` file:

<!-- -->

    # .gitattributes example file
    *.ssh filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt

If another developer clones your repo he only needs to do *step 2*
above; failing that he will only be able to access the encrypted version
of the files (an unintelligible blob).

A git repo entirely dedicated to sensitive data
-----------------------------------------------

Git-crypt uses `.gitattributes` so that you can (but also must)
explicitly specify what files you want to commit encrypted.\
 This approach seemed too much error prone for my use case because even
if you specify a glob pattern like `private/*`, a file like
`private/subdir/file` does not match that pattern and is commited into
git unencrypted.

To avoid this problem I wanted to have a git repository where I was sure
that every file was commited encrypted. So I [fell back using the
submodule
approach](https://github.com/grota/dotfiles/blob/77ba94827c618511758810fca98df3cceb728c4e/.gitmodules#L184);
you can take a look at the repo
[here](https://github.com/grota/git-crypt).

The most important thing is the root level
[`.gitattributes`](https://github.com/grota/git-crypt/blob/b1ea4992b525d259af92ea0cd76e07a9762a80f0/.gitattributes):
it defaults to crypt everything except the `.gitmodules` and the
`.gitattributes` file themselves:

    # .gitattributes file
    * filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
    .gitattributes !filter !diff
    .gitmodules !filter !diff

As you can see [this
file](https://github.com/grota/git-crypt/blob/master/ikiwiki/README.txt)
for example was commited as an encrypted blob, even if it is just a
plain text file in its unencrypted form.

### Abusing git-crypt

On the `LIMITATIONS` section of git-crypt's README it states:

> git-crypt is not designed to encrypt an entire repository. Not only
> does\
>  that defeat the aim of git-crypt, which is the ability to
> selectively\
>  encrypt files and share the repository with less-trusted developers,
> there\
>  are probably better, more efficient ways to encrypt an entire
> repository,\
>  such as by storing it on an encrypted filesystem.\
>  ...\
>  git-crypt does not itself provide any authentication. It assumes
> that\
>  either the master copy of your repository is stored securely, or
> that\
>  you are using git's existing facilities to ensure integrity (signed
> tags,\
>  remembering commit hashes, etc.).

I actually wanted a git repo where each file was encrypted, and at the
same time I wanted an offsite backup system with a remote in the
"cloud": git-crypt with its clean/smudge approach (and a simple
`git push`) provided a solution with very few moving parts.
