How to Make Yourself Work When You Just Don’t Want To
=====================================================

There’s that project you’ve left on the backburner – the one with the
deadline that’s growing uncomfortably near. And there’s the client whose
phone call you really should return – the one that does nothing but
complain and eat up your valuable time. Wait, weren’t you going to try
to go to the gym more often this year?

Can you imagine how much less guilt, stress, and frustration you would
feel if you could somehow just make yourself do the things you don’t
want to do when you are actually supposed to do them? Not to mention how
much happier and more effective you would be?

The good news (and its very good news) is that you can get better about
not putting things off, if you use the right strategy. Figuring out
which strategy to use depends on why you are procrastinating in the
first place:

**Reason \#1 You are putting something off because you are afraid you
will screw it up.**

Solution: Adopt a “prevention focus.”

There are two ways to look at any task. You can do something because you
see it as a way to *end up better off than you are now* – as an
achievement or accomplishment. As in, *if I complete this project
successfully I will impress my boss,*or *if I work out regularly I will
look amazing*. Psychologists call this a **promotion focus** – and
research shows that when you have one, you are motivated by the thought
of making gains, and work best when you feel eager and optimistic.
Sounds good, doesn’t it? Well, if you are afraid you will screw up on
the task in question, this is *not* the focus for you. Anxiety and doubt
undermine promotion motivation, leaving you less likely to take any
action at all.

What you need is a way of looking at what you need to do that isn’t
undermined by doubt – ideally, one that thrives on it. When you have a
**prevention focus**, instead of thinking about how you can end up
better off, you see the task as a way to *hang on to what you’ve already
got* – to avoid loss. For the prevention-focused, successfully
completing a project is a way to keep your boss from being angry or
thinking less of you. Working out regularly is a way to not “let
yourself go.” Decades of research, which I describe in my book *Focus*,
shows that prevention motivation is actually enhanced by anxiety about
what might go wrong. When you are focused on avoiding loss, it becomes
clear that the only way to get out of danger is to take immediate
action. The more worried you are, the faster you are out of the gate.

I know this doesn’t sound like a barrel of laughs, particularly if you
are usually more the promotion-minded type, but there is probably no
better way to get over your anxiety about screwing up than to give some
serious thought to all the dire consequences of doing nothing at all. Go
on, scare the pants off yourself. It feels awful, but it works.

**Reason \#2 You are putting something off because you don’t “feel” like
doing it.**

Solution: Make like Spock and ignore your feelings. They’re getting in
your way.

In his excellent book *The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can’t
Stand Positive Thinking*, Oliver Burkeman points out that much of the
time, when we say things like “I just can’t get out of bed early in the
morning, “ or “I just can’t get myself to exercise,” what we really mean
is that we can’t get ourselves to *feel* like doing these things. After
all, no one is tying you to your bed every morning. Intimidating
bouncers aren’t blocking the entrance to your gym. Physically, nothing
is stopping you – you just don’t feel like it. But as Burkeman asks,
“Who says you need to wait until you ‘feel like’ doing something in
order to start doing it?”

Think about that for a minute, because it’s really important. Somewhere
along the way, we’ve all bought into the idea – without consciously
realizing it – that to be motivated and effective we need to *feel* like
we want to take action. We need to be eager to do so. I really don’t
know why we believe this, because it is 100% nonsense. Yes, on some
level you need to be committed to what you are doing – you need to want
to see the project finished, or get healthier, or get an earlier start
to your day. But you don’t need to *feel like doing it.*

In fact, as Burkeman points out, many of the most prolific artists,
writers, and innovators have become so in part because of their reliance
on work routines that forced them to put in a certain number of hours a
day, no matter how uninspired (or, in many instances, hungover) they
might have felt. Burkeman reminds us of renowned artist Chuck Close’s
observation that “Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show
up and get to work.”

So if you are sitting there, putting something off because you don’t
feel like it, remember that you don’t actually need to feel like it.
*There is nothing stopping you.*

**Reason \#3 You are putting something off because it’s hard, boring, or
otherwise unpleasant.**

Solution: Use if-then planning.

Too often, we try to solve this particular problem with sheer will:
*Next time, I will **make**myself start working on this sooner.* Of
course, if we actually *had* the willpower to do that, we would never
put it off in the first place. Studies show that people routinely
overestimate their capacity for self-control, and rely on it too often
to keep them out of hot water.

Do yourself a favor, and embrace the fact that your willpower is
limited, and that it may not always be up to the challenge of getting
you to do things you find difficult, tedious, or otherwise awful.
Instead, use ***if-then planning*** to get the job done.

Making an *if-then* plan is more than just deciding what specific steps
you need to take to complete a project – it’s also deciding *where* and
*when* you will take them.

***If****it is 2pm, **then**I will stop what I’m doing and start work on
the report Bob asked for.*

***If****my boss doesn’t mention my request for a raise at our meeting,
**then** I will bring it up again before the meeting ends.*

By deciding in advance *exactly*what you’re going to do, and when and
where you’re going to do it, there’s no deliberating when the time
comes. No *do I really have to do this now*?, or *can this wait till
later?* or *maybe I should do something else instead*. It’s when we
deliberate that willpower becomes necessary to make the tough choice.
But if-then plans dramatically reduce the demands placed on your
willpower, by ensuring that you’ve made the *right* decision way ahead
of the critical moment. In fact, *if-then* planning has been shown in
over 200 studies to increase rates of goal attainment and productivity
by 200%-300% on average.

I realize that the three strategies I’m offering you – thinking about
the consequences of failure, ignoring your feelings, and engaging in
detailed planning – don’t sound as fun as advice like “Follow your
passion!” or “Stay positive!” But they have the decided advantage of
actually being*effective –*which, as it happens, is exactly what you’ll
be if you use them.
