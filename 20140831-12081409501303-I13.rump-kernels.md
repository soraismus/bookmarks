status and where rump kernels are headed

    Hi,

    With the bare metal platform running smoothly both on actual hardware 
    and popular hypervisors, now is a good time to see where we are and 
    where we're going.  In addition to facts, this mail contains some 
    envisioning.

    My prediction is that over time the significance of operating systems as 
    we know them will diminish.  I expect that as we move more and more from 
    computers to computing devices and the cloud, more and more people will 
    realize that they are running traditional operating systems only for 
    drivers, and simply do not need an operating system.  The need for 
    drivers will of course remain, as they are needed to interoperate.  What 
    I do not believe will go away either are, for better or worse, the 
    POSIX-like application interfaces, at least not for a very long time. 
    There is simply too much software for that environment to start 
    rewriting it from scratch.

    About a year ago, rump kernels had solid support for POSIXy userspace 
    platforms and offered the syscall interface.  Since then, not only have 
    we seen support for multiple different and different types of platforms 
    (more on that later), but also going from offering just the syscall 
    interface to an almost full POSIXy application interface.  That's quite 
    a leap!  Of course, the whole "userspace" part of the rump kernel stack 
    (*) is still completely optional, giving a good degree of flexibility.

    *) by "userspace" I mean the three top boxes in this diagram:
    http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/pooka/images/baremetal-rumpstack.png

    I like to think of rump kernels as being capable of running on four 
    different kinds of platforms:

    1) hosted, e.g. userspace
    2) paravirtualized, e.g. Xen
    3) "bare metal", e.g. hardware or hypervisor with virtio
    4) microkernels (as servers)

    The lines between the four are not always completely clear, for example 
    the "microkernel" approach I have most experience with is running 
    drivers as userspace servers on NetBSD, which clearly falls also into 
    "1".  I'll not go into technical details and thread splitting in this 
    mail, but the above taxonomy gives at least some indication.

    All of the above puts rump kernels in a pretty sweet spot.  We get all 
    of the reuse potential of kernelside drivers, POSIXy userspace interface 
    and, though we're not providing it directly, everything else commonly 
    thrown in userspace.  All of this is up for liberal chopping, mixing and 
    blending by users building applications and products on top.  As was 
    demonstrated with the bare metal platform, you can literally write a 
    case-specific OS in a week when you don't have to worry about porting or 
    hacking drivers.  In that respect, I see rump kernels more of as an 
    enabling technology instead of the end result.

    So what's in store for the future, then?  As far as I am concerned, 
    there are no big rototills immediately coming up.  Instead, in the near 
    term we, or at least I, will concentrate on application use cases and 
    improving usability.  For the past year, we have been trying to figure 
    out how to implement a rough idea.  The rough idea is starting to look 
    clearer, and a rough (but working) implementation exists too.  Now all 
    that remains is polishing.  The good thing about polishing is that 
    people familiar with Makefiles, build processes and shell scripts on 
    regular operating systems will find themselves right at home; it's a 
    convenient gateway for exploring the transition from the old style of OS 
    to the new style of lack of OS.

    As an example of something to investigate, a few people have suggested 
    hosting rumpkernel.org website on a rump kernel (well, the future 
    hopefully-soon-to-be-website).  In addition to the obvious 
    eat-our-own-dogfood value, the lessons learned from such an operation 
    would be invaluable in helping others repeat a similar operation.

    cheers,
       antti
