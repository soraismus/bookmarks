Functional Pearls 2.5 – Derivatives of Types
--------------------------------------------

This post is not only extremely late, its also a bit of a cop-out. [Last
time](http://caffeinatedcode.wordpress.com/2008/09/09/functional-pearls-2-the-zipper/)
I said I would write about derivatives of types. This is a cop-out in
the sense that its a bit more “overview”-ish than I would have liked,
but I did not find a way around that without making the whole thing
unacceptably long. So think of this as a way to get a feel for what’s
going on, and if you want more details you can always look at the
[paper](http://strictlypositive.org/diff.pdf)

Zippers again
=============

We’ll start with a simple binary tree:

    data BTree = Leaf | BTree (BTree, BTree)

Notice that this is a “bare” tree – only structure, no data. But it will
do for our purposes. Now you’ll remember that in a Zipper, we had a
subtree which was the focus of attention, and a *Path* which represented
“everything else”. The Path itself was a series of steps, going one
level down at a time. It is this notion of “step” that we are going to
capture i.e. how do you represent the “context” of an *immediate*
subtree of this tree. You can then do this multiple times to get the
complete Path used in the zipper.

This should be clearer by refering to the BTree example. The “step” type
here is:

    Bool * BTree

The `Bool` tells us whether we are in the left or the right branch, and
the `BTree` is the **other** branch i.e. the one we *didn’t* take. The
Path essentially consists of a series of these steps, one for each level
that we have descended.

Now lets be a little loose and write the definition for `BTree` as
follows:

or

Here we are ignoring the data constructors, and just thinking about the
types themselves. And here’s the trick: Think of this as an algebraic
expression, and differentiate it wrt
![BTree](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=BTree&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "BTree")
(which is now a variable in this expression) as you would have in high
school.

But `Bool = True | False` or in our notation `1 + 1`. This means that
the “derivative” has given us exactly the step type we were looking for!

This was not just a lucky example. McBride found that the rules of
differentiation can be applied (unchanged) to types (including rules for
products, the chain rule etc.), and they always gave the “correct” step
type. That good ol’ Leibniz should have anything to say about type
theory is really a remarkable coincidence. Or is it?

Details, details
================

Now in the above section (and too an extent in this entire post) I’ve
glossed over some things which are worth going into. For example, what
sort of types can we differentiate? (“regular” types) Functional types
as well? (no). What exactly does differentiation mean? The notation I am
using to describe types also needs to be explicitly defined, we need to
worry about variable capture, etc. etc. I cannot go into all that here,
but hopefully the notation makes sense intuitively so I’ll only deal
with some of the details.

I had asked you to accept that a `BTree` could be defined as ![1 +
BTree\^2](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%2B+BTree%5E2&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "1 + BTree^2").
This is in fact incorrect, because ![BTree = 1 +
BTree\^2](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=BTree+%3D+1+%2B+BTree%5E2&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "BTree = 1 + BTree^2")
doesn’t make too much sense (and in fact tempts me to solve the
quadratic and conclude that ![BTree = (-1 +
\\sqrt{3}i)/2](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=BTree+%3D+%28-1+%2B+%5Csqrt%7B3%7Di%29%2F2&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "BTree = (-1 + \sqrt{3}i)/2")
or some such!).

McBride defines such *recursive* types using a [least fixed
point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_fixed_point)

But then, why did I differentiate ![1 +
BTree\^2](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%2B+BTree%5E2&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "1 + BTree^2")
instead of ![\\mu(x).(1 +
x\^2)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu%28x%29.%281+%2B+x%5E2%29&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "\mu(x).(1 + x^2)")?

Here’s why: Taking a derivative is more general than calculating a step
type (think about non-recursive types. “Step type” is meaningless there,
but you can still take a derivative). What
![dF/dx](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=dF%2Fdx&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "dF/dx")
really does, is it punches a “hole” for an element
![x](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "x") in
a container
![F](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "F").
This gives us the “context” or the surroundings of that element – i.e.
the hole tells us where this element “fits” into the larger type. For
recursive types like `BTree` suppose we punch a hole at a particular
level (in this example, in ![1 +
x\^2](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%2B+x%5E2&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "1 + x^2")).
Here, the container is one level in the tree, and the element is the
*immediate subtree*. By punching a hole for this element we get what
we’ve been calling the “step type”. So for step types we don’t
differentiate the tree, but rather one level of the tree.

Just to make this clearer, consider the type `[String]`. We can
represent this with a fixed point:

Now, I haven’t given you the differentiation rule for
![\\mu](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "\mu")
(the chain rule is involved here!) so accept for the moment that:

    d[String]/dString "is isomorphic to" [String]*[String]

Where “is isomorphic to” means that syntactically differentiating
`[String]` will give us an expression which is “essentially the same as”
`[String]*[String]`

Notice that this result makes sense: The context of a String in a list
of Strings *should be* a pair of strings: the list of its predecessors
and the list of its successors.

On the other hand, `[String]` is a recursively defined type. So I could
consider its “step type”. This would be:

Again, this makes sense. If a step is a
![String](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=String&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "String"),
then a sequence of these steps will give us back the list of Strings. By
the way it makes **no** sense to differentiate something of the form
![\\mu(x).F](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu%28x%29.F&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "\mu(x).F")
with respect to
![x](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "x").
Why?

Doing this for real
===================

I’ve been busy implementing this in [Template Haskell]() (although for a
different purpose). McBride’s types don’t map directly to Haskell types
so there are some problems, but they’re quite easy to circumvent. For
one thing you’ll notice that McBride dispenses with data constructors,
but we have to keep track of them if we are to “plug in” an element back
into its context. But this is not really a “problem”. There are other
niggles such as the fact that McBride does not deal with parametrized
types, or mutually recursive types (directly). On the other hand
something like
![x\*(y+z)](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2A%28y%2Bz%29&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "x*(y+z)")
cannot be expressed directly in Haskell: it will have to be broken up
into something like
![x\*a](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Aa&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "x*a")
and
![a=y+z](http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3Dy%2Bz&bg=161410&fg=999999&s=-3 "a=y+z")
(with data constructors).

But really the biggest problem in the implementation has been Template
Haskell itself. Don’t get me wrong: TH is actually quite nice and very,
very powerful. Its just that Haskell AST’s are complicated, and you need
a bit of time to get used to using the TH system (btw if you’re looking
to learn TH I recommend these:
[http://www.haskell.org/bz/thdoc.htm](http://www.haskell.org/bz/thdoc.htm)
and
[http://www.haskell.org/bz/th3.htm](http://www.haskell.org/bz/th3.htm)
are great).

I guess Lisp’s simpler syntax is a huge gain as far as macro systems are
concerned. Also I’m guessing you wouldn’t get stuck inside the quotation
monad there since impure functions are OK?

Anyway it’ll be some time before I can put up the derivative code since
it is a part of something else, but TH usage has given me some
interesting ideas for other projects. It really is quite powerful!

===================

If you want things to be more precise, you’ll have to look at McBride’s
[paper](http://strictlypositive.org/diff.pdf). You might also want to
look at “dissection” of types, which is the next logical step in a
sense. But in any case, I **highly** recommend
[this](http://sigfpe.blogspot.com/2008/06/blessed-mans-formula-for-holey.html)
post on sigfpe’s excellent blog. It really makes you think about how
deep this connection between might be. Is it all just an artifact of our
notation? Which of the results and concepts from differential calculus
have meaning in the world of types? Could we assign some meaning to
integration (other than just inverse differentiation)? Some pretty
interesting questions here – any answers?
