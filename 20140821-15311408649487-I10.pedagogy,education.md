We Don't Need No Education
==========================

At least not of the traditional, compulsory, watch-the-clock-until-the-bell-rings kind. As a growing movement of unschoolers believe, a steady diet of standardized testing and indoor inactivity is choking the creativity right out of our kids. The alternative: set 'em free.

In early September, in a clapboard house situated on 43 acres just
outside a small town in northern Vermont, two boys awaken. They are
brothers; the older is 12, the younger 9, and they rise to a day that
has barely emerged from the clutches of dark. It is not yet autumn, but
already the air has begun to change, the soft nights of late summer
lengthening and chilling into the season to come. Outside the boys’
bedroom window, the leaves on the maples are just starting to turn.

[![image](http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/outside.adventure/nature;page=unschooling-the-case-for-setting-your-kids-into-the-wild;tile=1;pos=1;sz=300x250;sec=;dcopt=ist;ord=123456789?)](http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/outside.adventure/nature;page=unschooling-the-case-for-setting-your-kids-into-the-wild;tile=1;pos=1;sz=300x250;sec=;dcopt=ist;ord=123456789?)

School is back in session and has been for two weeks or more, but the
boys are unhurried. They dress slowly, quietly. Faded and frayed
thrift-store camo pants. Flannel shirts. Rubber barn boots. Around their
waists, leather belts with knife sheaths. In each sheath, a fixed-blade
knife.

By 6:30, with the first rays of sun burning through the ground-level
fog, the boys are outside. At some point in the next hour, a yellow
school bus will rumble past the end of the driveway that connects the
farm to the town road. The bus will be full of children the boys’ age,
their foreheads pressed against the glass, gazing at the unfurling
landscape, the fields and hills and forests of the small working-class
community they call home.

The boys will pay the bus no heed. This could be because they will be
seated at the kitchen table, eating breakfast with their parents. Or it
might be because they are already deep in the woods below the house,
where a prolific brook trout stream sluices through a stand of balsam
fir; there is an old stone bridge abutment at the stream’s edge, and the
boys enjoy standing atop it, dangling fresh-dug worms into the water.
Perhaps they won’t notice the bus because they are already immersed in
some other project: tillering a longbow of black locust, or starting a
fire over which to cook the quartet of brookies they’ve caught. They
heat a flat rock at the fire’s edge, and the hot stone turns the fishes’
flesh milky white and flaky.

Or maybe the boys will pay the bus no heed because its passing is
meaningless to them. Maybe they have never ridden in a school bus, and
maybe this is because they’ve never been to school. Perhaps they have
not passed even a single day of their short childhoods inside the four
walls of a classroom, their gazes shifting between window and clock,
window and clock, counting the restless hours and interminable minutes
until release.

Maybe the boys are actually my sons, and maybe their names are Fin and
Rye, and maybe, if my wife, Penny, and I get our way, they will never go
to school.

Hey, a father can dream, can’t he?

* * * * *

There’s a name for the kind of education Fin and Rye are getting. It’s
called unschooling, though Penny and I have never been fond of the term.
But “self-directed, adult-facilitated life learning in the context of
their own unique interests” doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, so
unschooling it is.

It is already obvious that unschooling is radically different from
institutionalized classroom learning, but how does it differ from more
common homeschooling? Perhaps the best way to explain it is that all
unschooling is homeschooling, but not all homeschooling is unschooling.
While most homeschooled children follow a structured curriculum,
unschoolers like Fin and Rye have almost total autonomy over their days.
At ages that would likely see them in seventh and fourth grades, I
generously estimate that my boys spend no more than two hours per month
sitting and studying the subjects, such as science and math, that are
universal to mainstream education. Not two hours per day or even per
week. Two hours per *month*. Comparatively speaking, by now Fin would
have spent approximately 5,600 hours in the classroom. Rye, nearly three
years younger, would have clocked about half that time.

If this sounds radical, it’s only because you’re not taking a long
enough view, for the notion that children should spend the majority of
their waking hours confined to a classroom enjoys scant historical
precedent.

The first incidence of compulsory schooling came in 1852, when
Massachusetts required communities to offer free public education and
demanded that every child between the ages of 8 and 14 attend school for
at least 12 weeks per year. Over the next seven decades, the remaining
states adopted similar laws, and by 1918, the transition to mandated
public education was complete.

It was not long before some parents and even educators began to question
the value of compulsory education. One of those was [John
Holt](http://www.naturalchild.org/guest/marlene_bumgarner.html), a Yale
graduate and teacher at the Colorado Rocky Mountain School who published
his observations in *[How Children
Fail](http://www.amazon.com/Children-Fail-Classics-Child-Development/dp/0201484021)*
in 1964. Ultimately selling more than a million copies, it was an
indictment of the education system, asserting that children are born
with deep curiosity and love of learning, both of which are diminished
in school.

Holt became a passionate advocate for homeschooling, which existed in a
legal gray area, but he quickly realized that some parents were simply
replicating the classroom. So in 1977, in his magazine, *[Growing
Without
Schooling](http://issuu.com/patfarenga/stacks/bb179dac91264c10bb183f89bf955935)*,
he coined a new term: “GWS will say ‘unschooling’ when we mean taking
children out of school, and ‘deschooling’ when we mean changing the laws
to make schools noncompulsory and to take away from them their power to
grade, rank, and label people, i.e. to make lasting, official, public
judgments about them.”

Holt died in 1985, having authored 11 books on child development. But
along with veteran teacher John Taylor Gatto, author of *[Dumbing Us
Down: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory
Schooling](http://www.amazon.com/Dumbing-Down-Curriculum-Compulsory-Anniversary/dp/0865714487)*,
he popularized a movement. Well, maybe popularized is a tad generous;
while it’s generally accepted that unschoolers comprise about 10 percent
of the 1.8 million American children who learn at home, hard numbers are
scarce.

In addition to fundamental curricular differences, there is also
something of a cultural schism between the two styles. Home-schooling is
popularly associated with strong religious views (in a [2007 survey by
the National Center for Education
Statistics](http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2009/2009030.pdf), 83 percent of
homeschooling parents said that providing “religious or moral
instruction” was part of their choice), while unschooling seems to have
no such association. “Unschooling has always been sort of code for being
secular,” explains Patrick Farenga, who runs the unschooling website
[JohnHoltGWS.com](http://www.johnholtgws.com/). “It’s about
understanding that learning is not a special skill that happens separate
from everything else and only under a specialist’s gaze. It’s about
raising children who are curious and engaged in the world alongside
their families and communities.”

I can almost hear you thinking, Sure, but you live in the sticks, and
you both work at home. What about the rest of us? And it’s true: Penny
and I have made what most would consider an extreme choice. I write from
home, and we both run our farm, selling produce and meat to help pay the
bills. Everyone we know who unschools, in fact, has chosen autonomy over
affluence. Hell, some years we’re barely above the poverty line. But the
truth is, unschooling isn’t merely an educational choice. It’s a
lifestyle choice.

And it can happen anywhere; these concepts are not the sole domain of
rural Vermont hill farmers living out their Jeffersonian fantasies.
Kerry McDonald left a career in corporate training to unschool two of
her four children in Boston, though her husband, Brian, still works as a
technology consultant. “The city is our curriculum,” says McDonald. “We
believe that kids learn by living in the world around them, so we
immerse them in that world.” Their “classrooms”—sidewalks, museums, city
parks—may appear drastically different from those of my sons. But the
ethos remains the same, that a child’s learning is as natural and easy
as breathing.

Unschooling is also perfectly legal in all 50 states, so long as certain
basic stipulations—from simple notification to professional evaluations,
“curriculum” approval, and even home visits—are met. But many
unschoolers have been reticent to stand up and be counted, perhaps
because the movement tends to attract an independent-thinking,
antiauthoritarian personality type.

To the extent that I hadn’t demonstrated these qualities previously, the
arrival of my 16th birthday provided ample opportunity, rooted in two
events of great and lasting importance. The first, of course, was the
acquisition of my driver’s license. This came with a craptastic
Volkswagen Rabbit that my mother had driven for the past half-dozen
years and sold to me for $200.

The second was the quiet arrival of Vermont’s minimum dropout age. More
than three million American teens leave school annually, a number that
makes up about 8 percent of the nation’s 16-to-24-year-olds. Dropouts
comprise 75 percent of state inmates and 59 percent of those in federal
prison. They earn, on average, $260,000 less than graduates over their
lifetimes.

[![image](http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/outside.adventure/nature;page=unschooling-the-case-for-setting-your-kids-into-the-wild;tile=2;pos=2;sz=300x250;sec=;ord=123456789?)](http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/outside.adventure/nature;page=unschooling-the-case-for-setting-your-kids-into-the-wild;tile=2;pos=2;sz=300x250;sec=;ord=123456789?)

My 16th birthday came on November 23, 1987; by the end of that day, my
freshly minted driver’s license was cooling in my wallet. And by the
midpoint of my junior year, I had pointed that little Rabbit, already
bearing the scratch-and-dent evidence of my negligence, out of my high
school’s parking lot for the last time.

The irony of my dropping out can hardly be overstated. At the time, my
father—who earned his undergraduate degree at Cornell and his master’s
at Johns Hopkins—was employed by none other than Vermont’s Department of
Education. My mother graduated from Iowa’s Grinnell College and was a
substitute teacher. My family’s immersion in structured education was
total. It wasn’t merely the medium through which my parents made their
way in the world: it provided the means to support their children, one
of whom was now flipping the proverbial bird to the very hand that fed.

It might lend a degree of credibility to my role as my children’s
primary educator if I could report that I dropped out of high school for
reasons of virtue, perhaps to pursue a rigorous course of self-directed
study in thermonuclear engineering or to dig wells in some impoverished
sub-Saharan village. But the truth is, I left public school because I
was bored to the point of anger. To the point of numbness. To the point
of rebellion.

out there," Hewitt writes on his blog. *Photo*: Penny Hewitt

Day after day I sat, compelled to repeat and recite, and little of it
seemed to have any bearing beyond the vacuum of the classroom.
Everything I learned felt abstract and standardized. It was a
conditional knowledge that existed in separation from the richly
textured world just beyond the school’s plate-glass windows, which, for
all their transparency, felt like the bars of a prison cell.

Peter Gray knows just how I felt. Gray, a Boston College psychology
professor who wrote the 2013 book *[Free to Learn: Why Unleashing the
Instinct to Play Will Make Our Children Happier, More Self-Reliant, and
Better Students for
Life](http://www.amazon.com/Free-Learn-Unleashing-Instinct-Self-Reliant/dp/0465025994)*,
is unsparing in his criticism of compulsory education. “Children are
forced to attend school, where they are stripped of most of their
rights,” he says. “The debate shouldn’t be about whether school is
prison, because unless you want to change the definition of prison, it
is. School deliberately removes the environmental conditions that foster
self-directed learning and natural curiosity. It’s like locking a child
in a closet.”

What kids need instead, Gray contends, is exploration and play without
supervision. It is this that allows them to develop self-determination
and confidence. If he’s right, current educational trends are not
promising: in 2012, five states voted to increase the length of the
school year by no less than 300 hours.

Of course, unschooling is not the only choice. Increasingly, families
are turning to options like [Waldorf](http://www.whywaldorfworks.org/),
the largest so-called alternative-education movement in the world. It
was founded in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1919, based on the teachings of
Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner, who believed that children learn
best through creative play. In 1965, there were nine Waldorf schools in
the U.S.; today there are 123.

Sending our children to a Waldorf school was never an option for us, if
for no other reason than tuition, which can run as high as $30,000 a
year. But when Fin turned five, the age at which we deemed it necessary
to introduce some structure to his days, Penny and I sought to integrate
aspects of the Waldorf curriculum into his learning. We purchased reams
of thick craft paper, along with pastel crayons and watercolor paints.
Penny arranged a small “schooling” station at our kitchen table, under
the assumption that our firstborn would sit contentedly, expressing his
innate creativity even as he learned the rote information necessary to
navigate the modern world.

farm for over two decades. *Photo*: Penny Hewitt;

It was, to put it mildly, a flawed assumption. Fin chafed at every
second of his perceived captivity. Crayons were broken and launched at
innocent walls. Pages of extremely expensive paper were torn to flaky
bits. Bitter tears were shed, even a few by our son. It was an
unmitigated disaster.

It was also a watershed moment for our family. Because as soon as we
liberated ourselves from a concept of what our son’s education should
look like, we were able to observe how he learned best. And what we saw
was that the moment we stopped compelling Fin to sit and draw or paint
or write was the moment he began doing these things on his own. It was
the moment he began carving staves of wood into beautiful bows and
constructing complex toys from materials on hand: an excavator that not
only rotated, but also featured an extendable boom; a popgun fashioned
from copper pipe, shaved corks, and a whittled-down dowel; even a
sawmill with a rotating wooden “blade.”

In other words, the moment we quit trying to teach our son anything was
the moment he started really learning.

* * * * *

In my early twenties, having passed my General Educational Development
test and endured two semesters in Vermont’s state college system, I
lived for a time in a $75-per-month bungalow just outside the bucolic
Vermont village of Warren. This was at the apex of my immersion into
bicycle racing and backcountry skiing, and I worked infrequently in a
bike and ski shop, subsisting on the time-honored action-sports diet of
boxed noodles, canned tuna, and expired Clif Bars liberated from the
shop’s dumpster.

The bungalow was attached to a rambling, ranchlike structure that looked
out over the valley; it was one of those seventies-era, quasi-communal
homesteads that carried the lingering scent of sandalwood incense and
the fetid body odor unique to heavy tofu consumption. A sign by the door
read Resurrection City. Resurrection from what? I had no idea, and no
one seemed to know.

During my yearlong tenure at Camp RC, as it was affectionately known,
the main house was occupied by a single thirtysomething fellow named
Donald who homeschooled his two young sons, Crescent and Orion. Or maybe
he unschooled them. I do have a vague recollection of them sitting at a
table, studying… well, something. But, for the most part, the boys ran
wild, exploring the surrounding woods. On weekends, Donald packed up his
orange VW van and drove with Crescent and Orion to bike races and music
festivals, where they hawked vegetarian burritos. By the ages of six and
eight, the boys were prepping orders and making change.

I was blown away. And jealous. This was the childhood I wished I’d had,
equal measures freedom, responsibility, and respect, with none of the
rote soul-crushing memorization that had soured me on school. Sure,
Crescent and Orion could be a bit wild—I once found the front bumper of
my truck kissing a spruce tree that stood between the driveway and the
house—but they were precocious and self-aware, brimming with confidence
and curiosity. They looked you in the eye and spoke in full sentences.
They were constantly running and laughing and playing. I’m not sure how
else to put it except to say that never before had I known kids who so
fully embodied childhood.

When Penny, then my girlfriend, came to visit, she noticed it, too.
“Those kids are amazing,” she said. “I didn’t even know there were kids
like that.”

Fin and Rye almost always wake up before dawn. We do not have an alarm
clock, but early rising is our habit, ingrained over the decade and a
half we’ve run our small farm. We tend to chores as a family: Penny
heads to the barn to milk cows, I move the rest of the herd to fresh
pasture and slop the pigs, and the boys feed and water their dwarf
goats, Flora, Lupine, and Midnight.

By seven the chores are finished and we convene at the wide wooden table
for breakfast—eggs, usually, and bacon from last year’s pigs. After
breakfast, I repair to my desk to write and Penny heads to the fields or
orchard. Fin and Rye generally follow their mother before disappearing
into the woods. Sometimes they grab fishing poles, uncover a few worms,
and head to the stream, returning with their pockets full of fish,
fiddlehead ferns, and morel mushrooms. Occasionally I join them, and
these journeys are always marked by frequent stops, with one boy or the
other dropping to his knees to examine some small finding, something I
would have blithely, blindly stumbled over.

“Papa, look, wild onions.” And they’ll dig with their young fingers,
loosing the little bulbs from the soft forest soil. Later, we’ll fry
them in butter and eat them straight from the pan, still hot enough that
we hold them on the tips of our tongues before swallowing.

Other times, they work on one of the shelters that they always seem to
be constructing; their voices carry across the land as they negotiate
materials and design.

“Fin, let’s put the door on this side.”

“Did you say ten and three-eighths or ten and five-eighths?”

“Rye, we need another pole on this end.”

These shelters are so prolific that occasionally I come across one I
hadn’t even known existed, and I can see the evolution of the boys’
learning in the growing soundness of these humble structures. Winter’s
first big snowfall no longer spells collapse; the boys have learned to
slope the roof and to support the ridgepole at its center. They face the
openings southward and build on a piece of well-drained ground. They use
rot-resistant cedar for anything that will contact the soil.

Fin and Rye are proficient with most of the hand and power tools that
form the backbone of any working farm. By the time they were eight, both
of them could operate the tractor and, in a pinch, drive the truck with
a load of logs. They split firewood alongside us, swinging their mauls
with remarkable accuracy. They are both licensed hunters and own .22
rifles and 20-gauge shotguns. They wear belt knives almost everywhere,
oblivious to the stares of the adults around them, some concerned, some
perplexed, and some, it often seems to me, nostalgic.

Our sons are not entirely self-taught; we understand the limits of the
young mind and its still-developing capacity for judgment. None of these
responsibilities were granted at an arbitrary, age-based marker, but
rather as the natural outgrowth of their evolving skills and maturity.
We have noticed, however, that the more responsibility we give our sons,
the more they assume. The more we trust them, the more trustworthy they
become. This may sound patronizingly obvious, yet I cannot help but
notice the starring role that institutionalized education—with its
inherent risk aversion—plays in expunging these qualities.

Our days do have structure: chores morning and evening, gardens to be
turned and planted, berries to be picked and sold, all these things and
so many more repeating in overlapping cycles. But even within these
routines, Fin and Rye determine how their days will be spent. Often they
disappear for hours at a time, their only deadline being whichever meal
comes next. On their backs, they wear wooden pack baskets that they wove
under the tutelage of a friend who also unschools her children. When
they return, the baskets are heavy with the small treasures of their
world and their heads are full of the small stories of their wandering:
the moose tracks they saw, the grouse they flushed, the forked maple
they sat beneath to eat snacks. “The bark felt thick,” Fin tells me.
“It’s going to be a hard winter.”

Which brings us to the inevitable issue of what will become of my boys.
Of course, I cannot answer in full, because their childhoods are still
unfolding.

But not infrequently I field questions from parents who seem skeptical
that my sons will be exposed to particular fields of study or potential
career paths. The assumption seems to be that by educating our children
at home and letting them pursue their own interests, we are limiting
their choices and perhaps even depriving them. The only honest answer
is, Of course we are. But then, that’s true of every choice a parent
makes: no matter what we choose for our children, we are by default not
choosing something else.

I can report that Fin and Rye both learned to read and write with
essentially zero instruction, albeit when they were about eight years
old, a year or so later than is expected. They can add and subtract and
multiply and divide. I can report that they do indeed have friends, some
who attend school and some who don’t, and their social skills are on par
with their peers. In fact, Penny and I often hear from other adults that
our sons seem better socialized than like-aged schoolchildren. Fin and
Rye participate in a weekly gathering of homeschooled and unschooled
kids, and Fin attends a weekly wilderness-skills program. In truth, few
of their peers are as smitten with bushcraft as they are, and sometimes
they wish for more friends who share their love of the wild. But even
this is OK; the world is a place of wondrous diversity, and they must
learn that theirs is not the only way.

What if they want to be doctors? They will be doctors. What if they want
to be lawyers? They will be lawyers. Peter Gray, he of the  belief that
school is prison, has studied graduates of the Sudbury Valley School in
Framingham, Massachusetts, where “students” as young as four enjoy
complete autonomy to design their own course of study, even if that
involves no studying at all, and found that they have no difficult
gaining entry to elite colleges, nor in achieving high GPAs. A
home-based education, even one as unstructured as my sons’, does not
preclude acceptance into a university; in fact, many colleges have
developed application processes geared specifically toward homeschooled
students, and while there are no major studies of unschoolers
exclusively, homeschoolers are significantly more likely to take
college-level courses than the rest of us.

“I look back at unschooling as the best part of my life,” Chelsea Clark
told me between classes at the University of South Carolina School of
Law, where she was accepted on full scholarship after graduating Phi
Beta Kappa from the university’s undergraduate program. “It was a huge
advantage, actually. I had the confidence of knowing what I wanted to
do, and I wasn’t burned out on classroom learning like most college
kids.” Chelsea was unschooled throughout her high school years in the
small town of Dorchester, South Carolina.

Still, perhaps the best answer I can give to the question of what price
my children might pay is in the form of another question: What price do
school-going children pay for their confinement? The physical toll is
easy enough to quantify. [Diabetes rates among school-age
children](http://ndep.nih.gov/media/youth_factsheet.pdf) are sky-high,
and the percentage of 6-to-11-year-olds who qualify as obese [has nearly
tripled](http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/obesity/facts.htm) since 1980.
And what do children do in school? Exactly. They sit.

Inactivity is also bad for the brain. A [2011
study](http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/education/2011-02-09/study-finds-exercising-feeds-brain?v=1297301290)
by Georgia Health Sciences University found that cognitive function
among kids improves with exercise. Their prefrontal cortex—the area
associated with complex thinking, decision making, and social
behavior—lights up. The kids in the study who exercised 40 minutes per
day boosted their intelligence scores by an average of 3.8 points.

Yet the physical and cognitive implications of classroom learning have
played minor roles in our decision to unschool Fin and Rye. It’s not
that I don’t want them to be healthy and smart. Of course I do—I’m their
father.

But, in truth, what I most want for my boys can’t be charted or graphed.
It can’t be measured, at least not by common metrics. There is no
standardized test that will tell me if it has been achieved, and there
is no specific curriculum that will lead to its realization.

This is what I want for my sons: freedom. Not just physical freedom, but
intellectual and emotional freedom from the formulaic learning that
prevails in our schools. I want for them the freedom to immerse
themselves in the fields and forest that surround our home, to wander
aimlessly or with purpose. I want for them the freedom to develop at
whatever pace is etched into their DNA, not the pace dictated by an
institution looking to meet the benchmarks that will in part determine
its funding. I want them to be free to love learning for its own sake,
the way that all children love learning for its own sake when it is not
forced on them or attached to reward. I want them to remain free of
social pressures to look, act, or think any way but that which feels
most natural to them.

I want for them the freedom to be children. And no one can teach them
how to do that.
