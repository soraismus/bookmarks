Ruby is an interesting language, in that it supports the use of multiple
paradigms. One of these is the “functional paradigm”.

Features of Functional Languages
--------------------------------

Using a language in a functional style implies you have access to a few
key features:

-   **Immutable values**: once a “variable” is set, it cannot be
    changed. In Ruby, this means you effectively have to treat variables
    like constants.
-   **No side-effects**: when passed a given value, a function must
    always return the same result. This goes hand in hand with having
    immutable values; a function can never take a value and change it,
    as this would be causing a side-effect that is tangential to
    returning a result.
-   **Higher-order functions**: these are functions that allow functions
    as arguments, or use functions as the return value. This is,
    arguably, one of the most critical features of any functional
    language.
-   **Currying**: enabled by higher-order functions, currying is
    transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a
    function that takes one argument. This goes hand in hand with
    partial function application, which is transforming a multi-argument
    function into a function that takes less arguments then it did
    originally.
-   **Recursion**: looping by calling a function from within itself.
    When you don’t have access to mutable data, recursion is used to
    build up and chain data construction. This is because looping is not
    a functional concept, as it requires variables to be passed around
    to store the state of the loop at a given time.
-   **Lazy-evaluation, or delayed-evaluation**: delaying processing of
    values until the moment when it is actually needed. If, as an
    example, you have some code that generated list of Fibonacci numbers
    with lazy-evaluation enabled, this would not actually be processed
    and calculated until one of the values in the result was required by
    another function, such as `puts`.

Using Ruby as a Functional Language
-----------------------------------

In this series, we will visit each of these features one by one, and
look at how you can use them to produce cleaner, more efficient, and
better structured Ruby code.

I should point out in advance a warning: using some of the techniques we
will cover in production code is not recommended. I’ll try to clearly
state, whenever I can, which features these are and why they are bad.
The fact is, though, that Ruby is, at heart, an OO language for an OO
world. Functional style code can be written in Ruby easily, but it
suffers mostly from performance problems as a result of not being the
focused on the paradigm.

More on that later; for now, let’s talk about the topic at hand:
immutability.

Immutability, and Side-Effect Free Code
---------------------------------------

To start the series off, let’s explore immutability and side-effect free
code. Pure functional languages do not allow mutable data, and as a
result, functions cannot do anything but take arguments and produce a
result using these arguments.

What Is Side-Effect Free Code, and Why Is It Good For Me?
---------------------------------------------------------

Functional programming is a paradigm based mostly on the principles that
programming should follow the rules of mathematics. Let’s take the
following, valid imperative programming paradigm expression:

If we apply the rules of maths to this, we should be able to rebalance
the equation:

Woah, what happened there?! Clearly, this doesn’t work. The imperative
style of programming doesn’t match the mathethematical underpinning of
functional programming. Mathematical functions are built on the idea of
immutability; that is, values cannot be redefined like we have done in
the imperative statement above. We can combat this problem by using a
new constant to represent the updated value:

Now this is perfectly valid in both paradigms:

The functional programming paradigm, with its roots based in
mathematics, uses this basic idea at its core. When using Ruby for
functional programming techniques, and you want to try to avoid
side-effects, you should endeavour to never redefine a variable; that
is, treat variables as constants. There are numerous benefits to this
approach, some important ones of which are:

-   Functions, or methods, become easily unit tested. This is because,
    if they never mutate data, but rather only ever provide copies or
    new objects as return values, the same input is guaranteed to always
    produce the same output. Thus, the code can be said to be
    “side-effect free”.
-   Your code becomes incredibly concise and readable. As you will have
    to create a new variable for every mutation you need to do, it will
    be obvious at first glance as to the scalability and shortfalls of a
    particular method. Pure functional languages often tout the easy
    ability to reason about performance of a given block of code as a
    feature.
-   Chaining becomes incredibly easy, mainly because what is returned by
    every function is a new, immutable value that can be passed into the
    next without worry, and discarded without concern.
-   Your functions will be domain free; you can apply them in an
    infinite number of ways, as they have no state specific logic hidden
    inside of them.

Writing Side-Effect Free Code
-----------------------------

### Version Number Parsing

In 2010, Yahuda Katz posted a simple, but interesting question on
Twitter^1^ :

> Question: what’s the easiest way to get ["X::Y::Z", "X::Y", "X"] from
> “X::Y::Z” in Ruby?

Of course, there are dozens of solutions to this problem, but solving it
in a functional style proved to be a lure too good to resist for the
Ruby Quicktips Tumblr ^2^:

There are many benefits to writing this method in a functional style
with zero side-effects:

-   Easily testable with unit tests.
-   Uses as many core Ruby methods as possible, decreasing the
    likelihood of error creep and wheel re-invention.
-   Pretty fast. Uses memoization where possible, and optimised Ruby
    core methods elsewhere.
-   Clean, readable, easily understood; it virtually reads like plain
    English.

### Fluent DSLs With Chainable Methods

One major benefit of using a functional style is that it generally makes
chaining a piece of cake. In this example, we’re going to try and build
a DSL for building up a block of CSS code; we’ll build up a selector,
along with properties and values to set styles on.

As such, we need a class, with two methods: one for adding properties,
and one for setting the selector.

First, we’ll set the selector as a mandatory property in the
initialiser. We’ll also set up the properties attribute as an empty
`Hash`:

Note that we’ve used an `attr_reader` for both properties, and we’ve
duplicated and frozen the values; now we can guarantee the passed in
values cannot be modified.

Next, we create the code to add some properties to the block:

The key takeaways from this block of code are:

-   We accept either a `Hash` of properties to merge in, or a key/value
    pair to add to the already existing properties.
-   We return a new instance of the `CssBlock` class, setting the
    properties to be the merge result of the existing properties and our
    new properties.
-   We raise an error if they didn’t give us the right format of items.
-   We do not add, edit or modify any state stored on the copy of the
    object we’re dealing with. Once the object is instantated, that’s
    it; it’s fixed as it was.

Now, let’s add a method to serialise the contents of this class, which
is basically us just defining the `#to_s` method:

We use `#inject` to build up an array of stringified properties. One
absolutely crucial little detail here is that we do not modify the `acc`
variable within the block. As Ruby’s equivalent of the `fold/foldr`
function found in most functional programming languages, `#inject` is a
staple method for building up objects in a functional way as shown.

Now to test it out:

Huzzah, it works! Not only that, but it’s super simple, easily testable,
and should prove to be very easy to work with or extend as necessary.

For your convenience, here’s the full source code:

Caveats of Side-Effect Free Code In Ruby
----------------------------------------

The reality of trying to write side-effect free code in Ruby is that it
doesn’t really work for much else but experimentation at this stage. The
raw truth of the matter is that Ruby has several major problems handling
properly immutable data:

-   Freezing objects cannot be automated. You can get part way by monkey
    patching the `#new_method` on Class to call freeze on the return
    value of the original `#new method`, but that method doesn’t get
    called when certain core types are instantiated (Hash, String,
    Array, etc.). That means you’ll have to manually freeze objects if
    you want them to be forced immutable; if you don’t, you can’t
    guarantee you’re actually writing side-effect free code.
-   The steep cost of object creation in Ruby means that using a
    functional style of programming is going to prove costly to any
    performance related goals. Hopefully, this problem will fade away as
    Ruby implementations push for faster interpreters.
-   One of the key benefits of functional programming, simpler
    concurrency, is difficult to achieve in Ruby due to the presence of
    the GIL and a naïve threading implementation. In alternative Ruby
    implementations such as JRuby and Rubinius, this is not such a big
    problem. Although Ruby 1.9 has made big strides towards a better
    threading model with Fibers and such, it will still make fully
    exploring this realm of benefits harder than it is in a purpose
    built functional language as there is still no way to have proper
    parallel threads in CRuby.

Whilst these techniques are not necessarily useful in production code,
they are extremely useful to keep in mind when designing robust object
models.

Next Time…
----------

We’ll talk about higher-order functions, and how they allow currying, a
very interesting and highly useful programming approach.

    What about using symbols instead of variables. From what I gather
    they are immutable.

    I find this article very useful and will refer to it often. Thank
    you for taking this time to write it!

    I must politely disagree with what Brian says though as I have been
    searching for something like you wrote and never came across
    anything similar before (and his links aren’t the same!!)
