Last week at the MIT January term course *Hacking a Technical
Interview*, after a class period finished a student asked me the
question:

> **I know many different programming languages. How do I choose which
> one to use during my interview?**

Why choose just one?
====================

Don’t get me wrong—I advocate learning and writing code in many
programming languages. But when it comes time for programming interview
preparation, I feel it’s important to **choose one language** to focus
your prep on and get to know it very well.

While many interviewers don’t mind you writing pseudocode during the
early planning step of answering a question, others I’ve come across
*really*want you to show you can write compilable code without an IDE.
Not only that, but that you appear very comfortable writing real code.

How to pick
===========

Now back to our polyglot student—how might they approach choosing just
one?

Choose a language you know well
-------------------------------

If you’re fresh out of school and throughout your college career you
were instructed in Java, C or C++, stick with what you know.

Imagine this: what if I asked you right now, at your computer, to
please, using a programming language (not your bash-fu or vimscript):

1.  **Read in a file** full of numbers, one number on each line
2.  Represent those numbers **as integers** in your program
3.  Replace each number with that number **times its line number**
4.  **Write the file** out elsewhere
5.  And complete the task right now at your computer **as fast as
    possible**, you’re being timed

Think—**what language would you immediately reach for**? Do you start
your experimentation with ipython, or irb? Do you pop open Eclipse and
write some Java? Or create a new .cpp file?

### Make sure it’s widely readable

*Ideally* you’re most comfortable with a language that your interviewer
has used before, but at the very least it should be **readable by a wide
audience**.

Some solid, standard choices for interviewing, then, are: **Java, C /
C++ / C\#, Python, Javascript**, and maybe **Ruby**. PHP, AS3, Lua,
Haskell, Go, LISP/Scheme and the ilk are potentially appropriate *when
the company uses them*.

Consider this great visualization of the most popular coding languages
of 2013 from the interactive practice problem website CodeEval:

[![Most popular programming languages of

Most popular programming languages of 2014

If you’re using a non-standard feature of your language that might not
show up in others (dense **Python list comprehensions**, **Ruby
functional programming** techniques, higher-order functions)—it’s a good
idea to be cognizant of the interviewer’s comfort with the language and
gently **offer explanations** of concepts they might not have exposure
to yet.

### Bias towards the one they use

Some advice from the book [Programming Interviews
Exposed](http://amzn.com/047012167X?tag=a200-20)—all things equal,
**bias slightly towards the language your target companies use** if it’s
one of the ones you’re most comfortable with.

For example, if the company you’re applying to is primarily a Ruby shop
and you’re fairly confident with your Ruby, go with that. If you’re
applying to a low-level hardware manufacturer working mostly in C and
Assembly, go with that. Game company that uses ActionScript, and you’re
writing a game in it now? Go with that.

Here are some oft-used languages at various companies as reported in
Cracking the Coding Interview and on
[Quora](http://www.quora.com/What-programming-languages-are-used-at-Amazon):

1.  Facebook: PHP, C++, Python, Java, Perl. High regard for
    dynamic/scripting languages.
    ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3690092/what-programming-language-does-facebook-use))
2.  Google: officially C/C++, Java, Python, Javascript, Go
    ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4773379/official-programming-languages-at-google))
3.  Amazon: Java, Javascript, Ruby, Python, Perl
    ([source](http://www.quora.com/What-programming-languages-are-used-at-Amazon))
4.  Microsoft: C++, C\#, Java, Python ([source
    1](http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Top-10-Microsoft-Programming-Languages-704642/),
    [2](http://www.quora.com/Microsoft/Does-Microsoft-use-Languages-like-Python-or-PHP-for-its-products))

Once you’ve picked your language
================================

Excellent, so you’ve chosen a language to focus your preparation on and
to use for your interviews. Now what do you do?

Practice in your language
-------------------------

When you are doing practice problems, try to always write with the
language you’ll be using in your interview.

The couple of weeks leading up to your interview, when you’re doing
personal projects and hacking on things for fun, try to use that
language as well.

Know thy common operations
--------------------------

Make sure you have at least the following operations down pat:

1.  Initializing and using hash-backed maps (**dictionaries**) and sets
2.  Performing **queue** and **stack** operations (whether using an
    array, like with Ruby’s pop/shift, or an explicit standard library
    implementation like Java’s Stack and [Linked List-backed
    Queue](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4626812/how-do-i-instantiate-a-queue-object-in-java)
    classes)
3.  **Defining classes** with **constructors** and **attributes**,
    **static** and **instance methods,** and defining a **subclass** and
    **interface**
4.  **Throwing exceptions** for (1) **invalid input** and (2) **custom
    messages**
5.  **Iterating** through **arrays and dictionaries** (both key and
    values)—including iterating while **maintaining an index** (Ruby’s
    each\_with\_index, [Python’s
    enumerate](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/522563/accessing-the-index-in-python-for-loops))
6.  **Casting** between strings and integers
7.  **Strings**: get character at index, get range, concatenate
8.  Initializing **2d arrays**
9.  Arithmetic: modulus (remainder), division (if the first operand is
    an integer, will it round the result to an integer?), **rounding**
    (ceiling and floor)
10. (*More advanced candidates*) The 5 standard **bit manipulation**
    operations (L/R shifts, not, or, and, xor)

Know the best practices
-----------------------

Especially if the company you’re applying to has experience with your
language, it can be helpful to brush up on the best practices for your
language. Sometimes you’ll get trivia questions, or be asked about some
language-specific patterns.

If you’re going with Java, for example, and applying to Amazon, where
Java is heavily used, consider reading through some of the best
practices material.

There are some great books like [Effective
Java](http://amzn.com/0321356683?tag=a200-20), [Secrets of the
Javascript Ninja](http://amzn.com/193398869X?tag=a200-20), [Effective
C++](http://amzn.com/0321334876?tag=a200-20), and [The Ruby Programming
Language](http://amzn.com/0596516177?tag=a200-20)[](http://amzn.com/0596516177?tag=a200-20)
which cover language-specific best coding practices.

Have some opinions about it
---------------------------

Some classic “technical chit-chat” interview questions are:

-   **What do you like** about language X?
-   What ***don’t*** you like about it?
-   **How does it compare** to (another language you profess to know)?
    Similarities/differences?

Formulating some smart opinions about your language is generally a good
idea.

Where does your language fall among the different [programming language
paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multi-paradigm_programming_languages#Language_overview)?
A book like [Seven Languages in Seven
Weeks](http://amzn.com/193435659X?tag=a200-20) is a good starting point
if your breadth of language paradigm understanding is lacking.

Now Prepare!
============

Now you’ve got your language and some steps to take to know it better
for your interviews. Go forth and prosper!

Of course, as noted earlier, it’s not necessary to always stick to one
language when not preparing for interviews—learning new languages is fun
and can lead you to understand your go-to language better. But the week
or few days before your interview, be sure to drill deep into one.

### What is Coding for Interviews?

Each week, Coding for Interviews members receive two things:

1.  **A programming interview question**
2.  **A distilled computer science topic review (with silly gifs)**

You send in your answer and the next week we review solutions.

We practice a little bit each week. The idea is, the next time our group
members are looking for jobs, we will be prepared.

New group members are always welcome!

**One email each week. No spam. Easy unsubscribe.**

        In all fairness, my example is a pretty bad one because it does
        beg for a dense functional programming paradigm
        language/solution which tends to be done less often in the
        interview context.

        But if you busted out an accurate BASH one-liner in an interview
        with me, that’d be a big plus.

    def exercise(infile, outfile):\
     open(outfile, “w”).write(‘n’.join(map(lambda x: str(x[0]\*x[1]),
    enumerate(map(int, open(infile).readlines()), 1))))

    That exercise would be a good fit for a functional language.

    come on, how could you use anything else than perl:

    perl -n -E’say $\_ \* $.’ nb.txt \> new\_nb.txt

    one-liner: check, use of funky special variables: check, code under
    10 characters (by removing the optional spaces around the \*):
    check, duck and wait for the “but it’s just line noise” crowd:
    check.
    ![;-)](http://blog.codingforinterviews.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)

    -   http://xmltwig.com mirod

        also: can be golfed further: check

        perl -p -l -E’$\_\*=$.’

-   Gabriele Carrettoni

    ` runResourceT $ CB.sourceFile "input" $= CT.decode CT.utf8 =$= CT.lines =$= CL.concatMapAccum (e i -> (succ i, [T.pack $ (show $ i * (read (T.unpack e) :: Int)) ++ "n"])) 1 $= CT.encode CT.utf8 $$ CB.sinkFile "output"`

    Haskell with Data.Conduit package, it is long, but this version
    doesn’t load all the file in memory but it’s “streamed” and it
    allows a lot of reusability because if the format of the file
    changes or anything else, you can swap one conduit for another and
    keep the rest of the pipeline the same.

    Without conduit you could write

    ` fmap (writeFile "output" . unlines . zipWith (i e -> show $ (read e :: Int) * i) [1..] . lines) $ readFile "input"`

    or\

    ` readFile "input" >>= return . lines >>= return . zipWith (i e -> show $ (read e :: Int) * i) [1..] >>= return . unlines  >>= writeFile "output"`

    or\

    ` main = do    ls  show $ (read e :: Int) * i) [1..] ls    writeFile "output" unls`

    Though Python is my go-to language (see what I did there?) of choice
    for more complex things, I like the simplicity and readability of
    awk for solving this particular problem: awk ‘{print $0 \* NR}’

    -   Gumnos

        Though I’d also want to know whether the line-numbers should be
        0-based or 1-based, and what should happen in the event a line’s
        contents don’t match the spec (multiple numbers on the same
        line, or non-integer lines)
