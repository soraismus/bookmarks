requestAnimationFrame for Smart Animating
=========================================

Feb 22nd, 2011

If you’ve never written code to animate inside the browser, you can stop
reading :)

#### What is requestAnimationFrame?

In your animation work, you’ve used a timer loop to make changes every
few milliseconds. Good for us: browser vendors have decided, “hey, why
don’t we just give you an API for that, because we can probably optimize
some things for you.” So it’s basic API for use with animation, whether
that be DOM-based styling changes, canvas or WebGL.

#### Why should I use it?

The browser can optimize concurrent animations together into a single
reflow and repaint cycle, leading to higher fidelity animation. For
example, JS-based animations synchronized with CSS transitions or SVG
SMIL. Plus, **if you’re running the animation loop in a tab that’s not
visible, the browser won’t keep it running**, which means less CPU, GPU,
and memory usage, leading to much longer battery life.

#### OMG I can brag about having a site with battery-friendly animations?

Yeah bro. Totes McGoats.

#### How should I use this?

    // shim layer with setTimeout fallback
    window.requestAnimFrame = (function(){
      return  window.requestAnimationFrame       ||
              window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame ||
              window.mozRequestAnimationFrame    ||
              function( callback ){
                window.setTimeout(callback, 1000 / 60);
              };
    })();


    // usage:
    // instead of setInterval(render, 16) ....

    (function animloop(){
      requestAnimFrame(animloop);
      render();
    })();
    // place the rAF *before* the render() to assure as close to
    // 60fps with the setTimeout fallback.

Note: I am using ‘request**Anim**Frame\` here because since ~~[the
spec](http://webstuff.nfshost.com/anim-timing/Overview.html) is still in
flux, I don’t want to make a straight
[polyfill](http://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill/), yet.~~

2012.01.07: The spec has gotten some fixes and settled down. We’re also
seeing ms and o implementations, so we’re ready for a polyfill now!

#### A robust polyfill

Opera engineer Erik Möller [wrote about rAF and developed a
polyfill](http://my.opera.com/emoller/blog/2011/12/20/requestanimationframe-for-smart-er-animating)
that better handles browsers without native support. You can read about
it, but basically his code will choose a delay of between 4ms and 16ms
in order to more closely match 60fps. Here it is, in case you’d like to
use it. Note it uses the standard method name. I have also fixed the
`cancel*` method’s name, as it has changed in WebKit.

    (function() {
        var lastTime = 0;
        var vendors = ['webkit', 'moz'];
        for(var x = 0; x < vendors.length && !window.requestAnimationFrame; ++x) {
            window.requestAnimationFrame = window[vendors[x]+'RequestAnimationFrame'];
            window.cancelAnimationFrame =
              window[vendors[x]+'CancelAnimationFrame'] || window[vendors[x]+'CancelRequestAnimationFrame'];
        }

        if (!window.requestAnimationFrame)
            window.requestAnimationFrame = function(callback, element) {
                var currTime = new Date().getTime();
                var timeToCall = Math.max(0, 16 - (currTime - lastTime));
                var id = window.setTimeout(function() { callback(currTime + timeToCall); },
                  timeToCall);
                lastTime = currTime + timeToCall;
                return id;
            };

        if (!window.cancelAnimationFrame)
            window.cancelAnimationFrame = function(id) {
                clearTimeout(id);
            };
    }());

I have this polyfill available [as a
gist](https://gist.github.com/1579671) as well.

#### Let’s see that in action

#### The requestAnimationFrame API

~~~~ {.line-numbers}

    window.requestAnimationFrame(function(/* time */ time){
      // time ~= +new Date // the unix time
    });

The callback is passed the current time as the first argument, as you’ll
likely want that.

~~You’ll also notice the second parameter to requestAnimFrame: the
element that visually bounds the entire animation. For canvas and WebGL,
this will be the actual `<canvas>` element. For DOM stuff, you can leave
it off or define it for a slightly more optimized experience.~~It’s
since been removed from the spec (and WebKit’s implementation)

#### Is it ready?

Right now, the Webkit implementation (available in [Nightly
Safari](http://nightly.webkit.org) and [Chrome Dev
Channel](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel)) and the
Mozilla one (available in FF4) differ slightly. Mozilla’s has a [bug
which ~~caps potential framerates at about
30fps~~](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=630127).Actually,
“It’s currently capped at 1000/(16 + N) fps, where N is the number of ms
it takes your callback to execute. If your callback takes 1000ms to
execute, then it’s capped at under 1fps. If your callback takes 1ms to
execute, you get about 60fps.” (thx, Boris) It’ll be fixed though,
probably for the next release after FF4 ships. Also Chrome 10 doesn’t
have the time parameter (added in m11), FF currently ignores the element
argument.

#### We want your feedback!

If you do animation work, WebKit and Gecko hackers would love to hear if
this meets your needs or if it could be improved any. Take a [look at
the draft requestAnimationFrame
spec](http://webstuff.nfshost.com/anim-timing/Overview.html). It’s
currently modeled like setTimeout; does a setInterval repeating style
API make more sense? Does this API have downsides when animating
multiple simultaneous elements? Does the element reference work for you?
In general, does this solve the common cases of animation?

Thx @mrdoob for bringing this up today and spreading the good word.

2011.06.01: Joe Lambert took this idea and provided shims for both
setTimeout and setInterval that leverage this.
[http://blog.joelambert.co.uk/2011/06/01/a-better-settimeoutsetinterval/](http://blog.joelambert.co.uk/2011/06/01/a-better-settimeoutsetinterval/)
\
 2011.10.13: Updated code sample and explained why the rAF call before
render makes sense due to the timeout fallback. \
 2011.12.14: Updated code sample and text. Removed references to element
argument, as it was removed from spec [and webkit’s
impl](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74232). \
 2012.01.01: Added polyfill from Erik Moller. \
 2012.01.05: Addressed polyfill fix from Tino Zijdel of DHTML Lemmings
fame. :) \
 2013.03.06: No more \`ms\` or \`o\` prefixes neccessary. Removed. \
 2014.01.23: Someone asked [if this polyfill is still
neccessary](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21300797/89484). It is. Red and
yellow-flagged entries still require the fallback and prefix
normalization, respectively:
