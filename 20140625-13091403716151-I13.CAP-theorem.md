CAP Theorem: Explained
======================

Written by [Robert Greiner](/about) on June 18, 2014

Several years ago, building performance into a software system was
simple - you either increased your hardware resources (scale up) or
modified your application to run more efficiently (performance tuning).
Today, there's a third option: horizontal scaling (scale out).

Horizontal scaling of software systems has become necessary in recent
years, due to the global nature of computing and the ever-increasing
performance demands on applications. In many cases, it is no longer
acceptable to run a single server with a single database in a single
data center adjacent to your company's headquarters. We need truly
distributed environments to tackle the business challenges of today.

Unfortunately, the performance benefits that horizontal scaling provides
come at a cost - complexity. Distributed systems introduce many more
factors into the performance equation than existed before. Data records
vary across clients/nodes in different locations. Single points of
failure destroy system up-time, and intermittent network issues creep up
at the worst possible time.

These concerns of *consistency* (C), *availability* (A), and *partition
tolerance* (P) across distributed systems make up what [Eric
Brewer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Brewer_(scientist)) coined as
the **CAP Theorem**. Simply put, the CAP theorem demonstrates that any
distributed system cannot guaranty C, A, and P simultaneously, rather,
trade-offs must be made at a point-in-time to achieve the level of
performance and availability required for a specific task.

[![CAP Theorem
Trade-offs](http://robertgreiner.com/uploads/images/2014/CAP.png "CAP Theorem Trade-offs")](http://robertgreiner.com/uploads/images/2014/CAP-full.png)

**[C] Consistency** - All nodes see the same data at the same time.

Simply put, performing a *read* operation will return the value of the
most recent *write* operation causing all nodes to return the same data.
A system has consistency if a transaction starts with the system in a
consistent state, and ends with the system in a consistent state. In
this model, a system can (and does) shift into an inconsistent state
during a transaction, but the entire transaction gets rolled back if
there is an error during any stage in the process.

Typical relational databases are consistent: SQL Server, MySQL, and
PostgreSQL.

**[A] Availability** - Every request gets a response on success/failure.

Achieving availability in a distributed system requires that the system
remains operational 100% of the time. Every client gets a response,
regardless of the state of any individual node in the system. This
metric is trivial to measure: either you can submit read/write commands,
or you cannot.

Typical relational databases are also available: SQL Server, MySQL, and
PostgreSQL. This means that relational databases exist in the **CA**
space - consistency and availability. However, CA is not only reserved
for relational databases - some document-oriented tools like
ElasticSearch also fall under the CA umbrella.

**[P] Partition Tolerance** - System continues to work despite message
loss or partial failure.

Most people think of their data store as a single node in the network.
*"This is our production SQL Server instance"*. Anyone who has run a
production instance for more than four minutes, quickly realizes that
this creates a *single point of failure*. A system that is
partition-tolerant can sustain any amount of network failure that
doesn't result in a failure of the entire network. Data records are
sufficiently replicated across combinations of nodes and networks to
keep the system up through intermittent outages.

Storage systems that fall under Partition Tolerance with Consistency
(CP): MongoDB, Redis, AppFabric Caching, and MemcacheDB. CP systems make
for excellent distributed caches since every client gets the same data,
and the system is partitioned across network boundaries.

Storage systems that fall under Partition Tolerance with Availability
(AP) include DynamoDB, CouchDB, and Cassandra.

**Conclusion**

Distributed systems allow us to achieve a level of computing power and
availability that were simply not available in yesteryears. Our systems
have higher performance, lower latency, and near 100% up-time in data
centers that span the entire globe. Best of all, the systems of today
are run on commodity hardware that is easily obtainable and configurable
with costs approaching $0.

All of this computing power and benefit comes at a price, however.
Distributed systems are more complex than their single-network
counterparts. There are many more tools and skills that need to be
acquired in order to create a truly scalable, high performance system.
Understanding the complexity incurred in distributed systems, making the
appropriate trade-offs for the task at hand (CAP), and selecting the
right tool for the job are all critical skills in a world where
computing systems are moving out, not up.
