\*poof\* … and then Rails was gone
==================================

[8
Replies](http://patmaddox.com/2014/05/15/poof-and-then-rails-was-gone/#comments "Comment on *poof* … and then Rails was gone")

[DHH posted some code](https://gist.github.com/dhh/4849a20d2ba89b34b201)
extracted from [Jim Weirich’s talk on Hexagonal Architecture in
Rails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg5RFeSfBM4), and invited people
to present alternative solutions. Here’s one of mine.

A hexagonal application
-----------------------

DHH’s first example satisfies the intent and properties of the
[hexagonal
architecture](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture). It
allows the application to equally be driven by multiple clients and to
be developed and tested in isolation from its eventual deployment
environments. It defines ports for interacting with the application and
requires adapters to use the ports.

Look at his example controlller:

I don’t see any dependencies on Rails, do you? I see a dozen lines of
code that follow the conventions used in many Rails applications, but I
do not see Railties, ActiveRecord, ActionController, ActionPack,
ActiveSupport, or any of the libraries core to the Ruby on Rails
framework. I see an application that saves employee records. It
abstracts the details of how it saves those records, and how it gets its
input.

Spotting the Ports
------------------

Looking at this bit of code through the lens of ports and adapters, I
see a couple ports. The first port saves the employee record. The second
port accepts input from a user and communicates results back to the
user.

The ports are still a bit abstract at this point, so I’ll define
protocols for the adapters to follow:

These specs make it easy for me to write new adapters to work with this
application. If I can implement objects that satisfy this protocol, I
can extend the capabilities of the application without modifying its
core logic, and I can change the core logic independent of the
technologies that support the application.

When I write the specs out like that, I’m amused by what seems to be a
good bit of work to support 10 lines of code. At first I thought this
might be too trivial of an example, but I’ve identified two protocols
that together define six methods.

Adapters bring new capabilities
-------------------------------

I’ll start off with a persistence adapter. The first one can work in
memory to get me going.

Next I’ll make a view adapter to accept input and provide feedback.

Now I need to connect the adapters to the application. I can do this
without changing any application code.

By ordering everything right, I can paste it all into irb to run the
app.

Modular design
--------------

In 30 lines of code I’ve built entirely new adapters to DHH’s
application. I didn’t abstract Rails away – DHH’s design decisions meant
that Rails was never there to begin with.

It’s not just a lovely bit of Ruby trickery
![;)](http://patmaddox.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)
This is what happens when you work towards a hexagonal architecture –
you design applications that speak well-defined protocols and depend on
abstractions. The architecture doesn’t make this happen automatically.
You have to think about the architecture and make design decisions to
support it.

Keepin it Hexy
--------------

In terms of hexagonal architecture, the original Rails controller and
action fulfill the properties of making application logic available via
protocols, and keeping the application logic independent of persistence
and UI implementation details.

I hadn’t considered that the view might be the primary adapter and so it
makes sense to inherit from it. I think refactoring to make the
dependencies explicit will lead to a more natural design.

Inverting the dependencies let me move the application code right to the
top. It now purely expresses the application code without any hidden
dependencies. You can use the protocol specs to define new adapters
easily.

Wrap up
-------

Ultimately, the hexagonal architecture style attempts to guide you
toward a modular design style. A modular design style enables powerful
software systems that are easy to reason about and change. DHH may have
tried “to illustrate the design damage that’s being induced by following
this pattern”, but I’d say his example shows how easy it is to apply the
hexagonal architecture in Ruby. Hexagonal architecture doesn’t replace
your design sensibilities, it augments them by providing a set of
factors to consider when designing software.

    You are impementing (not only) a storage in oder to test the
    behavior of the controller in isolation, without the real db… Right?
    The Implementation is very simple in this case. But when its the
    time to switch to a real db in your tests? Never? Doesnt it mean you
    have to reimplement lots of the db features in such cases? I guess
    not. But my imagination is not enough to imagine how would you test
    it in isolation when more complex db features are involved.

        > But when its the time to switch to a real db in your tests?
        > Never?

        I’ll reply with a personal opinion of a not that experienced
        developer.

        Ideally, yes. You shouldn’t test a real DB, you should test a
        correct use of an interface. Test that you get correct SQL, test
        that you make correct decisions and that your code is
        implemented correctly. Let ORM or DBMS developers care about
        their part. It’s likely, that they are quite good at their job.

        Of course, you might end up being forced to use some wacky
        solution, you might end up using some inconsistent API with a
        bunch of “undocumented features”. Don’t mix those concerns into
        your core application and test away.

    This is the correct answer to the problem. We can isolate the code
    from the framework by inverting and injecting our dependencies,
    without inflicting too much so-called “design damage.” In your
    example, it becomes trivial to test without introducing needless
    indirection that simply exists to sidestep Rails’ insistence on
    inheritance over delegation, and all the baggage that accompanies
    it.
