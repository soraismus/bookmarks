SolarCoin cryptocurrency pays you to go green
=============================================

-   13:54 06 February 2014 by [**Jacob
    Aron**](/search?rbauthors=Jacob+Aron)

    Economics**](/topic/finance-economics) Topic Guide

A new cryptocurrency with a solar-powered twist could be just the
incentive we need to make the shift to clean energy. While most
cryptocurrencies are just themed copies of Bitcoin –
[Dogecoin](http://dogecoin.com/), based on a famous internet meme, is a
notable example – [SolarCoins](http://solarcoin.org) are a bit harder to
earn.

SolarCoin is based on [Bitcoin
technology](/article/mg22129553.700-bitcoin-how-its-core-technology-will-change-the-world.html),
but in addition to the usual way of generating coins through mining,
crunching numbers to try and solve a cryptographic puzzle, people can
earn them as a reward for generating solar energy.

People with solar panels on their house will receive solar renewable
energy certificates from their energy company in return for feeding a
megawatt-hour of electricity back into the grid. These certificates are
already [traded for cash](http://www.flettexchange.com/), but present
one to SolarCoin's organisers and you'll receive one coin – they expect
to start distribution in a matter of weeks.

True, the coins are worthless at the moment, but if people start using
the currency to support solar energy, it should acquire value. SolarCoin
Foundation spokesman Nick Gogerty says the initiative is aiming for $20
to $30 per SolarCoin, effectively providing solar panel owners with a
[crowdfunded feed-in
tariff](/article/mg20327251.900-better-world-generate-a-feedin-frenzy.html)and
encouraging more people to take part.

SolarCoin chose solar rather than another renewable technology because
investment in solar panels is easier than in wind turbines, for example.
"Solar is interesting because it can be very grassroots," says Gogerty.
He and a colleague first conceived of an [energy-backed asset in
2011](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1802166) but
couldn't make the idea work without a central bank. Bitcoin makes the
bank unnecessary. "We're very thankful for Bitcoin leading the change."

Bitcoin has been accused of wasting energy in the past because of the
computing power it takes to mine coins, but Gogerty says that SolarCoin
is 50 times more energy-efficient because its algorithm allows the total
number of coins to be mined faster – and that's before factoring in the
energy boost from new solar panels.

If SolarCoin succeeds, the model could even be applied to other
environmental projects, such as conserving the rainforest or endangered
species. "If someone can come up with the mechanism and the approach, it
would be a great thing," says Gogerty.

[Jem Bendell](http://jembendell.wordpress.com/) of the University of
Cumbria, UK, says SolarCoin is an interesting idea. "What it shows you
is we can use this technology that provides a distributed, secure,
public, global record for other things." But he cautions that many new
coins are launching on the back of the Bitcoin gold rush, and not all
will last. "The success or failure of SolarCoin will be whether people
buy it."
