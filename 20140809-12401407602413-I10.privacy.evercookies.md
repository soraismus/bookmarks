### How a new type of "evercookie" tracks you online

INTERNET firms want to gather as much information as possible about web
users' browsing habits, so they can serve more accurately targeted (and
hence more lucrative) advertisements. But consumers don't like being
spied on. As a result, modern web browsers have built-in features to
prevent some of the most common forms of tracking, in order to maintain
users' privacy. That has not deterred marketers, who have come up with
ever more inventive ways of keeping tabs on people's online behaviour.
Their latest trick exploits web browsers' ability to draw elaborate
graphics, and uses it to identify users. How does it work?

The traditional approach to tracking involves sending a tracking code,
stored in a small file called a "cookie", to a web browser when a
website is first visited. (Economist.com, like many other sites, uses
this approach.) On subsequent visits, the browser sends this code back
to the website along with page requests. Modern browsers make it easy to
disable such tracking, either by blocking the delivery of cookies
altogether or erasing them when the browser window is closed. Marketers
have therefore developed cleverer ways to store the tracking code using
so-called
"[evercookies](http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2010/10/browsers_track_eternally)",
which hide the code in various virtual nooks and crannies that exist in
modern web browsers. If a user deletes a cookie, an evercookie script
can then recreate it. The result is a cat-and-mouse battle between
browser manufacturers, who want to block the storage of tracking codes
on users' computers, and marketers, who continue to find new places to
hide them.

The latest variety of evercookie exploits the "canvas" element, a
feature of modern web browsers that enables them to display complex
graphics, images and type. The advent of canvas-capable browsers has
made possible elaborate games and applications that run entirely inside
the web browser. Researchers in Belgium and America have
[discovered](https://securehomes.esat.kuleuven.be/~gacar/persistent/index.html)
that a theoretical use of canvas described in 2012 is in fact being used
"in the wild". A script embedded in a web page draws a hidden image on
an invisible canvas, with a combination of text in different fonts and
shapes. The resulting image is then boiled down into a mathematical code
called a "hash". Because of variations in browser software, operating
systems, graphics hardware and installed fonts, it turns out that the
image drawn varies slightly from one computer to another, and can thus
be used to identify particular users. (This trick doesn't work well on
mobile devices, however, because their configurations do not vary enough
to make them uniquely identifiable.)

The main company found to be using this approach, AddThis, [told
ProPublica](http://www.propublica.org/article/meet-the-online-tracking-device-that-is-virtually-impossible-to-block)
that it was for research purposes, and not precise enough to be very
valuable. And it can be blocked: Tor, a specialist web-browser optimised
for anonymity and to be resistant to tracking, has an option to block
the transmission of image data drawn using the canvas element. Other
browsers and third-party software may follow suit. But the cat-and-mouse
game is certain to continue. The use of a seemingly innocuous bit of
code to pin down a browser's identity, even imperfectly, shows how keen
marketers are to find ways to track people, even when those people would
rather remain anonymous.

I see the benefit of targeted advertisements, but it could be achieved
without compromising anonymity by simply having browsers advertise a
short list of âlikesâ the user can select from.

It seems obvious something far greater than the advertisement industry
is driving the pervasive attack against privacy and anonymity.

I blow my cookies out on a regular basis - that is not a metaphor by the
way.

I also use ghostery
[https://www.ghostery.com/en/](https://www.ghostery.com/en/ "https://www.ghostery.com/en/")
to track who is looking at me - it's interesting that the Economist has
quite a few snooping around to see what I want...

Never Mind Farcebook - that's up in the thousands.

"Don't be evil" is the formal corporate motto (or slogan) of Google but
their search engine and Chrome browsers are quite intursive and
annoying.

"A moment on the lips, is a lifetime on the hips."

There's something vaguely, but powerfully sexual about that sentence.
