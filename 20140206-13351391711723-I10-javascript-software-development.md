### Today we're going to discuss an effective set of patterns for large-scale JavaScript application architecture. The material is based on my talk of the same name, last presented at LondonJS and inspired by [previous work](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/nicholas-zakas/zakas-architecture/) by Nicholas Zakas.

### Who am I and why am I writing about this topic?

I'm currently a JavaScript and UI developer at AOL helping to plan and
write the front-end architecture to our next generation of client-facing
applications. As these applications are both complex and often require
an architecture that is scalable and highly-reusable, it's one of my
responsibilities to ensure the patterns used to implement such
applications are as sustainable as possible.

I also consider myself something of a design pattern enthusiast
(although there are far more knowledgeable experts on this topic than
I). I've previously written the creative-commons book '[Essential
JavaScript Design
Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)'
and am in the middle of writing the more detailed follow up to this book
at the moment.

### Can you summarize this article in 140 characters?

In the event of you being short for time, here's the tweet-sized summary
of this article:

publish msgs, mediator acts as pub/sub mgr & facade handles security

### What exactly *is* a 'large' JavaScript application?

Before we begin, let us attempt to define what we mean when we refer to
a JavaScript application as being significantly 'large'. This is a
question I've found still challenges developers with many years of
experience in the field and the answer to this can be quite subjective.

As an experiment, I asked a few intermediate developers to try providing
their definition of it informally. One developer suggested 'a JavaScript
application with over 100,000 LOC' whilst another suggested 'apps with
over 1MB of JavaScript code written in-house'. Whilst valiant (if not
scary) suggestions, both of these are **incorrect** as the size of a
codebase does not always correlate to application complexity - those
100,000 LOC could easily represent quite trivial code.

My own definition may or may not be universally accepted, but I believe
that it's closer to what a large application actually represents.

In my view, large-scale JavaScript apps are **non-trivial** applications
requiring **significant** developer effort to maintain, where most heavy
lifting of data manipulation and display falls to the **browser**.

The last part of this definition is possibly the most significant.

### Let's review your current architecture.

If working on a significantly large JavaScript application, remember to
dedicate **sufficient time** to planning the underlying architecture
that makes the most sense. It's often more complex than you may
initially imagine.

I can't stress the importance of this enough - some developers I've seen
approach larger applications have stepped back and said 'Okay. Well,
there are a set of ideas and patterns that worked well for me on my last
medium-scale project. Surely they should mostly apply to something a
little larger, right?'. Whilst this may be true to an extent, please
don't take it for granted - **larger apps generally have greater
concerns that need to be factored in**. I'm going to discuss shortly why
spending a little more time planning out the structure to your
application is worth it in the long run.

Most JavaScript developers likely use a mixed combination of the
following for their current architecture:

-   custom widgets
-   models
-   views
-   controllers
-   templates
-   libraries/toolkits
-   an application core.

You probably also break down your application's functionality into
blocks of modules or apply other patterns for this. This is great, but
there are a number of potential problems you can run into if this
represents all of your application's structure.

##### 1. How much of this architecture is instantly re-usable?

Can single modules exist on their own independently? Are they
self-contained? Right now if I were to look at the codebase for a large
application you or your team were working on and selected a random
module, would it be possible for me to easily just drop it into a new
page and start using it on its own?. You may question the rationale
behind wanting to do this, however I encourage you to think about the
future. What if your company were to begin building more and more
non-trivial applications which shared some cross-over in functionality?.
If someone said, 'Our users love using the chat module in our mail
client. Let's drop that into our new collaborative editing suite', would
this be possible without significantly altering the code?.

##### 2. How much do modules depend on other modules in the system?

Are they tightly coupled? Before I dig into why this is a concern, I
should note that I understand it's not always possible to have modules
with absolutely no other dependencies in a system. At a granular level
you may well have modules that extend the base functionality of others,
but this question is more-so related to groups of modules with distinct
functionality. It should be possible for all of these distinct sets of
modules to work in your application without depending on too many other
modules being present or loaded in order to function.

##### 3. If specific parts of your application fail, can it still function?

If you're building a GMail-like application and your webmail module (or
modules) fail, this shouldn't block the rest of the UI or prevent users
from being able to use other parts of the page such as chat. At the same
time, as per before, modules should ideally be able to exist on their
own outside of your current application architecture. In my talks I
mention dynamic dependency (or module) loading based on expressed
user-intent as something related. For example, in GMail's case they
might have the chat module collapsed by default without the core module
code loaded on page initialization. If a user expressed an intent to use
the chat feature, only then would it be dynamically loaded. Ideally, you
want this to be possible without it negatively affecting the rest of
your application.

##### 4. How easily can you test individual modules?

When working on systems of significant scale where there's a potential
for millions of users to use (or mis-use) the different parts it, it's
essential that modules which may end up being re-used across a number of
different applications be sufficiently tested. Testing needs to be
possible for when the module both inside and outside of the architecture
for which it was initially built. In my view, this provides the most
assurance that it shouldn't break if dropped into another system.

### Think Long Term

When devising the architecture for your large application, it's
important to think ahead. Not just a month or a year from now, but
beyond that. What might change? It's of course impossible to guess
exactly how your application may grow, but there's certainly room to
consider what is likely. Here, there is at least one specific aspect of
your application that comes to mind.

Developers often couple their DOM manipulation code quite tightly with
the rest of their application - even when they've gone to the trouble of
separating their core logic down into modules. Think about it..why is
this not a good idea if we're thinking long-term?

One member of my audience suggested that it was because a rigid
architecture defined in the present may not be suitable for the future.
Whilst certainly true, there's another concern that may cost even more
if not factored in.

You may well decide to **switch** from using Dojo, jQuery, Zepto or YUI
to something entirely different for reasons of performance, security or
design in the future. This can become a problem because libraries are
not easily interchangeable and have high switching costs if tightly
coupled to your app.

If you're a Dojo developer (like some of the audience at my talk), you
may not have something better to switch to in the present, but who is to
say that in 2-3 years something better doesn't come out that you'll want
to switch to?.

This is a relatively trivial decision in smaller codebases but for
larger applications, having an architecture which is flexible enough to
support **not** caring about the libraries being used in your modules
can be of great benefit, both financially and from a time-saving
perspective.

To summarize, if you reviewed your architecture right now, could a
decision to switch libraries be made without rewriting your entire
application?. If not, consider reading on because I think the
architecture being outlined today may be of interest.

There are a number of influential JavaScript developers who have
previously outlined some of the concerns I've touched upon so far. Three
key quotes I would like to share from them are the following:

"The secret to building large apps is never build large apps. Break your
applications into small pieces. Then, assemble those testable,
bite-sized pieces into your big application" - **Justin Meyer, author
JavaScriptMVC**

"The key is to acknowledge from the start that you have no idea how this
will grow. When you accept that you don't know everything, you begin to
design the system defensively. You identify the key areas that may
change, which often is very easy when you put a little bit of time into
it. For instance, you should expect that any part of the app that
communicates with another system will likely change, so you need to
abstract that away." - **Nicholas Zakas, author 'High-performance
JavaScript websites'**

and last but not least:

"The more tied components are to each other, the less reusable they will
be, and the more difficult it becomes to make changes to one without
accidentally affecting another" - **Rebecca Murphey, author of jQuery
Fundamentals.**

These principles are essential to building an architecture that can
stand the test of time and should always be kept in mind.

### Brainstorming

Let's think about what we're trying to achieve for a moment.

We want a loosely coupled architecture with functionality broken down
into **independent modules** with ideally no inter-module dependencies.
Modules **speak** to the rest of the application when something
interesting happens and an **intermediate layer** interprets and reacts
to these messages.

For example, if we had a JavaScript application responsible for an
online bakery, one such 'interesting' message from a module might be
'batch 42 of bread rolls is ready for dispatch'.

We use a different layer to interpret messages from modules so that a)
modules don't directly access the core and b) modules don't need to
directly call or interact with other modules. This helps prevent
applications from falling over due to errors with specific modules and
provides us a way to kick-start modules which have fallen over.

Another concern is security. The reality is that most of us don't
consider internal application security as that much of a concern. We
tell ourselves that as we're structuring the application, we're
intelligent enough to figure out what should be publicly or privately
accessible.

However, wouldn't it help if you had a way to determine what a module
was permitted to do in the system? eg. if I know I've limited the
permissions in my system to not allow a public chat widget to interface
with an admin module or a module with DB-write permissions, I can limit
the chances of someone exploiting vulnerabilities I have yet to find in
the widget to pass some XSS in there. Modules shouldn‚Äôt be able to
access everything. They probably can in most current architectures, but
do they really need to be able to?

Having an intermediate layer handle permissions for which modules can
access which parts of your framework gives you added security. This
means a module is only able to do at most what we‚Äôve permitted it do.

The Proposed Architecture
-------------------------

The solution to the architecture we seek to define is a combination of
three well-known design patterns: the **module**, **facade** and
**mediator**.

Rather than the traditional model of modules directly communicating with
each other, in this decoupled architecture, they'll instead only publish
events of interest (ideally, without a knowledge of other modules in the
system). The mediator pattern will be used to both subscribe to messages
from these modules and handle what the appropriate response to
notifications should be. The facade pattern will be used to enforce
module permissions.

I will be going into more detail on each of these patterns below:

Module Theory

You probably already use some variation of modules in your existing
architecture. If however, you don't, this section will present a short
primer on them.

Modules are an **integral** piece of any robust application's
architecture and are typically single-purpose parts of a larger system
that are interchangeable.

Depending on how you implement modules, it's possible to define
dependencies for them which can be automatically loaded to bring
together all of the other parts instantly. This is considered more
scalable than having to track the various dependencies for them and
manually load modules or inject script tags.

Any significantly non-trivial application should be built from modular
components. Going back to GMail, you could consider modules independent
units of functionality that can exist on their own, so the chat feature
for example. It's probably backed by a chat module, however, depending
on how complex that unit of functionality is, it may well have more
granular sub-modules that it depends on. For example, one could have a
module simply to handle the use of emoticons which can be shared across
both chat and mail composition parts of the system.

In the architecture being discussed, modules have a **very limited
knowledge** of what's going on in the rest of the system. Instead, we
delegate this responsibility to a mediator via a facade.

This is by design because if a module only cares about letting the
system know when something of interest happens without worrying if other
modules are running, a system is capable of supporting adding, removing
or replacing modules without the rest of the modules in the system
falling over due to tight coupling.

Loose coupling is thus essential to this idea being possible. It
facilitates easier maintainability of modules by removing code
dependencies where possible. In our case, modules should not rely on
other modules in order to function correctly. When loose coupling is
implemented effectively, its straight-forward to see how changes to one
part of a system may affect another.

In JavaScript, there are several options for implementing modules
including the well-known module pattern and object literals. Experienced
developers will already be familiar with these and if so, please skip
ahead to the section on CommonJS modules.

##### The Module Pattern

The module pattern is a popular design that pattern that encapsulates
'privacy', state and organization using closures. It provides a way of
wrapping a mix of public and private methods and variables, protecting
pieces from leaking into the global scope and accidentally colliding
with another developer's interface. With this pattern, only a public API
is returned, keeping everything else within the closure private.

This provides a clean solution for shielding logic doing the heavy
lifting whilst only exposing an interface you wish other parts of your
application to use. The pattern is quite similar to an
immediately-invoked functional expression
([IIFE](http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/))
except that an object is returned rather than a function.

It should be noted that there isn't really a true sense of 'privacy'
inside JavaScript because unlike some traditional languages, it doesn't
have access modifiers. Variables can't technically be declared as being
public nor private and so we use function scope to simulate this
concept. Within the module pattern, variables or methods declared are
only available inside the module itself thanks to closure. Variables or
methods defined within the returning object however are available to
everyone.

Below you can see an example of a shopping basket implemented using the
pattern. The module itself is completely self-contained in a global
object called `basketModule`. The `basket` array in the module is kept
private and so other parts of your application are unable to directly
read it. It only exists with the module's closure and so the only
methods able to access it are those with access to its scope (ie.
`addItem()`, `getItem()` etc).

~~~~ {.prettyprint .linenums}

var basketModule = (function() {
    var basket = []; //private
    return { //exposed to public
        addItem: function(values) {
            basket.push(values);
        },
        getItemCount: function() {
            return basket.length;
        },
        getTotal: function(){
           var q = this.getItemCount(),p=0;
            while(q--){
                p+= basket[q].price; 
            }
            return p;
        }
    }
}());
~~~~

Inside the module, you'll notice we return an `object`. This gets
automatically assigned to `basketModule` so that you can interact with
it as follows:

~~~~ {.prettyprint .linenums}

//basketModule is an object with properties which can also be methods
basketModule.addItem({item:'bread',price:0.5});
basketModule.addItem({item:'butter',price:0.3});

console.log(basketModule.getItemCount());
console.log(basketModule.getTotal());

//however, the following will not work:
console.log(basketModule.basket);// (undefined as not inside the returned object)
console.log(basket); //(only exists within the scope of the closure)
~~~~

The methods above are effectively namespaced inside `basketModule`.

From a historical perspective, the module pattern was originally
developed by a number of people including [Richard
Cornford](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.javascript/msg/9f58bd11bd67d937)
in 2003. It was later popularized by Douglas Crockford in his lectures
and re-introduced by Eric Miraglia on the YUI blog.

How about the module pattern in specific toolkits or frameworks?

**Dojo**

Dojo attempts to provide 'class'-like functionality through
`dojo.declare`, which can be used for amongst other things, creating
implementations of the module pattern. For example, if we wanted to
declare `basket` as a module of the `store` namespace, this could be
achieved as follows:

~~~~ {.prettyprint .linenums}
//traditional way
var store = window.store || {};
store.basket = store.basket || {};

//using dojo.setObject
dojo.setObject("store.basket.object", (function() {
    var basket = [];
    function privateMethod() {
        console.log(basket);
    }
    return {
        publicMethod: function(){
                privateMethod();
        }
    };
}()));
~~~~

which can become quite powerful when used with `dojo.provide` and
mixins.

**YUI**

The following example is heavily based on the original YUI module
pattern implementation by Eric Miraglia, but is relatively
self-explanatory.

~~~~ {.prettyprint .linenums}
YAHOO.store.basket = function () {

    //"private" variables:
    var myPrivateVar = "I can be accessed only within YAHOO.store.basket .";

    //"private" method:
    var myPrivateMethod = function () {
            YAHOO.log("I can be accessed only from within YAHOO.store.basket");
        }

    return {
        myPublicProperty: "I'm a public property.",
        myPublicMethod: function () {
            YAHOO.log("I'm a public method.");

            //Within basket, I can access "private" vars and methods:
            YAHOO.log(myPrivateVar);
            YAHOO.log(myPrivateMethod());

            //The native scope of myPublicMethod is store so we can
            //access public members using "this":
            YAHOO.log(this.myPublicProperty);
        }
    };

}();
~~~~

**jQuery**

There are a number of ways in which jQuery code unspecific to plugins
can be wrapped inside the module pattern. Ben Cherry previously
suggested an implementation where a function wrapper is used around
module definitions in the event of there being a number of commonalities
between modules.

In the following example, a `library` function is defined which declares
a new library and automatically binds up the `init` function to
`document.ready` when new libraries (ie. modules) are created.

~~~~ {.prettyprint .linenums}

function library(module) {
  $(function() {
    if (module.init) {
      module.init();
    }
  });
  return module;
}

var myLibrary = library(function() {
   return {
     init: function() {
       /*implementation*/
     }
   };
}());
~~~~

##### Object Literal Notation

In object literal notation, an object is described as a set of
comma-separated name/value pairs enclosured in curly braces (`{}`).
Names inside the object may be either strings or identifiers that are
followed by a colon. There should be no comma used after the final
name/value pair in the object as this may result in errors.

Object literals don't require instantiation using the `new` operator but
shouldn't be used at the start of a statement as the opening `{` may be
interpreted as the beginning of a block. Below you can see an example of
a module defined using object literal syntax. New members may be added
to the object using assignment as follows
`myModule.property = 'someValue';`

Whilst the module pattern is useful for many things, if you find
yourself not requiring specific properties or methods to be private, the
object literal is a more than suitable alternative.

~~~~ {.prettyprint .linenums}
var myModule = {
¬† ¬†¬†myProperty : 'someValue',
¬† ¬†¬†//object literals can contain properties and methods.
¬† ¬†¬†//here, another object is defined for configuration
¬† ¬†¬†//purposes:
¬† ¬†¬†myConfig:{
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†useCaching:true,
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†language: 'en'¬† ¬†
¬† ¬†¬†},
¬† ¬†¬†//a very basic method
¬† ¬†¬†myMethod: function(){
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†console.log('I can haz functionality?');
¬† ¬†¬†},
¬† ¬†¬†//output a value based on current configuration
¬† ¬†¬†myMethod2: function(){
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†console.log('Caching is:' + (this.myConfig.useCaching)?'enabled':'disabled');
¬† ¬†¬†},
¬† ¬†¬†//override the current configuration
¬† ¬†¬†myMethod3: function(newConfig){
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†if(typeof newConfig == 'object'){
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†this.myConfig = newConfig;
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†console.log(this.myConfig.language); 
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†}
¬† ¬†¬†}
};

myModule.myMethod(); //I can haz functionality
myModule.myMethod2(); //outputs enabled
myModule.myMethod3({language:'fr',useCaching:false}); //fr

### CommonJS Modules

Over the last year or two, you may have heard about
[CommonJS](http://commonjs.org) - a volunteer working group which
designs, prototypes and standardizes JavaScript APIs. To date they've
ratified standards for modules and packages.The CommonJS AMD proposal
specifies a simple API for declaring modules which can be used with both
synchronous and asynchronous script tag loading in the browser. Their
module pattern is relatively clean and I consider it a reliable stepping
stone to the module system proposed for ES Harmony (the next release of
the JavaScript language).

From a structure perspective, a CommonJS module is a reusable piece of
JavaScript which exports specific objects made available to any
dependent code. This module format is becoming quite ubiquitous as a
standard module format for JS. There are plenty of great tutorials on
implementing CommonJS modules, but at a high-level they basically
contain two primary parts: an `exports` object that contains the objects
a module wishes to make available to other modules and a `require`
function that modules can use to import the exports of other modules.

~~~~ {.prettyprint .linenums}
/*
Example of achieving compatibility with AMD and standard CommonJS by putting boilerplate around the standard CommonJS module format:
*/

(function(define){
define(function(require,exports){
// module contents
 var dep1 = require("dep1");
 exports.someExportedFunction = function(){...};
 //...
});
})(typeof define=="function"?define:function(factory){factory(require,exports)});
~~~~

There are a number of great JavaScript libraries for handling module
loading in the **CommonJS** module format, but my personal preference is
RequireJS. A complete tutorial on RequireJS is outside the scope of this
tutorial, but I can recommend reading James Burke's ScriptJunkie post on
it [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/ff943568). I know
a number of people that also like Yabble.

Out of the box, RequireJS provides methods for easing how we create
static modules with wrappers and it's extremely easy to craft modules
with support for asynchronous loading. It can easily load modules and
their dependencies this way and execute the body of the module once
available.

There are some developers that however claim CommonJS modules aren't
suitable enough for the browser. The reason cited is that they can't be
loaded via a script tag without some level of server-side assistance. We
can imagine having a library for encoding images as ASCII art which
might export a `encodeToASCII` function. A module from this could
resemble:

~~~~ {.prettyprint .linenums}
var encodeToASCII = require("encoder").encodeToASCII;
exports.encodeSomeSource = function(){
    //process then call encodeToASCII
}
~~~~

This type of scenario wouldn't work with a script tag because the scope
isn't wrapped, meaning our `encodeToASCII` method would be attached to
the `window`, `require` wouldn't be as such defined and exports would
need to be created for each module separately. A client-side library
together with server-side assistance or a library loading the script
with an XHR request using `eval()` could however handle this easily.

Using RequireJS, the module from earlier could be rewritten as follows:

~~~~ {.prettyprint .linenums}
define(function(require, exports, module) {
    var encodeToASCII = require("encoder").encodeToASCII;
    exports.encodeSomeSource = function(){
            //process then call encodeToASCII
    }
});
~~~~

For developers who may not rely on just using static JavaScript for
their projects, CommonJS modules are an excellent path to go down, but
do spend some time reading up on it. I've really only covered the tip of
the ice berg but both the CommonJS wiki and Sitepen have a number of
resources if you wish to read further.

### The Facade Pattern

Next, we're going to look at the facade pattern, a design pattern which
plays a critical role in the architecture being defined today.

When you put up a facade, you're usually creating an outward appearance
which conceals a different reality. The facade pattern provides a
convenient **higher-level interface** to a larger body of code, hiding
its true underlying complexity. Think of it as simplifying the API being
presented to other developers.

Facades are a **structural pattern** which can often be seen in
JavaScript libraries and frameworks where, although an implementation
may support methods with a wide range of behaviors, only a 'facade' or
limited abstract of these methods is presented to the client for use.

This allows us to interact with the facade rather than the subsystem
behind the scenes.

The reason the facade is of interest is because of its ability to hide
implementation-specific details about a body of functionality contained
in individual modules. The implementation of a module can change without
the clients really even knowing about it.

By maintaining a consistent facade (simplified API), the worry about
whether a module extensively uses dojo, jQuery, YUI, zepto or something
else becomes significantly less important. As long as the interaction
layer doesn't change, you retain the ability to switch out libraries
(eg. jQuery for Dojo) at a later point without affecting the rest of the
system.

Below is a very basic example of a facade in action. As you can see, our
module contains a number of methods which have been privately defined. A
facade is then used to supply a much simpler API to accessing these
methods:

~~~~ {.prettyprint .linenums}
var module = (function() {
¬† ¬†¬†var _private = {
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†i:5,
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†get : function() {
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†console.log('current value:' + this.i);
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†},
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†set : function( val ) {
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†this.i = val;
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†},
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†run : function() {
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†console.log('running');
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†},
        jump: function(){
            console.log('jumping');
        }
¬† ¬†¬†};
¬† ¬†¬†return {
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†facade : function( args ) {
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†_private.set(args.val);
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†_private.get();
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†if ( args.run ) {
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†_private.run();
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†}
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†}
¬† ¬†¬†}
}());


module.facade({run: true, val:10});
//outputs current value: 10, running
~~~~

and that's really it for the facade before we apply it to our
architecture. Next, we'll be diving into the exciting mediator pattern.
The core difference between the facade pattern and the mediator is that
the facade (a structural pattern) only exposes existing functionality
whilst the mediator (a behavioral pattern) can add functionality.

### The Mediator Pattern

The mediator pattern is best introduced with a simple analogy - think of
your typical airport traffic control. The tower handles what planes can
take off and land because all communications are done from the planes to
the control tower, rather than from plane-to-plane. A centralized
controller is key to the success of this system and that's really what a
mediator is.

Mediators are used when the communication between modules may be
complex, but is still **well defined**. If it appears a system may have
too many relationships between modules in your code, it may be time to
have a central point of control, which is where the pattern fits in.

In real-world terms, a mediator**encapsulates** how disparate modules
**interact** with each other by acting as an intermediary. The pattern
also promotes loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to
each other explicitly - in our system, this helps to solve our module
inter-dependency issues.

What other advantages does it have to offer? Well, mediators allow for
actions of each module to vary independently, so it‚Äôs extremely
flexible. If you've previously used the Observer (Pub/Sub) pattern to
implement an event broadcast system between the modules in your system,
you'll find mediators relatively easy to understand.

Let's take a look at a high level view of how modules might interact
with a mediator:

![image](assets/img/chart4a.jpg)

Consider modules as publishers and the mediator as both a publisher and
subscriber. Module 1 broadcasts an event notifying the mediator
something needs to done. The mediator captures this message and 'starts'
the modules needed to complete this task Module 2 performs the task that
Module 1 requires and broadcasts a completion event back to the
mediator. In the mean time, Module 3 has also been started by the
mediator and is logging results of any notifications passed back from
the mediator.

Notice how at no point do any of the modules**directly communicate**
with one another. If Module 3 in the chain were to simply fail or stop
functioning, the mediator could hypothetically 'pause' the tasks on the
other modules, stop and restart Module 3 and then continue working with
little to no impact on the system. This level of decoupling is one of
the main strengths the pattern has to offer.

To review, the advantages of the mediator are that:

It decouples modules by introducing an intermediary as a central point
of control.It allows modules to broadcast or listen for messages without
being concerned with the rest of the system. Messages can be handled by
any number of modules at once.

It is typically significantly more easy to add or remove features to
systems which are loosely coupled like this.

And its disadvantages:

By adding a mediator between modules, they must always communicate
indirectly. This can cause a very minor performance drop - because of
the nature of loose coupling, its difficult to establish how a system
might react by only looking at the broadcasts. At the end of the day,
tight coupling causes all kinds of headaches and this is one solution.

**Example:** This is a possible implementation of the mediator pattern
based on previous work by [@rpflorence](https://github.com/rpflorence)

~~~~ {.prettyprint .linenums}
var mediator = (function(){
¬† ¬†¬†var subscribe = function(channel, fn){
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†if (!mediator.channels[channel]) mediator.channels[channel] = [];
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†mediator.channels[channel].push({ context: this, callback: fn });
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†return this;
¬† ¬†¬†},

¬† ¬†¬†publish = function(channel){
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†if (!mediator.channels[channel]) return false;
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1);
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†for (var i = 0, l = mediator.channels[channel].length; i < l; i++) {
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†var subscription = mediator.channels[channel][i];
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†subscription.callback.apply(subscription.context, args);
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†}
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†return this;
¬† ¬†¬†};

¬† ¬†¬†return {
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†channels: {},
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†publish: publish,
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†subscribe: subscribe,
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†installTo: function(obj){
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†obj.subscribe = subscribe;
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†obj.publish = publish;
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†}
¬† ¬†¬†};

}());
~~~~

**Example:** Here are two sample uses of the implementation from above.
It's effectively managed publish/subscribe:

~~~~ {.prettyprint .linenums}
//Pub/sub on a centralized mediator

mediator.name = "tim";
mediator.subscribe('nameChange', function(arg){
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†console.log(this.name);
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†this.name = arg;
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†console.log(this.name);
});

mediator.publish('nameChange', 'david'); //tim, david


//Pub/sub via third party mediator

var obj = { name: 'sam' };
mediator.installTo(obj);
obj.subscribe('nameChange', function(arg){
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†console.log(this.name);
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†this.name = arg;
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†console.log(this.name);
});

obj.publish('nameChange', 'john'); //sam, john

### **Applying The Facade: Abstraction Of The Core**

In the architecture suggested:

A facade serves as an **abstraction** of the application core which sits
between the mediator and our modules - it should ideally be the **only**
other part of the system modules are aware of.

The responsibilities of the abstraction include ensuring a **consistent
interface** to these modules is available at all times. This closely
resembles the role of the **sandbox controller** in the excellent
architecture first suggested by Nicholas Zakas.

Components are going to communicate with the mediator through the facade
so it needs to be **dependable**. When I say 'communicate', I should
clarify that as the facade is an abstraction of the mediator which will
be listening out for broadcasts from modules that will be relayed back
to the mediator.

In addition to providing an interface to modules, the facade also acts
as a security guard, determining which parts of the application a module
may access. Components only call **their own** methods and shouldn't be
able to interface with anything they don't have permission to. For
example, a module may broadcast `dataValidationCompletedWriteToDB`. The
idea of a security check here is to ensure that the module has
permissions to request database-write access. What we ideally want to
avoid are issues with modules accidentally trying to do something they
shouldn't be.

To review in short, the mediator remains a type of pub/sub manager but
is only passed interesting messages once they've cleared permission
checks by the facade.

### **Applying the Mediator: The Application Core**

The mediator plays the role of the application core. We've briefly
touched on some of its responsibilities but lets clarify what they are
in full.

The core's primary job is to manage the module **lifecycle.**When the
core detects an**interesting message** it needs to decide how the
application should react - this effectively means deciding whether a
module or set of modules needs to be **started** or**stopped**.

Once a module has been started, it should ideally execute
**automatically**. It's not the core's task to decide whether this
should be when the DOM is ready and there's enough scope in the
architecture for modules to make such decisions on their own.

You may be wondering in what circumstance a module might need to be
'stopped' - if the application detects that a particular module has
failed or is experiencing significant errors, a decision can be made to
prevent methods in that module from executing further so that it may be
restarted. The goal here is to assist in reducing disruption to the user
experience.

In addition, the core should enable **adding or removing** modules
without breaking anything. A typical example of where this may be the
case is functionality which may not be available on initial page load,
but is dynamically loaded based on expressed user-intent eg. going back
to our GMail example, Google could keep the chat widget collapsed by
default and only dynamically load in the chat module(s) when a user
expresses an interest in using that part of the application. From a
performance optimization perspective, this may make sense.

Error management will also be handled by the application core. In
addition to modules broadcasting messages of interest they will also
broadcast any errors experienced which the core can then react to
accordingly (eg. stopping modules, restarting them etc).It's important
that as part of a decoupled architecture there to be enough scope for
the introduction of new or better ways of handling or displaying errors
to the end user without manually having to change each module. Using
publish/subscribe through a mediator allows us to achieve this.

### **Tying It All Together**

-   **Modules** contain specific pieces of functionality for your
    application. They publish notifications informing the application
    whenever something interesting happens - this is their primary
    concern. As I'll cover in the FAQs, modules can depend on DOM
    utility methods, but ideally shouldn't depend on any other modules
    in the system. They should not be concerned with:

    -   what objects or modules are subscribing to the messages they
        publish
    -   where these objects are based (whether this is on the client or
        server)
    -   how many objects subscribe to notifications

-   **The Facade** abstracts the core to avoid modules touching it
    directly. It subscribes to interesting events (from modules) and
    says 'Great! What happened? Give me the details!'. It also handles
    module security by checking to ensure the module broadcasting an
    event has the necessary permissions to pass such events that can be
    accepted.
-   **The Mediator (Application Core)** acts as a 'Pub/Sub' manager
    using the mediator pattern. It's responsible for module management
    and starts/stops modules as needed. This is of particular use for
    dynamic dependency loading and ensuring modules which fail can be
    centrally restarted as needed.

    **![image](assets/img/chart3a.gif)**

The result of this architecture is that modules (in most cases) are
theoretically no longer dependent on other modules. They can be easily
tested and maintained on their own and because of the level of
decoupling applied, modules can be picked up and dropped into a new page
for use in another project without significant additional effort. They
can also be dynamically added or removed without the application falling
over.

### Beyond Pub/Sub: Automatic Event Registration

As previously mentioned by Michael Mahemoff, when thinking about
large-scale JavaScript, it can be of benefit to exploit some of the more
dynamic features of the language. You can read more about some of the
concerns highlighted on Michael's
[G+](https://plus.google.com/106413090159067280619/posts/hDZkVrDXZR6)
page, but I would like to focus on one specifically - automatic event
registration (AER).

AER solves the problem of wiring up subscribers to publishers by
introducing a pattern which auto-wires based on naming conventions. For
example, if a module publishes an event called `messageUpdate`, anything
with a `messageUpdate` method would be automatically called.

The setup for this pattern involves registering all components which
might subscribe to events, registering all events that may be subscribed
to and finally for each subscription method in your component-set,
binding the event to it. It's a very interesting approach which is
related to the architecture presented in this post, but does come with
some interesting challenges.

For example, when working dynamically, objects may be required to
register themselves upon creation. Please feel free to check out
Michael's [post](http://softwareas.com/automagic-event-registration) on
AER as he discusses how to handle such issues in more depth.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: Is it possible to avoid implementing a sandbox or facade altogether?

A: Although the architecture outlined uses a facade to implement
security features, it's entirely possible to get by using a mediator and
pub/sub to communicate events of interest throughout the application
without it. This lighter version would offer a similar level of
decoupling, but ensure you're comfortable with modules directly touching
the application core (mediator) if opting for this variation.

#### Q: You've mentioned modules not having any dependencies. Does this include dependencies such as third party libraries (eg. jQuery?)

A: I'm specifically referring to dependencies on other modules here.
What some developers opting for an architecture such as this opt for is
actually abstracting utilities common to DOM libraries -eg. one could
have a DOM utility class for query selectors which when used returns the
result of querying the DOM using jQuery (or, if you switched it out at a
later point, Dojo). This way, although modules still query the DOM, they
aren't directly using hardcoded functions from any particular library or
toolkit. There's quite a lot of variation in how this might be achieved,
but the takeaway is that ideally core modules shouldn't depend on other
modules if opting for this architecture.

You'll find that when this is the case it can sometimes be more easy to
get a complete module from one project working in another with little
extra effort. I should make it clear that I fully agree that it can
sometimes be significantly more sensible for modules to extend or use
other modules for part of their functionality, however bear in mind that
this can in some cases increase the effort required to make such modules
'liftable' for other projects.

#### Q: I'd like to start using this architecture today. Is there any boilerplate code around I can work from?

A: I plan on releasing a free boilerplate pack for this post when time
permits, but at the moment, your best bet is probably the '[Writing
Modular JavaScript](http://bit.ly/orGVOL)' premium tutorial by Andrew
Burgees (for complete disclosure, this is a referral link as any credits
received are re-invested into reviewing material before I recommend it
to others). Andrew's pack includes a screencast and code and covers most
of the main concepts outlined in this post but opts for calling the
facade a 'sandbox', as per Zakas. There's some discussion regarding just
how DOM library abstraction should be ideally implemented in such an
architecture - similar to my answer for the second question, Andrew opts
for some interesting patterns on generalizing query selectors so that at
most, switching libraries is a change that can be made in a few short
lines. I'm not saying this is the right or best way to go about this,
but it's an approach I personally also use.

#### Q: If the modules need to directly communicate with the core, is this possible?

A: As Zakas has previously hinted, there's technically no reason why
modules shouldn't be able to access the core but this is more of a best
practice than anything. If you want to strictly stick to this
architecture you'll need to follow the rules defined or opt for a looser
architecture as per the answer to the first question.
