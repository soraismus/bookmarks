How to Build a Maze

![image](../../images/spectrum3.gif)

\
 It's easier than you think.

Our objective here is to create a *perfect* maze, the simplest type of
maze for a computer to generate and solve. A perfect maze is defined as
a maze which has one and only one path from any point in the maze to any
other point. This means that the maze has no inaccessible sections, no
circular paths, no open areas.

We'll assume a rectangular maze, since that's the easiest type to
create, but with the method presented here, we can create mazes of
almost any shape and size, even 3-dimensional ones. To begin with, we'll
need a grid:

![image](tut3.gif)

Each square of the grid is a **cell**. The horizontal and vertical lines
represent the walls of the maze. The generation algorithm we're using
will assume that, at the beginning, all the walls of the maze are *up*.
Then we selectively knock down walls until we've made a working maze
that fits our definition of "perfect."

We'll need a data structure to store information about the cells. But
exactly what data should we be tracking? Assuming that we're interested
in solving the maze as well as creating it, here's a graphical
representation of all the information necessary:

![image](tut4.gif)

The maze borders are gray, the walls are white, the starting position is
green, the ending position is red, the solution path is yellow, and the
backtrack path is light gray.

The start and end points can easily be stored as individual variables.
Then all we need to track, for each cell in the grid, are:

-   Any **borders** the cell has
-   Which **walls** are still up
-   If the **solution** path goes through it, and in which directions
-   If the **backtrack** path goes through it, and in which directions

Here's one way to do it (this is by no means the only way): a 12x16 maze
grid can be represented as an array **`m[16][12]`** of 16-bit integers.
Each array element would contains all the information for a single
corresponding cell in the grid, with the integer bits mapped like this:

![image](tut5.gif)

To knock down a wall, set a border, or create a particular path, all we
need to do is flip bits in one or two array elements.

You might think we don't really need to track the borders, since we
could just use the minimum and maximum array indices to determine them.
That's true, but storing border information in the array makes our maze
much more flexible. It means we can easily change the shape of the maze
in various ways and still be able to use our 2D array and maze
generating algorithm without any code modification. \

 With a data structure in place for holding the maze information, we can
initialize the maze by setting the appropriate borders and putting up
all of the walls. Then we're ready to implement the algorithm. \
 \
 **Depth-First Search** \
 \
 This is the simplest maze generation algorithm. It works like this:

Here's the DFS algorithm written as pseudocode:

\

\
 create a `CellStack` (LIFO) to hold a list of cell locations \
 set `TotalCells` = number of cells in grid \
 choose a cell at random and call it `CurrentCell` \
 set `VisitedCells` = 1 \
 \
 while `VisitedCells` < `TotalCells`

find all neighbors of `CurrentCell` with all walls intact \
 if one or more found

else

endIf

endWhile \

\

When the `while` loop terminates, the algorithm is completed. Every cell
has been visited and thus no cell is inaccessible. Also, since we test
each possible move to see if we've already been there, the algorithm
prevents the creation of any open areas, or paths that circle back on
themselves.

We can put the start and end points wherever we want. This is another
advantage of a perfect maze. Since, by definition, one and only one path
will exist between any two points in the maze, we know that given a
start/end pair, a unique solution to the maze must exist.

Depth-First Search is the most common algorithm used in maze generation
programs: it's simple to implement, works quickly, and generates very
pretty mazes. The algorithm can also be used to solve mazes. This is how
MazeGen generates solutions for all mazes, no matter which algorithm was
used to create them.
