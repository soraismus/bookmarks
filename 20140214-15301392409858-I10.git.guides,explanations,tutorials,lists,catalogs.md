I have seen [interesting
posts](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1634115/whats-the-difference-between-git-reset-hard-and-git-reset-merge)
explaining subtleties about `git reset`.

Unfortunately, the more I read about it, the more it appears that I
don't understand it fully. I come from a SVN background and Git is a
whole new paradigm. I got mercurial easily, but Git is much more
technical.

I think `git reset` is close to `hg revert`, but it seems there are
differences.

So what exactly does `git reset` do? Please include detailed
explanations about:

-   the options `--hard`, `--soft` and `--merge`;
-   the strange notation you use with `HEAD` such as `HEAD^` and
    `HEAD~1`;
-   concrete use cases and work flows;
-   consequences on the working copy, the `HEAD` and your global stress
    level.

Holly blessing and tons of chocolate/beer/name\_your\_stuff to the guy
who makes a no-brainer answer :-)

I do think the docs really are quite good for this - perhaps you do need
a bit of a sense of the way git works for them to really sink in though.
In particular, if you take the time to carefully read them, those tables
detailing states of files in index and work tree for all the various
options and cases are very very helpful. (But yes, they're very dense -
takes me a while just to read them and confirm they say what I already
know.)

In general, git reset's function is to take the current branch and reset
it to point somewhere else, and possibly bring the index and work tree
along. More concretely, if your master branch (currently checked out) is
like this:

    - A - B - C (HEAD, master)

and you realize you want master to point to B, not C, you will use
`git reset B` to move it there:

    - A - B (HEAD, master)      # - C is still here, but there's no branch pointing to it anymore

Digression: This is different from a checkout. If you'd run
`git checkout B`, you'd get this:

    - A - B (HEAD) - C (master)

You've ended up in a detached HEAD state. `HEAD`, work tree, index all
match `B`, but the master branch was left behind at `C`. If you make a
new commit `D` at this point, you'll get this, which is probably not
what you want:

    - A - B - C (master)
           \
            D (HEAD)

Remember, reset doesn't make commits, it just updates a branch (which is
a pointer to a commit) to point to a different commit. The rest is just
details of what happens to your index and work tree.

Use cases
=========

I cover many of the main use cases for `git reset` within my
descriptions of the various options in the next section. It can really
be used for a wide variety of things; the common thread is that all of
them involve resetting the branch, index, and/or work tree to point
to/match a given commit.

Things to be careful of
=======================

-   `--hard` can cause you to really lose work. It modifies your work
    tree.

-   `git reset [options] commit` can cause you to (sort of) lose
    commits. In the toy example above, we lost commit `C`. It's still in
    the repo, and you can find it by looking at `git reflog show HEAD`
    or `git reflog show master`, but it's not actually accessible from
    any branch anymore.

-   Git permanently deletes such commits after 30 days, but until then
    you can recover C by pointing a branch at it again
    (`git checkout C; git branch <new branch name>`).

Arguments
=========

Paraphrasing the man page, most common usage is of the form
`git reset [<commit>] [paths...]`, which will reset the given paths to
their state from the given commit. If the paths aren't provided, the
entire tree is reset, and if the commit isn't provided, it's taken to be
HEAD (the current commit). This is a common pattern across git commands
(e.g. checkout, diff, log, though the exact semantics vary), so it
shouldn't be too surprising.

For example, `git reset other-branch path/to/foo` resets everything in
path/to/foo to its state in other-branch, `git reset -- .` resets the
current directory to its state in HEAD, and a simple `git reset` resets
everything to its state in HEAD.

The main work tree and index options
====================================

There are four main options to control what happens to your work tree
and index during the reset.

Remember, the index is git's "staging area" - it's where things go when
you say `git add` in preparation to commit.

-   `--hard` makes everything match the commit you've reset to. This is
    the easiest to understand, probably. All of your local changes get
    clobbered. One primary use is blowing away your work but not
    switching commits: `git reset --hard` means `git reset --hard HEAD`,
    i.e. don't change the branch but get rid of all local changes. The
    other is simply moving a branch from one place to another, and
    keeping index/work tree in sync. *This is the one that can really
    make you lose work, because it modifies your work tree.* Be very
    very sure you want to throw away local work before you run any
    `reset --hard`.

-   `--mixed` is the default, i.e. `git reset` means
    `git reset --mixed`. It resets the index, but not the work tree.
    This means all your files are intact, but any differences between
    the original commit and the one you reset to will show up as local
    modifications (or untracked files) with git status. Use this when
    you realize you made some bad commits, but you want to keep all the
    work you've done so you can fix it up and recommit. In order to
    commit, you'll have to add files to the index again (`git add ...`).

-   `--soft` doesn't touch the index *or* work tree. All your files are
    intact as with `--mixed`, but all the changes show up as
    `changes to be committed` with git status (i.e. checked in in
    preparation for committing). Use this when you realize you've made
    some bad commits, but the work's all good - all you need to do is
    recommit it differently. The index is untouched, so you can commit
    immediately if you want - the resulting commit will have all the
    same content as where you were before you reset.

-   `--merge` was added recently, and is intended to help you abort a
    failed merge. This is necessary because `git merge` will actually
    let you attempt a merge with a dirty work tree (one with local
    modifications) as long as those modifications are in files
    unaffected by the merge. `git reset --merge` resets the index (like
    `--mixed` - all changes show up as local modifications), and resets
    the files affected by the merge, but leaves the others alone. This
    will hopefully restore everything to how it was before the bad
    merge. You'll usually use it as `git reset --merge` (meaning
    `git reset --merge HEAD`) because you only want to reset away the
    merge, not actually move the branch. (`HEAD` hasn't been updated
    yet, since the merge failed)

    To be more concrete, suppose you've modified files A and B, and you
    attempt to merge in a branch which modified files C and D. The merge
    fails for some reason, and you decide to abort it. You use
    `git reset --merge`. It brings C and D back to how they were in
    `HEAD`, but leaves your modifications to A and B alone, since they
    weren't part of the attempted merge.

Strange notation
================

The "strange notation" (`HEAD^` and `HEAD~1`) you mention is simply a
shorthand for specifying commits, without having to use a hash name like
`3ebe3f6`. It's fully documented in the ["specifying revisions"
section](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rev-parse.html#_specifying_revisions)
of the man page for git-rev-parse, with lots of examples and related
syntax. The caret and the tilde actually mean [different
things](http://paulboxley.com/blog/2011/06/git-caret-and-tilde):

-   `HEAD~` is short for `HEAD~1` and means the commit's first parent.
    `HEAD~2` means the commit's first parent's first parent. Think of
    `HEAD~n` as "n commits before HEAD" or "the nth generation ancestor
    of HEAD".
-   `HEAD^` (or `HEAD^1`) also means the commit's first parent. `HEAD^2`
    means the commit's *second* parent. Remember, a normal merge commit
    has two parents - the first parent is the merged-into commit, and
    the second parent is the commit that was merged. In general, merges
    can actually have arbitrarily many parents (octopus merges).
-   The `^` and `~` operators can be strung together, as in `HEAD~3^2`,
    the second parent of the third-generation ancestor of `HEAD`,
    `HEAD^^2`, the second parent of the first parent of `HEAD`, or even
    `HEAD^^^`, which is equivalent to `HEAD~3`.

Remember that in `git` you have:

-   the *`HEAD` pointer*, which tells you what commit you're working on
-   the *working tree*, which represents the state of the files on your
    system
-   the *staging area* (also called the *index*), which "stages" changes
    so that they can later be committed together

> Please include detailed explanations about:
>
> `--hard`, `--soft` and `--merge`;

In increasing order of dangerous-ness:

-   `--soft` moves `HEAD` but doesn't touch the staging area or the
    working tree.
-   `--mixed` moves `HEAD` and updates the staging area, but not the
    working tree.
-   `--merge` moves `HEAD`, resets the staging area, and tries to move
    all the changes in your working tree into the new working tree.
-   `--hard` moves `HEAD` *and* adjusts your staging area and working
    tree to the new `HEAD`, throwing away everything.

> concrete use cases and workflows;

-   Use `--soft` when you want to move to another commit and patch
    things up without "losing your place". It's pretty rare that you
    need this.

--

    # git reset --soft example
    touch foo                            // Add a file, make some changes.
    git add foo                          // 
    git commit -m "bad commit message"   // Commit... D'oh, that was a mistake!
    git reset --soft HEAD^               // Go back one commit and fix things.
    git commit -m "good commit"          // There, now it's right.

--

-   Use `--mixed` (which is the default) when you want to see what
    things look like at another commit, but you don't want to lose any
    changes you already have.

-   Use `--merge` when you want to move to a new spot but incorporate
    the changes you already have into that the working tree.

-   Use `--hard` to wipe everything out and start a fresh slate at the
    new commit.

That's not the intended use case for `reset --merge`. It doesn't perform
a three-way merge. It's really only for resetting out of conflicted
merges, as described in the docs. You'll want to use `checkout --merge`
to do what you're talking about. If you want to move the branch as well,
I think the only way is to follow up with some checkout/reset to drag it
along. – [Jefromi](/users/119963/jefromi "103681 reputation") Mar 27 '10

@Jefromi » Yes, I didn't phrase that very well. By "a new spot" I meant
"a fresh place where you don't have the conflicted merge". – [John

Ah, I see. I think the important thing here is that unless you really
know what you're doing, you probably don't ever want to use
`reset --merge` with any target besides (the default) `HEAD`, because in
cases besides aborting a conflicted merge, it's going to throw away
information that you could otherwise save. –

The post [Reset
Demystified](http://git-scm.com/blog/2011/07/11/reset.html) in the blog
[Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/) gives a very *no-brainer* explanation on
`git reset` and `git checkout`.

After all the helpful discussion at the top of that post, the author
reduces the rules to the following simple three steps:

> That is basically it. The `reset` command overwrites these three trees
> in a specific order, stopping when you tell it to.
>
> 1.  Move whatever branch HEAD points to (stop if `--soft`)
> 2.  THEN, make the Index look like that (stop here unless `--hard`)
> 3.  THEN, make the Working Directory look like that
>
> There are also `--merge` and `--keep` options, but I would rather keep
> things simpler for now - that will be for another article.
