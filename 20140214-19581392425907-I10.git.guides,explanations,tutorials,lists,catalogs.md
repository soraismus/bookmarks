[How does git store files?](/questions/8198105/how-does-git-store-files)

I just started learning git and to do so I started reading the Git
Community Book available here:
[http://book.git-scm.com/](http://book.git-scm.com/) and in this book
they say that svn and cvs store the difference between files and that
git stores a snapshot of all the files.

But I didn't really get what they mean by snapshot. Does git really make
a copy of all the files in each commit because that's what I understood
from their explanation.

PS: If any one has any better source to learn git I would appreciate it.

Git does store for each commit a full copy of all the files, except
that, for the content already present in the Git repo, the snapshot will
simply point to said content rather than duplicate it.\
 That also means that several files with the same content are stored
only once.

So a snapshot is basically a commit, referring to the *content* of a
directory structure.

Some good references are:

> files in your project look like at that point

previous snapshots

While that's true and important on the conceptual level, it is NOT true
at the storage level. Git does use deltas for storage. Not only that,
but it's more efficient in it than any other system. Because it does not
keep per-file history, when it wants to do delta-compression, it takes
each blob, selects some blobs that are likely to be similar (using
heuristics that includes the closest approximation of previous version
and some others), tries to generate the deltas and picks the smallest
one. – [Jan Hudec](/users/201725/jan-hudec "23137 reputation") Jan 3 '13

in detail how git works. What you're looking for is probably the § about

Git logically stores each file under its SHA1. What this means is if you
have two files with exactly the same content in a repository (or if you
rename a file), only one copy is stored.

But this also means that when you modify a small part of a file and
commit, another copy of the file is stored. The way git solves this is
using pack files. Once in a while, all the “loose” files (actually, not
just files, but objects containing commit and directory information too)
from a repo are gathered and compressed into a pack file. The pack file
is compressed using zlib. And similar files are also delta-compressed.

The same format is also used when pulling or pushing (at least with some
protocols), so those files don't have to be recompressed again.

The result of this is that a git repository, containing the whole
uncompressed working copy, uncompressed recent files and compressed
older files is usually relatively small, smaller than twice the size of
the working copy. And this means it's smaller than SVN repo with the
same files, even though SVN doesn't store the history locally.

Yes, git does make a copy of files. The philosophy is that in most
situations, disk space is essentially free in large quantities.

This is why large resources (videos, sound recordings, etc.) are often
not tracked when using git. See, for instance, [this
discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1762413/is-git-worth-for-managing-many-files-bigger-than-500mb).

P.S. There's a nice introduction by Lars Vogel to git
[here](http://www.vogella.de/articles/Git/article.html).

Although if the file is not changed, then it is not copied. Also,
non-text files are not tracked with any vcs –

This completely ignores the compressed pack files. –

@Shahbaz - git (like mercurial and several other systems) is a
distributed vcs. A dvcs works on different principles than a traditional
vcs. See, for example, [this
tutorial](http://www.vogella.de/articles/Git/article.html). Non-text
files can definitely be tracked. When you clone a repository to start a
new branch of development, all files are copied. – [Ted

@TedHopp, the way I understand your answer is that you're saying that
git stores each revision of each file uncompressed. That's not true, see
my answer. – [svick](/users/41071/svick "72292 reputation") Nov 19 '11
