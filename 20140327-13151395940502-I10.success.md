Big Breakthroughs Come in Your Late 30s

James Murphy, the former frontman of the band LCD Soundsystem, made what
he called the [biggest mistake of his
life](http://arts.theguardian.com/fridayreview/story/0,,1337870,00.html)
at 21, when he turned down a writing job on a sitcom that was about to
launch.

The sitcom's name was *Seinfeld*.

Instead, he lurched around, working as a bouncer and later a DJ before
finally releasing the first LCD Soundsystem album at the not-so-tender
age of 35.

Murphy might have been older than some of his dance-rock peers, but his
experience is fairly common among people who experience major creative
breakthroughs, [according to a new paper from
NBER](http://www.nber.org/papers/w19866.pdf).

The authors examined the high points of the careers of both great
inventors and Nobel-Prize winning scientists, and they found that the
late 30s were the sweet spot for strokes of genius:

Innovators have been peaking slightly later in life as the 20th century
has progressed, in part because today's scientists [have more to
learn](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45198217/#.Uv5NhmRDvuc)than their
predecessors did:

![image](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/02/Screen_Shot_2014_02_14_at_12.40.10_PM/427f5025f.png)Jones/NBER

What's more, people who excel in abstract fields, like art or physics,
tend to be younger than those who win prizes in fields that require more
context, like history or medicine. Another 1977 study found that physics
Nobel winners were 36 on average when they did their prize-winning work,
while chemists were 39 and medical doctors were 41.

So why the late 30s? The most obvious factor is education: Scientists
spend ages 5 through 18 in school, and then ages 18 through 30ish
getting their academic degrees. Then a few years of learning on the job,
and presto! You dig up [an uncertainty
principle](http://news.discovery.com/history/youngest-nobel-prize-winners-131011.htm).
Meanwhile, scientific breakthroughs tend to be less common in old age
because we invest less in learning as we get older, and our skills
gradually become less relevant.

There's evidence from the humanities, though, that genius doesn't
decline with age at all. [Over 40 percent of
both](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/20/081020fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all)
Robert Frost's and William Carlos Williams' best poems were written
after the poets turned 50. Paul Cézanne's highest-priced paintings [were
made the year he
died](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.07/genius_pr.html).

The NBER paper found that scientists who are theoretical (coming up with
new ways of thinking) tend to peak earlier than those who are
experimental (coming up with answers based on existing knowledge) by
about 4.6 years.

This happens for two reasons: First, theoretical scientists don't
necessarily have to wait for a bunch of experiments to get completed and
published. Second, and perhaps more importantly, being relatively new to
their fields allows them to see the holes and fissures that veterans
might not.

Here's how the study's authors explain it:

> The most important conceptual work typically involve radical
> departures from existing paradigms, and the ability to identify and
> appreciate these radical departures may be greatest shortly after
> initial exposure to a paradigm, before it has been fully assimilated.

They quote Sigmund Freud in *Civilization and its Discontents* as
writing, “The conceptions I have summarized here I first put forward
only tentatively, \
 but in the course of time they have won such a hold over me that I can
no longer think in any other way.”

Genius, it seems, happens when a seasoned mind sees a problem with fresh
eyes.
