Using Browserify with Ruby on Rails
===================================

Working on a Ruby on Rails project I had a moment where I realized,
"Hey, I haven't used Browserify with Rails before, maybe I should try
that out!"

So I did.

I tried two gems:
[sprockets-browserify](https://github.com/janv/sprockets-browserify) and
[browserify-rails](https://github.com/hsume2/browserify-rails). I found
that neither worked when I installed them and followed the instructions
in their readmes.

But then I realized, "Wait, I shouldn't really need a gem for this."

So instead, I did this:

### Create a package.json file in the project root.

I created a bare-minimum package.json file:

    {
      "name": "project-name",
      "devDependencies": {},
      "dependencies": {}
    }

### Install browserify and watchify

I installed browserify and watchify as development dependencies:

    npm install --save-dev browserify watchify

### Set up npm scripts

I added a few npm scripts to the package.json file:

    "scripts": {
      "bundle": "browserify app/assets/javascripts/index.js -o app/assets/javascripts/bundle.js"
      "watch-js": "watchify app/assets/javascripts/index.js -o app/assets/javascripts/bundle.js",
      "start": "npm run watch-js & rails s"
    },

The bundle script creates a browserified js bundle.

The watch-js script watches index.js for changes and regenerates the
bundle.

The start script runs the watch-js script and also starts the rails
server.

### Rewrote the application.js file to only include the bundle.js file

In the `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` file I made it only
require the bundle generated by browserify/watchify:

    //= require bundle

### The package.json file should look something like this now:

    {
      "name": "project-name",
      "devDependencies": {
        "browserify": "^3.32.1",
        "watchify": "^0.6.2"
      },
      "scripts": {
        "bundle": "browserify app/assets/javascripts/index.js -o app/assets/javascripts/bundle.js"
        "watch-js": "watchify app/assets/javascripts/index.js -o app/assets/javascripts/bundle.js",
        "start": "npm run watch-js & rails s"
      },
    }

### Create an index.js file

Create a file named index.js at `app/assets/javascripts/index.js`. Use
it like you would any browserify project!

### Run npm start

Running `npm start` will start the watch-js script and rebuild the
bundle when you make changes, as well as start the rails development
server.
