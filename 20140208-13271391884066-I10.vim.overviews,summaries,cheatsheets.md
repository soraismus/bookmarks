If you are transitioning from windows, then in order of preference you
will probably want to use, **evim**, **gvim**, **vim**.\
 evim makes gvim behave like windows editors (note Ctrl+L gets you to
vim Normal mode). If one just wants the windows key mappings from evim
mode in gvim for e.g. you can use the following command: **source
$VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim**. Other alternatives if you're transitioning from
windows are **nedit** or **geany**.

If you're stuck with text mode access, then vim is probably the best
option, so you need this info (all of which also applies to gvim and
evim). Another reason that it is good to know this is that many programs
use vim key bindings. For e.g. the readline library can be configured to
use vi bindings and hence this info will be useful to you in bash,
ftp,gnuplot,python,bc,... Also less (used to read man pages on Linux)
defaults to vi key bindings.

Note most commands take an optional number (of times to run) on front\
 (e.g. 3**.** repeats the last action 3 times, or 3w moves forward 3
words etc.).

Here are my [vim settings](settings/.vimrc) and my [gvim
settings](settings/.gvimrc).

  ---------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Command**                        **Action**                                   **Notes**

  vim file +54                       open file and go to line 54                  any : command can be run using + on command line

  vim -O file1 file2                 open file1 and file2 side by side            

  Insert                             enter insert mode                            so you can start typing. Alternatively one can use **i** or **a**.

  Esc                                leave insert mode                            so you can issue commands. Note in VIM the cursor keys & {Home, End, Page{up,down}} and Delete and Backspace work as expected in any mode, so you don't need to go back to command mode nearly as much as the origonal vi. Note even Ctrl+{left,right} jumps words like most other editors. Note also Ctrl+[ and **Ctrl+c** are equivalent to Esc and may be easier to type. Also Ctrl+o in insert mode will switch to normal mode for one command only and automatically switch back.

  :command                           runs named command                           

  :help word                         shows help on word                           Typing Ctrl+d after word shows all entries containing word

  :echo &word                        shows value of word                          

  **windows**

  :e                                 set buffer for current window                you can optionally specify a new file or existing buffer number (\#3 for e.g.). Note if you specify a directory a file browser is started. E.g. :e **.** will start the browser in the current directory (which can be changed with the :cd command).

  :sp                                new window above                             ditto

  :vs                                new window to left                           ditto

  :q                                 close current window                         

  :qa                                close all windows                            add trailing ! to force

  Ctrl+w {left,right,up,down}        move to window                               

  Ctrl+w Ctrl+w                      toggle window focus                          

  Ctrl+w =                           autosize windows                             to new terminal size for e.g.

  :ba                                new window for all buffers                   ":vert ba" tiles windows vertically

  **buffers**

  :ls                                list buffers                                 

  gf                                 open file under cursor                       

  :bd                                delete buffer                                and any associated windows

  :w                                 save file                                    Note :up[date] only writes file if changes made, but it's more awkward to type

  :sav filename                      save file as filename                        Note :w filename doesn't switch to new file. Subsequent edits/saves happen to existing file

  **undo/redo**

  u                                  undo                                         

  Ctrl+r                             redo                                         

  .                                  repeat

  :make                              run make in current directory                

  Ctrl+]                             jump to tag                                  Ctrl+t to jump back levels. I map these to Alt+⇦⇨ in my [.vimrc](settings/.vimrc)

  vim -t name                        Start editing where name is defined          

  Ctrl+{n,p}                         scroll forward,back through\                 uses words in current file (and included files) by default. You can change to a dictionary for e.g:\

  Ctrl+x Ctrl+o                      scroll through\                              "Intellisense" for vim (7 & later).\
                                     language specific completions for\           :help compl-omni for more info.\
                                     text before cursor                           Useful for python, css, javascript, ctags, ...\
                                                                                  Note only works in insert mode

  **external filters**

  :%!filter                          put whole file through filter                

  :!filter                           put (visual) selection through filter        

  :,!command                         replace current line with command output     

  map <f9\> :w<CR\>:!python %<CR\>   run current file with external program
