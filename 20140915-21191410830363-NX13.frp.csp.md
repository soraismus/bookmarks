[Comparing core.async and Functional Reactive Programming (+Rx)](/questions/20632512/comparing-core-async-and-functional-reactive-programming-rx)

**17**

I seem to be a little bit confused when comparing Clojure's
**core.async** to the so called **Reactive Extensions** (Rx) and **FRP**
in general. They seem to tackle similar problem of async-hronicity, so I
wonder what are the principal differences and in what cases is one
preferred over the other. Can someone please explain?

EDIT: To encourage more in-depth answers I want to make the question
more specific:

1.  Core.async allows me to write synchronous-looking code. However as I
    understand it RFP only needs one level of nested callbacks (all the
    function that handle logic are passed as arguments to RFP API). This
    seems that both approaches make the callback *pyramids* unnecessary.
    It is true that in JS I have to write `function() {...}` many times,
    but the main problem, the *nested* callbacks, is gone in FRP also.
    Do I get it right?

2.  "[FRP] complects the communication of messages with flow of control"
    Can you (someone) please give a more specific explanation?

3.  Can't I pass around FRP's observable endpoints the same way as i
    pass channels?

In generel I understand where both approaches historically come from and
I have tried few tutorials in both of them. However I seem to be
"paralyzed" by the non-obviousness of differences. Is there some
**example of a code that would be hard to write in one of these and easy
using the other**? And what is the architectural reason of that?

That's not quite true, as it is quite possible, and encouraged for
things such as pub/sub, especially with a combineLatest when flattened.

[Clojure core.async is a port of go blocks from the Go
language](http://clojure.com/blog/2013/06/28/clojure-core-async-channels.html).
The fundamental concept is channels representing asynchronous
communication between threads.

The goal is to be able to write normal looking blocks of sequential code
that access channels to get input, and this is seamlessly translated
into a state machine that works out the
[CSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes)
translation for you.

Contrast to FRP, which is still fundamentally about callbacks, and it
complects the communication of messages with flow of control. core.async
eliminates callbacks from your code entirely, and separates control flow
from message transmission. Also, in FRP a channel is not a first class
object (ie. you cannot send an FRP channel as a value on an FRP
channel).

FRP is not fundamentally about callbacks. callbacks are simply a means
to a much higher-order ends. If it were just about callbacks, we'd call
it plain old reactive programming. – [Christopher

Agreed with @christopher-harris that it's not solely about callbacks, as
you can get nice compositional behavior without it such as
distinctUntilChanged, retry, sample, throttle, etc. There are many
operators which require no callback at all. It's more about chaining
than anything else. – [Matthew

I think main problem is your assumption about the tackled problem are
not quite so, since none of them are tackling the *asynchronicity*
"problem".

The abstractions
----------------

`FRP` main idea is propagation of change, think about accomplishing the
same thing Excel does, where you define cells depending on each other in
a *cascade*, and when one cell changes, all the dependent cells on the
cascade are recalculated.

`core.async` main idea is systems decomposition, think as separating
concerns using a `queue` in the middle of different processes, in
`core.async` case instead of queues you have channels but you get the
idea.

So, removing the *pyramidal code* is not the objective of either
technology, and they operate on different abstraction layers.

About complecting control flow
------------------------------

The idea about complecting communication and flow control is taken from
[the original core async
post](http://clojure.com/blog/2013/06/28/clojure-core-async-channels.html).

> While there are various mechanisms to make events/callbacks cleaner
> (FRP, Rx/Observables) they don't change their fundamental nature,
> which is that upon an event an arbitrary amount of other code is run,
> possibly on the same thread, leading to admonitions such as "don't do
> too much work in your handler", and phrases like "callback hell".

Rephrasing, if you have *business domain code* inside an event handler,
you have complected the **X event processing** with the **what to do
when X happens**.

Which is what `core.async` tackles, since introducing a *queue/channel*
in the middle, helps for a better separation of concerns.

Implementation
--------------

All your questions regarding callbacks and passing observable endpoints
as parameters are just implementation questions, it really depends on
the `Rx` implementation and API.

If you look at [React reusable
components](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html)
you really don't have much of a callback hell to be seen, and you get
that idea of passing observables around.

Final thoughts
--------------

Even if `Rx` can be used to model any data flow, is more commonly used
for *UI Rendering* a-la Excel, to simplify how you update your view when
your model changes.

On the other hand, `Core.Async` can be used to model separation of
concerns when any two sub-systems communicate with each other (same
usage scenario as queues), using it on the UI rendering chain main idea
is to separate:

-   Server side event generation and processing
-   How that event affects your model

So you can have `core.async` and `FRP` together, since `core.async` will
separate concerns, and `FRP` will define your cascading data-flow once
your model is updated.

At least one of the main principal differences, and, I think, what Rich
ment by "[FRP] complects the communication of messages with flow of
control", is the following.

Callbacks are code that is executed. And that execution has to happen in
some thread at some point in time. Often, the time is when the event
happens, and the thread is the thread that notices/produces the event.
If the producer instead put a message on a channel, you are free to
consume the message when you want, in whatever thread you want. So
callbacks, which are essentially a form of communication, complect the
communication with flow of control by dictating when and where the
callback code is being executed. If you have to use callbacks for
whatever reason, just use them to put a message on a queue/channel and
you are back on track.

Because core.async is less complex, it should be preferred as long as
there is not a good reason to use the alternatives.

EDIT:

To answer your questions:

1.  Yes, many times, callbacks can be eliminated, for example with retry
    logic, distinctUntilChanged and lots of other things such as:

    var obs = getJSON('story.json').retry(3);

    var obs = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document,
    'keyup').distinctUntilChanged();

2.  I'm not sure what that refers to with making it more complex with
    flow control.

3.  Yes, you can pass around an object like you would a channel, as with
    the below object.

For example, you can have channel like behavior here using RxJS with a
[ReplaySubject](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/subjects/replaysubject.md):

    var channel = new Rx.ReplaySubject();

    // Send three observables down the chain to subscribe to
    channel.onNext(Rx.Observable.timer(0, 250).map(function () { return 1; }));
    channel.onNext(Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000).map(function () { return 2; }));
    channel.onNext(Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1500).map(function () { return 3; }));

    // Now pass the channel around anywhere!
    processChannel(channel);

To make it a little bit more concrete, compare the code from David
Nolen's post
[here](http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/12/communicating-sequential-processes/)
with an RxJS FRP example
[here](http://jsfiddle.net/mattpodwysocki/TZ33E/4/)
