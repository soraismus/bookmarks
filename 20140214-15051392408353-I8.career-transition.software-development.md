    ===================================================================================================================================================================================================================

    I talk to founders, CTOs, CEOs and hiring managers of startups
    often. I host and go to quite a few social events monthly that they
    gather at, besides them being a large part of my friend group. While
    they are all amazingly brilliant and I gather much wisdom by
    osmosis; one thing I hear quite often from all of them what a
    difficult time they have finding and hiring developers. I end up
    saying the following to them, and I thought it was a good thing to
    share with everyone. Hiring developers doesn’t have to be hard.
    While they are in demand, good employers are increasingly rare, and
    if you genuinely care about finding your developers and keeping them
    happy it will be easy to set yourself apart.

    A lot of the points of this post originate from the book Smart and
    Gets Things Done by Joel Spolsky. If you can, just read that book.
    It’s full of wisdom about hiring that is much more than “how to get
    a developer to work for you”. I hope to cover some of those topics
    myself, but in all honesty you should just read that book. In case
    you don’t, however, you can start with this post.

    **THEY ARE NOT GOING TO COME TO YOU**

    I have posted several job posts when hiring developers, I have never
    hired a developer through a job post. The developers you want to
    hire are never applying to job listings. The are either gainfully
    employed, or directly contacting you because they have found your
    company and love what you do. This field is so saturated right now
    that the good developers can pick and choose the companies they want
    to work for.

    So, how do you find them? Resumes are meaningless. If you gave me a
    pile of resumes, and told me I had to hire one of the developers in
    the pile, the first thing I would do is schedule a party and invite
    all the developers on that list. This is what you need to do. Either
    go places where there are many developers and meet them, or create
    your own event and invite developers. That doesn’t mean doing a
    speaking series, either; ideally you can be more creative than to
    sit butts in seats and have someone talk about caching. At Levo
    League we had (and we still have) the developer potluck, which was a
    monthly event where we all drank wine, ate each other’s food, and
    discussed thigns that were important to us. Find a way to promote
    developer fellowship and then they will come. You can also go to
    them. Meetup.com has a plethora of events you can go to. I recommend
    targeting hack nights and other situations where, rather than
    sitting in an audience listening, you are chatting and getting to
    know each other.

    Don’t be turned off if a developer that you want to hire already has
    a job. Chances are their company will not be focused on the points
    below and they are not 100% happy. Keeping your developers happy is
    the job of every good manager. If they aren’t happy they aren’t
    working with the right people. If they are happy keep in touch,
    chances are they may be looking for something in a while given the
    short tenure of this industry and the volatility of most companies.
    (read: I will straight up gank one of your developers, watch out).

    **CARE ABOUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO THEM**

    Often I have heard people say things like “this job would make any
    developer a huge deal in X industry”. Developers don’t want to be
    huge in the fashion or artisan food industry, generally they’d
    rather be huge in the developer industry, and your app that is the
    foursquare of trunk clubs is not going to get them there.

    Developers like solving problems, they are basically technical
    detectives. What is the interesting problem that developers get to
    solve with your company? This can be hard if you’re not a dev
    yourself, so, in that case, think about what’s unique for a
    developer at your company. Will they be building a team? Will they
    have a high salary comparatively to other developers? Will they have
    the chance to work with brilliant people? Will they be working out
    of an amazing space?

    Moreso, find out what is important to them besides coding and perks.
    Do they have a family? Find a way for them to bring their kids in a
    few times a week, or have a family meal on Fridays. Do they like to
    travel? Invent a travel bonus, where they get to go where they want
    one week every three months. Do they want to speak at conferences?
    Become their agent, allow them time to commit to open source.

    Actually care about these things and don’t pretend. Your developers
    will be working with you more than they do anything else in life,
    more than they sleep, more than they are with their kids, it’s your
    job to ensure they are brilliantly happy doing it.

    **HAVE CLEAR INCENTIVES**

    If your developers work for 70 hours a week, if they don’t have a
    say in product, if they have to be in at 8am, if they have to wear a
    suit, or any other arbitrary thing that doesn’t matter in the end:
    you’re going to end up with a bad team.

    Why a bad team? Developers are getting the full court press every
    day, what they do is valuable. If they have to pick a company that
    forces them to be uncomfortable it means other companies aren’t
    hiring them.

    Stupid perks like a keg and a ping pong table don’t make up for
    making them follow rote ritual. It’s time to give up your dad’s
    version of how business is done, and recognize that this is just a
    different culture.

    **KNOW HOW THE DOUGHNUTS ARE MADE**

    Here is something that boggles my mind, I don’t know how it’s
    possible that so many people with web startups have no idea how the
    internet works? If I were to open a shoe factory, I would learn all
    about making shoes. I would make a few shoes of my own. I would make
    sure that I knew everything that goes into making a shoe. Especially
    if I need to hire shoemakers, how else would I know if they are any
    good?

    Developers can smell a non-technical founder from miles away. It
    tells them that you have zero respect for what they do, and you
    think they are just tools. The Twitter book by Nick Bilton mentioned
    few developers. Somehow that company was built with a few
    developers. Your developers don’t want that to happen to them, and
    if you don’t care enough about what your company produces to learn
    how it works that’s the message you’re sending.

    **INVEST EARLY**

    Show them that they are important to you. Offer them what they are
    worth, don’t negotiate to death. Sure, if you haggle you can pay
    them 10k less, but guess what, tomorrow they are going to get an
    offer fro 20k more and they will remember the hard line you drew.

    Take them to nice dinners, or, spend a whole afternoon with them
    doing something they enjoy. Walk in the park, go to a movie, meet
    their spouse, take the spouse with you. Show them that they, and the
    people that are important to them are important to you.

    The $200 you save now from avoiding all this wont be worth the 10k
    you lose because you ended up with a terrible developer.

    **I NEVER SAID THIS WAS EASY**

    If you are at this point and thinking “wow, all this is too much”
    then you are in the wrong line of work. Coding is a skill that is
    maybe the most in demand in the world, it’s unreasonable to think
    it’s not going to take some sacrifices to attract the people that
    are talented.

    If you have any questions, feel free to drop me a line.
