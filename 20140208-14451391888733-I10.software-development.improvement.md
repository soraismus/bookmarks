10 ways to improve your programming skills
==========================================

\
 **1. Learn a new programming language**\
 \
 Learning the new programming language will develop new ways of
thinking, especially if the new language uses a paradigm that you do not
know yet. Many of the acquired ways of thinking could be applied to the
languages that are already known. Perhaps, you might even like the new
programming language, and you will start using it for new serious
projects.\
 \
 Here are some good languages that give the great educational experience
and cognitive effect:
[Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29)
([Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29)
is
good),[Forth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_%28programming_language%29),
[PostScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript)
or[Factor](http://factorcode.org/) ([stack-oriented programming
languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming_language.)),
J (wonderful[array programming
language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming)),[Haskell](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell)
([strongly typed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_typing)
purely[functional programming
language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)),[Prolog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog)
([logic programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming))
and[Erlang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29)
([concurrent
programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing)
goodness).\
 \
 **2. Read a good programming book**\
 \
 A lot of knowledge could be found in the books. Undoubtedly, a practice
is also important, but reading one challenging programming book might
help you to challenge your thinking and to enrich your knowledge. Here
is a list of such challenging books: [The Art of Computer
Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Computer-Programming-Volumes-Boxed/dp/0201485419)
(if you want a real challenge),[Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs](http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)
(SICP),[A Discipline of
Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Discipline-Programming-Edsger-W-Dijkstra/dp/013215871X)
or the famous[dragon
book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321486811/).\
 Of course, you can read less complicated books as well, but you try to
go around books such as “For Dummies” that promise to teach you in 24
hours or 3 weeks. These books will not do any good for you in terms of
improving programming skills.\
 \
 **3. Join an open source project**\
 \
 What are the benefits to join an open source project? It is a team work
(a good thing if before you worked on personal projects), in addition
you will get the opportunity to work with somebody else’s code into,
understanding it (that may be challenging for you).\
 Here are some well-known websites of the open-source code developers:
[GitHub](https://github.com/),
[Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/),[gitorious](http://gitorious.org/),[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
or [Ohloh](http://www.ohloh.net/).\
 \
 **4. Solve programming puzzles**\
 \
 Solve programming puzzles is also very good method to develop yourself.
For example, math oriented problems can be found at [Project
Euler](http://projecteuler.net/), which is one of the most popular
websites for coding puzzles. I recommend trying out [The Python
Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/), as well a code golf
programming puzzle where programmers try to solve a programming problem
with the least amount of keystrokes. It can teach you many of the more
esoteric and special features of the language, making your work creative
and productive.\
 \
 **5. Program**\
 \
 You start making every new program "from scratch". Develop yourself all
the architecture and implement it. Repeat it. Programming is the best
way to learn the programming. You will learn from your own mistakes, and
at the end of the project will get a lot more fun than reading a book.
In addition, you will master it and you will understand all things that
you did not before.\
 \
 **6. Read and study the code**\
 \
 Study interesting codes such as [Linux](http://www.kernel.org/) kernel
(be aware, it is huge code). [MINIX3](http://minix3.org/) is a good
operating system for educational purposes. You can learn many new
language idioms and the software architecture. Reading unfamiliar source
code is difficult work at first, but rewarding afterwards.\
 \
 **7. Visiting the programming websites and blogs**\
 \
 You should visit and read the websites and forums about programming,
you will show yourself and learn from others. In addition, it is very
educational to read blogs as well. I can advise you the [Joel on
Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/), [Coding
Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/), [Lambda the
Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/),
[StackOverFlow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and
[Umumble.com](http://umumble.com/).\
 \
 **8. Write about programming**\
 \
 You should get your own blog about programming and write in it, even if
it is for yourself. Browse sites such as Q & A and try to give answers.
So you can get the some knowledge about the specific subject. If you
feel confident, write tutorials. If you write about programming, you
want to make sure that use the correct terminology and know who to
explain problems and techniques.\
 \
 **9. Learn low-level programming**\
 \
 Learning low-level programming is useful for better understanding of
the underlying machine. Read about
[C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), and maybe
even learn the
[assembler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language). In
addition, you have to learn how a computer runs a program and how an
operating system works (at a high-level, at least). If you really want
to learn the low-level programming, you should read books about computer
organization, operating systems, embedded systems, operating system
driver development and so on.\
 \
 **10. Doesn’t work? Don’t rush to get help. Think yourself!**\
 \
 So, you have a problem with your code, it does not work or it works,
but not properly. You want to solve it as fast as it possible. What do
you do? You rush to the forum or write your friend. You don’t ever do
it. It is better to spend some time trying to solve the problem on your
own, instead. Take a paper and a pencil, start sketching the work of
algorithm and check it against the code. If that doesn’t work, take a
short break to keep your mind fresh and then try again. If after
spending an hour or two (it is depending on the size of the problem) of
trying to solve this piece of code, it does not work, you go and check
out Google, searching this solution. If you still cannot do it, so be
it, you may ask for some help. In any case, you tried hard to solve the
problem using your brains. You have spent some time, but you have gotten
additional skills.
