**1) What is the Common Core?**

The [Common Core State Standards
Initiative](http://www.corestandards.org) is the largest-ever attempt in
the United States to set unified expectations for what students in
kindergarten through 12th grade should know and be able to do in each
grade in preparation for college and the workforce. In short, the
standards are meant to get every student in America on the same page.
Right now, the Common Core standards cover two areas: math and English
language arts (writing and reading). They were developed by a group of
governors, chief state school officers and education experts from 48
states. To date, 44 states and the District of Columbia have formally
adopted the new standards. By Spring of 2015, most of these states plan
to administer state tests that have been aligned to the new standards.

It's complicated! Louis C.K. is [not the first parent to take to the
Internet](http://hechingerreport.org/content/common-core-math-problem-hard-supporters-common-core-respond-problematic-math-quiz-went-viral_15361/)blaming

Here's the thing: The Common Core standards don't specify the use of
curricula, textbooks, workbooks or lesson plans — let alone particular
math problems. ([See \#6, below](#q6)). But in order to teach to the new
standards, schools are rushing to adopt new materials labeled "Common
Core-aligned." The creation of new materials, the repackaging of old
materials, and the training of teachers to teach to the new standards
within a few short years are all causing adjustment issues.

For example, one "viral" math problem piled on interpretations of four
different Common Core second-grade math standards: number lines, place
values, adding and subtracting up to 1,000, and the ability to explain
in words how one arrives at an answer. Jason Zimba, one of the lead
writers of the math standards, [told the Hechinger
Report](http://hechingerreport.org/content/common-core-math-problem-hard-supporters-common-core-respond-problematic-math-quiz-went-viral_15361):
"That question would not be in a textbook if I wrote it."

What many parents will notice if they have a child taking math in a
Common Core state is that kids are being asked to perform the same old
equations — but they're being taught new ways of arriving at the old
answers. There's a new emphasis on breaking down numbers into their
component parts so that kids better understand what it means to add,
subtract, multiply and divide. Also new: a shift toward [visualizing
math concepts with drawings and
diagrams](http://www.vox.com/2014/4/20/5625086/the-common-core-makes-simple-math-more-complicated-heres-why).

**3) Why do we need the Common Core?**

Several arguments have been made in favor of creating a single set of
expectations for what students should know and be able to do.

-   No Child Left Behind, a federal law, mandated that all states give
    annual tests in grades 3-12 to ensure that all students were
    proficient. However, each state chose its own test and its own
    definition of proficiency. So, in practice, the numbers couldn't
    really be compared from state to state. In theory, with the Common
    Core come common definitions of proficiency for each grade, allowing
    for clearer comparisons of how kids are doing from state to state
    and school to school.
-   Those previous, state-specific standards — in lots of cases — were
    also not as rigorous as the Common Core. So adoption of the core
    standards, in many states, means a rise in quality ([also see
    \#8](#q8)).
-   In the past, private companies created textbooks, materials and
    tests to satisfy requirements for 50 different states. A common,
    agreed-upon set of standards enables a single marketplace of
    materials, which should lead to more competition.
-   Other countries with high-performing students also use a single set
    of national standards ([See \#9](#q9)).
-   A single set of standards, including sequencing from grade to grade,
    should make it easier for students to catch up when they switch
    schools or move to a new state. This is one of the reasons the U.S.
    military supports the standards — [children connected with the
    military move
    frequently](http://www.militarychild.org/k-12-core-curriculum-standards).

* * * * *

**4) Where did the Common Core come from?**

The major groups involved in developing the standards include a
nonprofit called [Achieve](http://www.achieve.org/), which was founded
by a group of business leaders and governors in 1996 (long before Common
Core). Among its contributors are many of America's largest
corporations, such as Alcoa, Exxon Mobil and Microsoft, as well as many
large foundations, like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (also a
funder of NPR Ed), and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

In 2009, Achieve partnered with the[National Governors
Association](http://www.nga.org/cms/home.html) and the [Council of Chief
State School Officers](http://www.ccsso.org/)to begin developing the
standards. They were initially released in 2010, and most states began
the process of adopting them that year.

and aligned assessments

Core](/news/graphics/2014/05/gr-commoncore-family-tree-624.png)

A nonprofit called [Student Achievement
Partners](http://achievethecore.org/about-us) was founded in 2007 to
write the standards. Co-founders David Coleman, Sue Pimentel and Jason
Zimba all became lead writers of Common Core. Coleman had previously
sold an education startup to textbook company McGraw-Hill. He went on to
become president of the College Board, which makes the SATs. Pimentel is
a curriculum and assessment specialist, and Zimba has a Ph.D. in
mathematical physics.

The National Education Association (NEA), American Federation of
Teachers (AFT), National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), and
National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) all assembled teachers to
give feedback and input on the standards. The
[NEA](http://www.nea.org/home/56614.htm) and the
[AFT](http://www.aft.org/issues/standards/nationalstandards/), the two
largest teachers' unions in the country, both initially published
statements of support for the standards. So have [several
groups](http://www.corestandards.org/other-resources/statements-of-support/)
representing principals, school board officers, teachers, school boards,
the military and the national PTA, among others.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the largest philanthropic
funds in the world, has made the development and adoption of the Common
Core standards [a key strategy in its education
programs](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/US-Program/College-Ready-Education#OurStrategy)
and has contributed [at least $170
million](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/05/12/gates-gives-150-million-in-grants-for-common-core-standards/)
to various groups [to further that
goal](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/11/27/gates-foundation-pours-millions-into-common-core-in-2013/).

**5) What was the federal government's role in creating the Common
Core?**

This is probably the biggest single source of controversy surrounding
the Common Core. The truth is, the federal government played no role in
creating the standards, nor did it require that states adopt them. But
the U.S. Department of Education under President Obama and Secretary of
Education Arne Duncan did incentivize adoption.

In July 2009, the Education Department created Race to the Top, a $3.4
billion grant competition. States that agreed to adopt the Common Core
standards won points on their applications, increasing their eligibility
for a share of the money. This carrot, with a deadline attached, helped
spur a majority of states to adopt the standards within a few months
after they were released in July 2010. The federal government also
funded the state-led consortia creating[the Common Core-aligned
tests.](#q13)

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**6) What do "standards" mean? Are they the same as curricula?**

No. Standards set goals for what students should know and be able to do.
For example, the first goal for kindergarten math in Common Core is to
"count to 100 by ones and by tens."

A curriculum describes in much more detail how students and teachers
should interact with specific content, in a specific sequence, over the
course of a year in order to achieve a set of goals. Curricula may be
adopted at the state level or by local school boards. Supporting
materials such as texts, workbooks, computer programs and tests are
produced by commercial vendors and nonprofits, and districts, states and
sometimes individual teachers purchase them.

Working from a curriculum and associated materials, a teacher then
creates individual lesson plans with learning goals and activities for
each year, semester, unit, week, day, hour and even minute in the
classroom.

To give an idea of scope and the level of detail, the Common Core
standards for K-12 English language arts and K-12 math are each about
60-70 pages long. The curriculum in California public schools, which
includes Common Core standards, is [79 pages for kindergarten
alone](http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/documents/glckindercurriculum.pdf)
(PDF).

For the goal mentioned above, the California public school curriculum
elaborates: "Kindergarteners learn the number names as they count (to
100 by 1s and 10s) and write number names (from 0 to 20). Students learn
that each successive number name refers to a quantity that is one larger
as they count objects and say the corresponding number names. ... To
help develop their writing skills, students may copy a numeral many
times, then write the numeral with some prompts (e.g., dots or arrows),
and finally write it from memory as the teacher says the number. A
multisensory approach is important at this age and students may need to
be encouraged to be unconcerned about the quality of their handwriting
as they learn to write numerals."

**7) What are the standards replacing?**

Every state previously set its own education standards. This gets back
to [\#3](#q3),[](#q3)perhaps the biggest reason education and business
leaders wanted the Common Core standards. Under No Child Left Behind,
states were held accountable for student proficiency, but they were also
allowed to set their own bar for what "proficiency" meant. And many
intentionally lowered the bar to avoid repercussions under NCLB. [As a
result](http://www.npr.org/2013/07/05/198442307/education-reform-learns-lesson-from-old-standards),
a B+ reader in one low-performing state could move with his parents to a
high-performing state and find himself far behind (for more on this
issue, [jump to \#8](#q8)).

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**8) Are the Common Core standards harder than my state's old
standards?**

That's a matter of controversy. The initiative states on its website,
"Since this work began, there has been an explicit agreement that no
state would lower its standards." A [2010 review by the Fordham
Institute](http://www.edexcellence.net/publications/the-state-of-state-of-standards-and-the-common-core-in-2010.html),
which supports the Common Core, found that California, Indiana and the
District of Columbia had standards that were clearly superior to Common
Core. Massachusetts, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Florida,
Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and Arizona had standards that were
"too close to call" in terms of quality comparison to Common Core. In
the remaining 33 states, the Common Core standards were "clearly
superior" to state standards in both math and English.

The quality of standards is not the only determinant of educational
progress, of course.

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**9) Do other countries do this?**

Some do, but by no means all. The United States is unusual in its degree
of local control over public schools. In many developed nations there
are national educational standards and even national curricula
([U.K.](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum)
and
[France](http://www.education.gouv.fr/pid24306/l-ecole-elementaire-en-pratique.html)).
In others, such as Canada and Australia, standards and curricula are
adopted on a provincial or statewide basis, but most of these countries
have fewer political divisions than our 50 states, so in practice there
is a higher degree of coordination than in the U.S.

The [PISA exam](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/), given in 65 countries, is
the most frequently cited comparative measure of international
educational performance.

The top 10 performers on the 2012 exam, which covered mathematics,
included Singapore, Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein and the Netherlands, all
of which have national standards (although Singapore is a city-state and
Liechtenstein has just 37,000 residents).

Among the top 10 are four Chinese localities: Shanghai, Hong Kong,
Taipei and Macau. Each has a political relationship to China, but each
has its own, acclaimed math standards.

[Switzerland is another
counterexample](http://www.swissworld.org/en/education/general_overview/the_swiss_education_system/)
of a high-performing school system (\#9 on the 2012 PISA exams) that is
under a high degree of local control. There isn't even a federal
minister of education.

Achieve Inc. has issued briefs [comparing the Common Core standards with
widely admired international
standards](http://www.achieve.org/CCSS-comparison-briefs): Japan's and
Singapore's mathematics standards and the English language arts
standards of Alberta, Canada, and New South Wales, Australia.

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**10) What do the standards mean for math?**

The slogan of the Common Core is "fewer, higher, deeper" — a smaller
number of more rigorous standards with a focus on both understanding and
application. In math, the standards are designed to be coherent and
connected in a consistent sequence, with concepts that build on each
other from grade to grade ([here's a huge, complicated diagram showing
how](http://achievethecore.org/page/844/ccssm-wiring-diagram)). Grades
K-2 cover addition and subtraction; 3-5 cover multiplication, division
and fractions; 6-8 cover ratios, proportions and algebraic concepts.

The standards set a floor, not a ceiling. The Common Core sequence does
not completely tackle algebra until high school, and the standards don't
fully prepare students to take calculus even in college (a common
criticism of the Common Core math standards). In 2009, the most recent
year for which statistics were available, [15.9 percent of high school
graduates](http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_179.asp)
had already taken calculus.

"The mathematics in the Common Core — easily three years of mathematics
[in high school] reaching the level of Algebra II — will not by itself
prepare students for STEM majors or meet admissions criteria for top
universities," lead math standards writer [Jason Zimba has
written](http://www.edexcellence.net/commentary/education-gadfly-daily/common-core-watch/2013/what-i-learned-about-the-common-core-state-standards-when-i-testified-in-indiana.html).

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**11) What do the standards mean for English?**

In English, as in math, the slogan of the Common Core is "fewer, higher,
deeper" — a smaller number of more rigorous standards with a focus on
both understanding and application. In [English language
arts](http://www.npr.org/2014/04/09/297899409/common-core-literary-standards-require-close-reading),
the standards emphasize using evidence from texts in writing, and
answering text-dependent questions in reading.

Students are expected to be fluent in argumentative, explanatory and
narrative writing. For example, rather than being asked to write an
essay based purely on personal experience, like the classic "What I Did
on My Summer Vacation," a third-grader might be asked to write a paper
arguing that school should not be held year-round, giving reasons for
their opinion that summer vacation is good for children.

The biggest difference between a Common Core English classroom and
English classes of old may be a shift toward nonfiction and
informational texts at increasing levels of complexity. This leads to a
greater emphasis on reading and writing across subjects, and on
"academic" and technical vocabulary. In grades K-5, the standards
specify a 50-50 mix of literature, such as poetry and short stories,
with nonfiction texts covering subjects like science, history and social
studies. In grades 6-12, even within the literature category, more of
the reading will be "literary nonfiction," including journalism and
essays.

The Common Core English language arts standards don't include a reading
list or canon. The only author they specify is Shakespeare, alongside
foundational American history texts and literary "classics." But they do
offer a list of suggested "exemplar texts" — including books like
*Charlotte's Web* in 2nd grade, *Little Women* and *Narrative of the
Life of Frederick Douglass* in middle school, and *Jane Eyre* and
*Walden* in 11th grade ([see also \#22](#q22)).

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**12) What's an "informational text"?**

The Common Core emphasizes literacy in science and social studies, not
just in English class. Students may be asked to read a scientific paper,
the Constitution, or even a map.

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**13) How are Common Core standards affecting state tests?**

With the new standards come new tests. No Child Left Behind requires
statewide accountability tests be given to 3rd- through 12th-graders
annually. The federal government funded two multistate consortia,
[PARCC](https://www.parcconline.org/about-parcc) and [Smarter
Balanced](http://www.smarterbalanced.org/), to the tune of $350 million,
to create new Common Core-aligned tests for math and English language
arts. These were
["field-tested"](http://www.npr.org/2014/03/18/291172134/as-common-core-tests-approach-so-does-a-sea-change-in-schools)
by around 4 million students in the spring of 2014 in preparation for
release in the spring of 2015. Field-testing means testing the tests,
not testing the kids.

In addition, Pearson Education, the largest education publisher,
produced Common Core-aligned tests that were given for the first time in
2012 to [students in
Kentucky](http://education.ky.gov/aa/distsupp/pages/k-prep.aspx), and in
2013 to kids in New York state.

PARCC and Smarter Balanced tests will be administered by computer. This
means results are available more quickly. It also allows for the
inclusion of more items that [go beyond the standard multiple
choice](http://www.npr.org/2014/04/09/299073572/an-education-reporter-puts-himself-to-the-standardized-test),
such as placing statements in the order of their importance in a
passage.

Smarter Balanced tests will also be "[computer
adaptive](http://www.smarterbalanced.org/smarter-balanced-assessments/computer-adaptive-testing/),"
meaning the exact combination of questions varies based on students'
responses. This is supposed to allow the test to give a more precise
idea of each student's strengths and weaknesses.

As with many other aspects of the Common Core, the transition to the new
tests is creating a lot of confusion and resistance. Some schools [don't
have the necessary computer equipment or connectivity, for
example](http://stateimpact.npr.org/ohio/2013/03/21/rural-schools-struggle-to-prepare-for-common-cores-online-tests/).

In other districts, teachers are starting to teach the standards while
still administering old state tests, or giving the old and new tests at
the same time. California is one state that asked for and received [a
waiver from
"double-testing"](http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2014/03/california_wins_prized_double-.html)
its students.

To date, 10 states have pulled out of their original assessment
consortia (some were members of both): Utah, Oklahoma, Georgia, Alabama,
Indiana, Kansas, Pennsylvania, Alaska, Florida and Kentucky.

**14) What is the "assessment cliff"?**

The new Common Core tests are harder, and they are unfamiliar. That adds
up to a steep drop in scores. In Kentucky and New York, which gave
Common Core-aligned tests for the first time in 2012 and 2013
respectively, the percentage of students who met the "proficient" cutoff
[dropped by 25-30 percentage
points](http://stateimpact.npr.org/florida/2013/10/21/the-commonwealth-of-common-core-what-florida-can-learn-from-kentucky/).

State accountability tests are linked to consequences for students,
teachers, schools, districts and states. So a sharp drop in scores is
bound to be unpopular.

**16) Who is for the Common Core standards? Who is against them?**

As implementation progresses, the standards have stirred [more and more
controversy](http://www.npr.org/2014/04/04/299046883/common-core-turns-business-leaders-against-oklahoma-gop).
Much, though not all, of the most organized opposition comes from
conservative groups wary of a growing federal role in education. In
April 2013, the Republican National Committee [adopted a
resolution](https://www.gop.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013_Spring-Meeting_Resolutions.pdf)
(PDF) calling the Common Core "an inappropriate overreach to standardize
and control the education of our children." Then again, the standards
enjoy strong support from business leaders and a pair of high-profile
conservative backers: former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Arkansas
Gov. Mike Huckabee (PDF).

The Eagle Forum [has called the Common
Core](http://townhall.com/columnists/phyllisschlafly/2013/05/14/backlash-against-common-core-n1593981/page/full)
"federal ... control by Obama administration left-wing bureaucrats."

In February 2014, the head of the National Education Association, the
nation's largest teachers union, [called for a "course
correction"](http://www.npr.org/2014/02/26/283066724/teachers-unions-mobilize-to-delay-the-common-core)
on Common Core. The union didn't reject the use of the standards, but
said, "The implementation has been completely botched. Seven of ten
teachers believe that implementation of the standards is going poorly in
their schools."

This was significant because the NEA had initially endorsed the
standards and helped develop them.

In many states — including
[Alaska](http://stopalaskacommoncore.com/tag/alaskans-against-common-core/),
[Arkansas](http://www.arkansasagainstcommoncore.com),
[Arizona](http://www.arizonansagainstcommoncore.com/fliers.html),
[California](http://cuacc.org),
[Indiana](http://hoosiersagainstcommoncore.com),
[Missouri](http://www.moagainstcommoncore.com),
[Ohio](http://ohioansagainstcommoncore.com),
[Pennsylvania](http://nopacommoncore.com) and
[Utah](http://www.utahnsagainstcommoncore.com) — parents, teachers and
activists have created groups "against the Common Core."

And a Republican lawmaker in Florida [has
stated](http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2014/05/21/3440007/van-zant-common-core-response/)that
the Common Core will "attract every one of your children to become as
homosexual as they possibly can."

On the other side, besides the endorsers named above and many
influential education reformers, the Common Core standards are backed
strongly by the federal Department of Education. Secretary Arne Duncan
[got in
trouble](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=246201831)
in 2013 for characterizing the opposition to Common Core as "white
suburban moms."

ALEC, a political group made up of large corporations, endorses the
standards. One of its members, Exxon Mobil, has conducted its own
high-profile [public relations campaign](http://letssolvethis.com).

###### [Back to top](#top)

**17) What happened in Indiana?**

In March 2014, [Indiana dropped the Common
Core](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/03/24/293894857/indiana-becomes-first-state-to-back-out-of-common-core).

Of the 45 states that initially adopted the standards, Indiana became
the first (and only) state to officially repeal them. [Hoosiers Against
the Common Core](http://hoosiersagainstcommoncore.com) and other groups
had raised a series of objections about the cost of implementing the
standards and the implied degree of centralized control over schools and
teachers.

"I believe when we reach the end of this process there are going to be
many other states around the country that will take a hard look at the
way Indiana has taken a step back, designed our own standards and done
it in a way where we drew on educators, we drew on citizens, we drew on
parents and developed standards that meet the needs of our people," said
[Gov. Mike
Pence](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/indiana-withdrawing-common-core-standards/)
on signing the legislation that said Indiana would write its own
standards.

The story doesn't end there. Now that Indiana has written new standards
to replace the Common Core, backers and critics alike [don't see much
difference](http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/state_edwatch/2014/04/experts_pick_apart_indiana_standards_set_to_replace_common_core.html)
([also see \#19](#q19)).

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**18) Haven't lots of other states dropped Common Core?**

Not yet. Oklahoma's House [passed a
law](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/common-core/)against the standards,
but [its Senate still has to weigh
in](http://www.npr.org/2014/04/04/299046883/common-core-turns-business-leaders-against-oklahoma-gop).

Republican Govs. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana,
and Sam Brownback of Kansas have all spoken out against the standards —
but they are still being implemented in all three states. Alaska, Texas,
Nebraska and Virginia never adopted the standards, and Minnesota adopted
them in English language arts only, keeping its own standards in math.
Some other states have pulled out of the assessment consortia and plan
to use their own tests, which in practice will probably be produced by
companies like Pearson.

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**19) Is Common Core by any other name still Common Core?**

Probably. Even states that are publicly distancing themselves from the
Common Core and its assessments are often patterning their new standards
closely on it, rather than invest the time and money required to start
from scratch.

For example, Gov. Mike Pence invited a committee of independent experts,
led by Common Core critic Sandra Stotsky, to review a draft of Indiana's
new standards. [She reported in April
2014](http://www.uaedreform.org/downloads/2014/04/report-to-governor-pence.pdf)
(PDF) that "93% of the standards in grades 6-12 ... were identical to or
slightly edited versions of Common Core's standards in grades 6-12 ...
K-5 was ... also heavily repetitious of Common Core's standards."

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**20) What is the difference between "Common Core" and "Common
Core-aligned"?**

It's a big difference. The writers of the Common Core do not publish,
review or endorse any curricula, textbooks or other materials. That
means that anyone who produces an educational product can claim that it
is "Common Core-aligned." [And hundreds
do](https://www.edsurge.com/common-core-aligned).

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**21) Who is making money off of Common Core?**

Potentially lots of people. The size of the[K-12 instructional materials
marke](http://gsvadvisors.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/GSV-EDU-Factbook-Apr-13-2012.pdf)t
in the U.S. was estimated at $20 billion in 2012 (PDF). By comparison,
the size of the [trade publishing
market](http://www.marketsize.com/blog/index.php/category/publishing/)
was $6.53 billion in 2012. According to a survey last year, [68 percent
of school
districts](http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/12/11/14report-b1.h33.html?r=698686597&preview=1)
planned to purchase new materials aligned with Common Core.

The transition to Common Core coincides with the ongoing transition to
digital educational materials like apps and e-books. That means that
it's not just the traditional textbook publishers and test makers, like
Pearson and CTB/McGraw-Hill, that are lining up to create Common
Core-stamped products. It's also big technology companies like Apple and
startups like Amplify — a brand owned by News Corp. that [produces a
tablet designed for classroom
use](http://www.npr.org/2013/03/08/173766828/news-corp-education-tablet-for-the-love-of-learning)
and a multimedia Common Core-aligned curriculum.

Other potential profit centers from the Common Core will be in
professional development for teachers to prepare them to teach the
standards, and extra tutoring and test prep for students to help them
learn the more rigorous standards and pass the new, harder tests.
Parents already spend [an estimated $11
billion](http://gsvadvisors.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/GSV-EDU-Factbook-Apr-13-2012.pdf)
(PDF) on tutoring, test prep and counseling services.

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**22) Do the standards require districts and states to collect more data
on students?**

No. There is confusion on this point because [Race to the
Top](http://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/), the big federal grant
program launched in 2009, [incentivized and
funded](http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/delaware-and-tennessee-win-first-race-top-grants)
both the adoption of national standards and the creation of statewide
longitudinal data systems that track individual students from
kindergarten through postsecondary education.

So in the past few years pretty much all states have started [collecting
and coordinating more data on
students](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/slds/stateinfo.asp). Common Core
test scores are and will be part of that data collection. But the two
trends are not directly connected.

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**23) Opponents of Common Core argue that the standards tell teachers
what to teach. Is this true?**

Not really. The only required reading from Common Core comes in the 11th
and 12th grades, when kids will be expected to read and understand
foundational documents of historical and literary significance: the
Declaration of Independence, the Preamble to the Constitution, the Bill
of Rights and Lincoln's second inaugural address.

Much of the confusion comes from Appendix B. It includes dozens of
titles that the Common Core writers consider "text exemplars" — in other
words, suggestions for teachers looking for age-appropriate reading
material that will help their students reach core benchmarks. They
include everything from *Green Eggs and Ham* to Shakespeare's Sonnet 73.
But these texts are recommended, not required. The standards also call
for a balance of informational texts and literature but, again, do not
require specific books or reading materials.

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**24) How do teachers unions feel about Common Core?**

That's tricky. Both the National Education Association and American
Federation of Teachers support the standards, but their rank and file
are uncomfortable and increasingly unhappy with the implementation.
Seven out of 10 teachers say the transition to a curriculum tied to
Common Core isn't working. Two-thirds of teachers say they were not
asked for input on how to develop the implementation plan. Teachers also
say they need time to make sure they understand the standards and are
able to talk to parents about them. In the meantime, unions are calling
for a delay, not in implementation of the standards but in holding
teachers accountable for test results. In California, Gov. Jerry Brown
has already said teachers there won't be judged this year on student
performance as the state transitions from old standards to new.

###### [Back to top](#top)

* * * * *

**25) How will we know if all of this is working?**

It will take at least a few years of transition time to know for sure if
the Common Core is working as designed. Advocates of the standards say
they want Common Core to be measured by increased college and career
readiness for graduates, as well as our results on international tests
like the PISA. But that's if the backlash doesn't force a rollback of
the standards before they fully go into use.
