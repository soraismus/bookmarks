** "Free" is a word with a powerful appeal. And right now it's being
tossed around a lot, followed by another word: "college."

A new nonprofit, [Redeeming America's
Promise](http://www.redeemingamericaspromise.org/), announced this week
that it will seek federal support to make public colleges tuition-free.
That effort is inspired by "Hope" and "Promise" programs like the one in
Kalamazoo, Mich., which pays up to 100 percent of college tuition at
state colleges and universities for graduates of the city's public high
schools.

[Starbucks announced
a](http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/06/16/322402574/starbucks-will-pay-for-employees-to-complete-college)
tuition benefit for its employees that will cover classes taken online
from Arizona State University.

And we wrote last week about a [Tulsa, Okla.,
program](http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/06/11/320633113/college-for-free-tulsa-radical-idea)
that pays for two years of community college for county residents.

In reality there's no free college, just as there's no free lunch. The
real policy discussion is about how to best distribute the burden of
paying for it — between individual families and the public at large —
and, secondly, how to hold down the cost of providing it. All while
leveraging the power of "free" responsibly.

**Fueling A Bubble**

For many conservatives, the answer is simple. An education makes
individuals richer, and individuals should bear the cost. "The state
should not subsidize intellectual curiosity," said [Ronald
Reagan](http://www.newfoundations.com/Clabaugh/CuttingEdge/Reagan.html#_edn3),
back when he was running for governor of California. In recent times,
the conservative position is perhaps best expressed by economist Richard
Vedder, director of the [Center for College Affordability and
Productivity.](http://centerforcollegeaffordability.org/about/staff-directoryhttp://centerforcollegeaffordability.org/about/staff-directory)

In his books, articles and public appearances, Vedder argues that
federal student aid is creating a bubble that allows colleges to raise
prices indefinitely, and the only way to stop the cycle is to cut off
public funding.

Kevin Carey, now the director of the higher education policy program at
the nonpartisan New America Foundation, made pretty much the same
argument[in the New
Republic](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/politics/99415/college-tuition-afford-higher-education)
in 2012. He compared public universities to apple vendors:

> You, the apple vendor, look at the situation and say, "Hey, the market
> price of an apple is still $1. Wouldn't it be great if I could charge
> $1 for apples, but still get 40 cents from the government for every
> apple I sell?" ... So you start raising prices by 3, 4, or 5 percent
> above inflation annually.

In a world with no public subsidy at all for education, the only option
left for free tuition would be something like the [Starbucks
plan](http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/06/16/322402574/starbucks-will-pay-for-employees-to-complete-college)
— large corporations or wealthy donors footing the bill. And that kind
of "free" comes, generally, with a significant catch — like requiring
students to work for a certain employer.

**The Public Piggy Bank**

At the other end of the political spectrum are those who see a large
public obligation to pay for the education of citizens, to promote
democracy, meritocracy and equal rights, among other things. They just
can't agree on how.

Once upon a time, public university in this country actually was free,
for the most part. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, from New York
to California, states opted to charge no tuition or nominal fees.

Here's the catch. Until World War II, college was also pretty sparsely
attended. In 1940, only about 5 percent of the population, most of them
white men, had a bachelor's degree. And the U.S. was the most educated
nation in the world! The small numbers made tuition relatively cheap to
subsidize.

But starting with the GI Bill, the United States moved to a new model of
"mass" higher education. The expansion continued through the 1960s, with
the 1965 Higher Education Act establishing federal student-aid programs.

Suddenly, most high school graduates — men, women, black, white, new
immigrants — aspired to a college degree. In defiance of the laws of
economics, as the supply of college graduates went up, so did the demand
for them, year after year. A college degree pretty much always meant you
made more money.

Graduates also paid more taxes, so the government got its money back in
the long term — $6 for every dollar spent on the GI Bill, by some
estimates.

**No Such Thing**

Starting in the 1970s, there was a backlash to all this free money. In
the economic slump, federal and state subsidies to higher education
tightened. Enrollments declined. Loans, which were cheaper for the
government, began to replace grants.

Public universities responded to the decreased state subsidies by
raising tuition. They responded to the increased availability of loan
financing by raising tuition. They responded to the continued robust
demand for higher education by raising tuition. They responded to the
pressure to expand, adding new programs and majors and building bigger
campuses, by raising tuition. Since 1978, public university tuition has
climbed every single year, two or three times faster than inflation.
Average student loan debt for a bachelor's degree: $29,400.

Sara Goldrick-Rab of the University of Wisconsin, Madison sums up the
results of all this in a paper she wrote last year for the [Lumina
Foundation](http://www.luminafoundation.org/publications/ideas_summit/Redefining_College_Affordability.pdf):

> Talented students are forgoing college because of the costs, students
> who start college are unable to complete because they cannot afford to
> continue, and even students who finish degrees may not realize all of
> the expected returns because of sizable debt burdens.

The United States is no longer the most educated nation in the world —
it's the 12th. Most of the countries ahead of it have lower-cost public
university options than the U.S. Perhaps most damning, the high cost of
college in this country helps ensure that in too many cases, wealth
trumps merit.

The success rate in college for the lowest-achieving but highest-income
students is [slightly
better](http://www.epi.org/publication/webfeatures_snapshots_20051012)
than the success rate for the highest-achieving, lowest-income students.

**Found Money**

Out-of-control college costs are hurting the most vulnerable. There are
many different efforts to pacify the giant octopus.

The new proposals bank on the fact that the federal government already
[spends lots of
money](http://trends.collegeboard.org/student-aid/figures-tables/total-student-aid-nonfederal-loans-2012-constant-dollars-over-time)
on student aid: $47 billion in grants a year, $101 billion in loans
(which are repaid), and another $20 billion in tax credits. The total of
state, federal and private money going to defray the cost of tuition —
that's distinct from state appropriations directly to institutions — is
$247 billion per year.

Seems like with that kind of dough, there ought to be ways of buying
better access and more equity.

There's substantial evidence that low-income students are less likely to
even aspire to college because they think it's too expensive. It affects
things like their choice of math classes as early as sixth grade.

That's why so many of these programs have the word "promise" or "hope"
in the name. The student-aid bureaucracy is complicated to navigate.
"Free college" is a promise everyone can understand.

Redeeming America's Promise calls for offering a full scholarship to a
public two- or four-year college to every academically qualified student
from families making no more than $160,000 a year. Part of the money,
they say, could come from Pell Grants and tax credits, which would no
longer be needed. [(This math has been
challenged).](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/06/18/new-nonprofit-unveils-plan-federally-funded-full-tuition-scholarships#sthash.Kgu05BFJ.dpbs)

Goldrick-Rab, a scholar who studies access to higher education, argued
in her paper last year for the Lumina Foundation that the federal
student-aid budget would and should go to pay for two years of universal
free public college for all comers, including books, supplies, even a
living stipend for those who need it.

**The Fine Print**

Unfortunately, most attempts to defray the cost of college come with
unintended consequences.

For a good example, look no further than Georgia's HOPE Scholarship.
This statewide program, dating from 1993, offers high school graduates
who meet certain requirements scholarships at a state university. At one
time, about a dozen states had created similar models.

According to this [early look](http://www.nber.org/papers/w7756) at the
impact of the HOPE program, by Susan Dynarski for the National Bureau of
Economic Research, "Georgia's program has likely increased the college
attendance rate of all 18- to 19-year-olds by 7.0 to 7.9 percentage
points."

Not too shabby. However, "the evidence suggests that Georgia's program
has widened the gap in college attendance between blacks and whites and
between those from low- and high-income families."

Wait a minute. So a free tuition plan, instead of helping low-income and
minority students, actually left them farther behind? Yes, and that
result has [been seen in other
states](http://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/college-access/financing/state-merit-scholarship-programs-and-racial-inequality/heller-marin-state-merit-scholarship-2004.pdf).
It happens because these state programs require certain high school GPAs
and test scores, and require that students maintain a certain GPA in
college. And proportionately more middle-class white kids meet those
bars.

**Nothing Left To Lose**

Most of the conversations about free college, as we've seen, are really
about moving around piles of government money and other funds.

Some folks are starting to talk about whether we can meaningfully lower
the cost of delivering a college education, instead of or in addition to
paying for it differently. Most of those conversations have something to
do with technology.

Some thought Massive Open Online Courses would be the Holy Grail: free,
high-quality college for everyone! But in that case, "free" led to lower
commitment. Completion rates for MOOCs hover around[5 to 7
percent.](http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/opinions/ieee-roundup/low-completion-rates-for-moocs)

Blended programs, which are self-paced and combine online learning with
assistance from real people by phone or in person, seem to be able to
hold down costs and get good results at the same time. Like [Western
Governors University,](http://www.wgu.edu/) a nonprofit whose
[teacher-prep program](http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/1998028) was the
National Council of Teacher Quality's first-ranked program in the
country this week. It manages to charge less than the average public
university without taking any public subsidy.

The unique thing about education, and what makes it so hard to control
the price, is that it's not just a service or a good. It's a process,
and the learner takes an active role in creating its value. A college
education may never be free, but for many people it will remain
priceless.
