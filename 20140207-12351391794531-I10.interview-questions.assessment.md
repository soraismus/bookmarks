The Firing Squad Problem
------------------------

### Introduction

In 1957, John Myhill first posed an interesting problem that was closely
related to computer programming, but did not require any related
background to solve. Dubbed the "firing squad synchronization problem,"
the puzzle was passed along by word of mouth and first solved by Marvin
Minsky and John McCarthy. However, even though it was widely known and
had already been solved, it wasn't until years later, in 1964, that
Edward Moore at Bell Telephone Laboratories published a short paper
establishing the question in print. Since then, many have found
solutions of varying complexity and elegance, as well as posed and
solved different variations of the original question. Today, the firing
squad problem is featured in most discussions of automata theory, and
increasingly efficient solutions are still being explored.

### The Problem

Picture a group of soldiers standing in a line, with a general at one
end. Assume that all of the soldiers are mentally keeping track of time
by counting at the same speed. In other words, after a certain signal,
all soldiers should be counting out zero, one, two, and so forth, at the
same time as everyone else. At every count, each soldier looks at their
neighbors, considers what they themselves were already doing, and
decides what to do next, completely according to what they see. Of
course, the two soldiers on the ends have to act according to what
themselves and their one neighbor is doing. In more mathematical terms,
the actions, or state, of each soldier at time t+1 depend on the actions
of itself and its neighbors at the previous time t. For all soldiers,
there is a limited, or finite, amount of actions that can be done, and
there are set rules for finding out which actions follow given
observations. Using technical terms, the soldiers can be seen as
**synchronous**, **finite-state machines**, whose states at any given
time are dependant only upon themselves and their neighbors.

The concept of **synchronization** arises when the initial state of a
machine is known or partially unknown, yet the task requires that the
machine be brought to a specified final state. In this case, it is first
necessary to bring the machine to a known, intermediate state,
identified by a resulting output sequence. As soon as the intermediate
state is identified, a second input sequence is selected, and the
machine is sent to the desired final state. For some machines, it is
possible to use one sequence to take the machine from the unknown
initial state to the known final state. In this case, the input sequence
is known as a *synchronizing sequence*, and the *synchronizing
problem*is considered solvable.

The question begins when the general gives the signal to fire, and does
not do anything else. Assume all of the soldiers start off in the same,
inactive, state, called the quiescent state. After a count of time, the
soldier closest to the general reacts to the signal by changing what its
doing, equivalent to a machine changing its state. As time goes by, the
signal propagates down the line, moving at most one soldier per count.
Of course, each individual soldier might be changing their own state
according to the states of themselves and their neighbors. Assuming that
there is a fixed number of states, regardless of how many soldiers there
are in the line, how can the states be defined such that all soldiers
enter the same firing, or terminal, state at the exact same time? In
other words, the same definitions for the states should still work even
if the number of soldiers is dramatically increased.

### Minimal Time Solution

If there are n soldiers in line, including the general, and signals
propagate down the line with the fastest speed of at most one soldier at
a time, it is clear that any solution must take at least 2n-2 units of
time (the amount of time for a signal to travel all the way down the
line and back). Although others may have solved for such a solution at
an earlier date, Abraham Waksman's least-time solution published in 1966
([source](refs.html#waksman)) is often considered one of the first, and
will be explored below.

There are six basic states, four of which have subdivisions:

-   Q: the starting quiescent state
-   T: the final firing state
-   R: the trigger signal for the B state
    -   R~0~ - propagates left
    -   R~1~ - propagates right

-   B: the state that generates the P state
    -   B~0~ - blocks the R state
    -   B~1~ - passes through the R state

-   P: the state that generates the A state, and leads to the terminal
    state if both neighbors are also in the P state
    -   P~0~ - generates A~0xx~
    -   P~1~ - generates A~1xx~

-   A: the propagating state
    -   A~000~, A~111~, A~010~, A~011~, A~100~, A~101~, A~110~, ~111~
    -   A~0xx~ - generates the R state with no delay
    -   A~1xx~ - has a one unit time delay in R generation
    -   All A~x00~ and ~x01~ - propagates to the left
    -   All A~x10~ and ~x11~ - propagates to the right

There are two additional placeholder states:

-   φ: external state, no machine to this side
-   γ: neighbors not explicitly mentioned

For comprehensive state tables, see the[following section](#stable).

To better understand how the states interact, Waksman provides a basic
explanation of how his solution works ([source](refs.html#waksman)):

> Some facts:
>
> 1.  Every A signal can be called either even or odd based on whether
>     it is currently at an even or odd machine. The parity is
>     determined starting from the machine which originally generated
>     the signal.
> 2.  Every machine with an even A signal generates a new R signal that
>     travels in the opposite direction of the machines A signal
> 3.  Each type of B signal will switch to the other type upon
>     intersection with an R signal. One type allows the R signal to
>     continue propagating, the other does not
> 4.  When signals A and B intersect, they set up a new generator, or P
>     signal
>
> Since, as seen in fact 2, every second machine in state A generates a
> new R signal traveling in the opposite direction, there is a 3 unit
> time separation between two R signals traveling through the same
> machine.
>
> Basically, each machine that enters the B state will remain in that
> state for three time units, until an R signal reaches it. At that
> time, the B state will move to the next machine in a direction
> opposing the R signal.
>
> Seeing as how the number of soldiers can be arbitrarily large, an
> efficient system of dividing up the line of soldiers is needed. For
> each division of the line, the signal must propagate through at a
> certain time delay so that signals returning from the end of the line
> will coincide at the right moment, allowing all soldiers to fire at
> the same time. From the aforementioned observations, Waksman derived a
> formula for determining how much of a time unit delay was needed per
> machine, given the number of divisions:
>
> divisions
>
> time unit delay per machine
>
> 1
>
> 2(2 ^1\\ -\\ 1^) + 1
>
> 3
>
> 2
>
> 2(2 ^2\\ -\\ 1^) + 1
>
> 7
>
> 3
>
> 2(2 ^3\\ -\\ 1^) + 1
>
> 15
>
> 4
>
> 2(2 ^4\\ -\\ 1^) + 1
>
> 31
>
> k
>
> 2(2 ^k\\ -\\ 1^) + 1
>
> 2 ^k+1^ - 1
>
> Therefore, the B~k~ signal must have a time unit delay per machine, or
> rate of propagation, of 1/(2 ^k+1^ - 1) for k divisions.

### Solution Comparison

Since the problem's conception, many solutions have been published and a
countless number have been found. Some of them take the least time to
complete (2n-2), others require the least amount of states (6), some do
both (Mazoyer's solution), and many others are simply easier to
understand. For all of these, the states and soldiers can be represented
graphically and then compared. Just by looking at these results, you can
see how different numbers of states, time units, and methods, influence
how the complexity and flow of a solution
([source](http://xraysgi.ims.uconn.edu/fsquad/firing.html)):

Anonymous, 3n time, 160 soldiers, 13 states

Waksman, 2n-2 minimal-time, 192 soldiers, 16 states

Balzer, 2n-2 minimal-time, 160 soldiers, 8 states

Mazoyer, 2n-2 minimal-time, 200 soldiers, 6 states

### Variations

Just as there are many different solutions to the problem, numerous
variations to the question have been posed and solved. Here, a few
changes to the positions of the soldiers are explored and analyzed.

**Original problem**: N soldiers, including the general, are in a
straight line. The general is placed at one end of the line.

**Moore and Langdon's generalization**: The general can be anywhere
along the line.

> In a line of n soldiers, including the general, let k represent the
> number of soldiers between the general and the nearest end. (According
> to this definition, k can never be greater than (n+1)/2 - 1.
>
> **Theorem**: In the general case as defined above, the amount of time
> needed for the line to fire at the same time is at least 2n-2-k. (When
> the general is at the end, k is 0 and the theorem still holds.)
>
> Proof by contradiction:
>
> -   For a given k, assume the general is somewhere on the left side of
>     the line, at position k+1. \
> -   Now assume there is a line of soldiers, S, where k is an integer
>     and 1 ≤ k ≤ (n+1)/2 - 1, where n is an arbitrary number of
>     soldiers (including the general). This line, S, has length n' and
>     the general at position k'+1. \
> -   Now assume that for this line, S, the firing squad is able to fire
>     at time t = m, where m < 2n'-2-k'. \
> -   According to this setup, in order for the first soldier to receive
>     a signal from the th soldier, a total of 2n'-2-k' units of time
>     must pass (n'-1- k' units for the signal to travel from general to
>     n', plus n'-1 units for the signal to travel back from n' to 1).\
> -   However, the total time m is less than this amount, meaning the
>     first soldier managed to enter the firing state without ever
>     having received a signal from the n'th soldier. \
> -   Thus, the first soldier fires without any influence from any
>     soldiers including and beyond the n'th one. \
> -   Now if we were to add on n'+2 more soldiers to the right of the
>     line, the first soldier would still fire at the original time, m.
>     This is true because with regard to the first soldier, nothing
>     about the line or states has changed. \
> -   Yet, since m < 2n'-2-k' as defined above, the 2n'+2 soldier is
>     still in the original, quiescent, state while the first soldier is
>     already firing.\
> -   Therefore, the line S cannot represent a valid solution, which
>     contradicts the original premise, and m < 2n'-2-k' cannot be true.
>     \
> -   By *mutatis mutandis*, or substituting the appropriate terms as
>     necessary, this proof can be applied to all possible placements of
>     the general.
>
> Once the above proof established a minimum value for the solution,
> results that take time t = 2n-2-k are found and analyzed. The problem
> becomes equivalent to assuming the general started at the end at a
> time k units ago, and is solved by continuing the signal propagation.

**Karel Culik's theorems**: One general and n-1 soldiers are arranged in
a closed ring.

> **Result 1**: If the ring is a two-way signaling synchronized ring,
> the minimal time solution is n-1.
>
> > Although the proof itself is somewhat involved and builds upon some
> > earlier results, this idea makes intuitive sense. Basically, if for
> > a straight line, where signals travel along that line, the solution
> > takes 2n-2, it makes sense that a bi-directional solution should
> > take half as much time.
>
> **Result 2**: If the ring is a one-way signaling synchronized ring,
> the minimal time solution is 2n-2.
>
> > Again, the actual proof is best described by Culik itself, but
> > similar to Result 1, this also makes sense. Since the signals only
> > travel along one-way, the ring is equivalent to a straight line with
> > the general at one end. This straight-line equivalence makes the
> > problem the same as the original one, and the solution therefore
> > also takes at least 2n-2 units of time.
>
> (For detailed proofs, see the [original text](refs.html#culik).)
