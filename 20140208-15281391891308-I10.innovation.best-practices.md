 How to Create an Idea Factory

![TeamInnovation.jpg](http://www.ideachampions.com/weblogs/TeamInnovation.jpg)

One of the reasons why most BIG IDEAS go nowhere is because the idea
originators do not have a team of collaborators on board to help develop
and execute their ideas.

In the absence of collaborators, the idea originators either try to do
everything themselves (not a good idea) or spend so much time trying to
enroll people *on the fly* that the idea loses momentum and eventually
evaporates.

Simply put, it's easy to *conceive*. It's harder to *deliver* the baby.

But *what if* each of us who comes up with a potentially game-changing
idea *already* had a team of collaborators in place -- people who were
poised and ready to respond with *enthusiasm*, *skill*, and *clarity*?

This is not a new idea. There are examples in many other domains: Swat
Teams, Firefighters, and Emergency Rooms, just to name a few.

![Working\_Together\_Teamwork\_and-team-building-exercises.jpg](http://www.ideachampions.com/weblogs/Working_Together_Teamwork_and-team-building-exercises.jpg)

These are people who are *there when you need them*. They are skilled.
They know their roles. They are team players. And they are totally
*committed* -- even when tired, cranky, and under-appreciated.

YOU need something similar every time you come up with a big idea. OK.
Maybe not *every* time -- but at least *sometimes*.

Here are the people I want in my Idea Factory (or, as one friend renamed
it, my "Opportunity Incubator").

1.**Brainstorm Buddy** to help develop the idea, give feedback, share
insights, and keep me on my game.

\2. **Researcher** to gather information, best practices, data,
resources, etc.

\3. **Finance Person** to do projections, budgets, and help build the
business case.

\4. **Marketing Maven** to help me sell the idea -- in house and out
there in the "real world."

\5. **Writer** to create proposals, business cases, and other support
materials.

Five people. That's it. On call. Part time.

**THE PROCESS?**

\1. The Big Idea comes to you.\
 2. You write a brief and email it to your Fab Five\
 3. On a conference call, you present the idea -- and get feedback.\
 4. You make specific requests to each member of the team.\
 5. You stay in close touch with all Idea Factory cohorts -- making sure
to share info, progress, changes, and successes.

Anything I've forgotten? Any members of the team I should add? What
would *you* need from *me* in order to say YES to playing one of the
five roles noted above?

Or... are you ready to start your *own* idea factory?\
 *\
 PS: These do not have to be paid positions. I'm talking about inviting
your friends or colleagues who are "in the zone" and would love to be
involved in some cool projects with you.*

hi mitch

what you are suggesting requires lot's of quality communication\
 tonight at the dinner party the question was posed and passed around
'what project would you endeavor if you knew you could not fail?' \
 my answer was that all human beings would be connected in a
communications network based on the acknowlegment that we are all one
because we are fundamentally connected by our aspiration to be fulfilled
and by our mortality\
 the ramifications would be that we could and would solve all (or most
of) our problems and have alot of fun doing it \
 kind of like the ancient stories of the greek gods the real action was
with the humans because they could not only feel the divine aspirations
of love and glory but also the cold wind of mortality\
 the humans are heroic the gods are not \
 the humans experience a passion the gods don't know because they can't
die or become bereaved unless ofcourse they become human \
 lovely arwen the elfin princess from the lord of the rings made that
choice\
 so here we are\
 i applaud your idea factory idea \
 my idea is to create a communications training where the stumbling
blocks and dead end strategies are identified and alternative strategies
are suggested and practiced in some sort of a workshop environment and
then to make it available to groups or communities that see the need for
more effective communications tools\

Ian: Maybe. It all depends on the project. So, if you are willing, send
me your email address and i will email you a very simple 2-page doc that
will give you a chance to describe your project and the kind of help you
are looking for. I will review it within 48 hours and get back to you
with a YES or NO. Does that work for you? Mitch
