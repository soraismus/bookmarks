Server-rendered React components in Rails
=========================================

Warning: experimental stuff ahead. Make sure you know more about running
Rails in production than I do before you take this & run with it. \

Here's my favourite slide from [Pete Hunt's JSConf EU
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY) on
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) (which you should totally
watch).

!["That is, React components are basically just idempotent functions.
They describe your UI at any point in time, just like a server-rendered
app."](/images/react-slide-9ada8156.png)

If you render a React component with the same data, it will always
return the same result. It makes absolutely no difference whether you do
that rendering on the client or the server.

That brings us to the official front end buzzword of 2014: **[Isomorphic
JavaScript](http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/)**.

The Holy Grail. The [united UI
layer](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2013/10/07/node-js-and-the-new-web-front-end/).
Serve up real HTML on first page load, then kick off a client side JS
app. All without duplicating a single line of UI code.

React makes this really easy if your back end is Node.js:

~~~~ {.highlight .javascript}
// Our component...
var HelloMessage = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
  }
});

// ...can be rendered to a string on the server...
React.renderComponentToString(HelloMessage({name: "John"}));

// ...then on the client, renderComponent will preserve
// the server-rendered markup & just attach event handlers
React.renderComponent(<HelloMessage name="John" />, mountNode);
~~~~

Awesome? Awesome. Except I spend most of my day working on a [big old
Rails
app](http://webuild.envato.com/blog/upgrading-ruby-on-rails-at-production-scale/).

The react-rails gem
-------------------

The official [react-rails gem](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails)
is pretty great. The current 1.0.0.pre release gives you

-   React
-   Asset pipeline JSX compilation
-   An unobtrusive JS adapter that automatically mounts React components
    on HTML elements that have special data attributes (similar to
    [jquery-ujs](https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs))
-   A view helper `react_component` for generating that mount node

By default, the `react_component` helper generates an empty div with
data attributes, onto which `react_ujs` comes along and mounts a
component.

However, thanks to [John
Lynch](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails/pull/24), if you specify
the `:prerender => true` option the helper actually executes (via
ExecJS) `React.renderComponentToString` and renders the component server
side.

The Rails code
--------------

I built a [tiny, super simple, stock Rails
app](http://sample-react-rails-app.herokuapp.com/comments) ([code on
GitHub](https://github.com/bensmithett/sample-react-rails-app)) using
the `CommentBox` component from the [React
tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) to try
this out. It looks like this:

!["app screengrab"](/images/react-app-f2140812.gif)

The whole thing is a React component composed of smaller React
components, all server-rendered using the exact same JS files that are
used by the client side JS app.

Here's `index.html.erb` in its entirety:

~~~~ {.highlight .erb}
<%= react_component('CommentBox', 
                    {:presenter => @presenter.to_json}, 
                    {:prerender => true}) %>
~~~~

The Rails controller defines a presenter that gives the component all
the initial data it needs to render.

~~~~ {.highlight .ruby}
def index
  @presenter = {
    :comments => Comment.last(5),
    :form => {
      :action => comments_path,
      :csrf_param => request_forgery_protection_token,
      :csrf_token => form_authenticity_token
    }
  }
end
~~~~

When the page loads, react\_ujs sees the component & calls
`React.renderComponent` on it, which is smart enough to preserve the
server rendered markup & just add event handlers.

With the client side app bootstrapped, the form submits via ajax & adds
the new comment to the list. But if the JS fails to load or initialise,
the form will submit normally with a full page refresh. Progressive
enhancement ahoy!

You can test this out by appending
[?js=broken](http://sample-react-rails-app.herokuapp.com/comments?js=broken)
to load the demo without loading any JS.

You need to make the Rails controller handle both the ajax & non-ajax
scenarios.

~~~~ {.highlight .ruby}
def create
  @comment = Comment.new(comment_params)
  @comment.save

  if request.xhr?
    render :json => Comment.last(5)
  else
    redirect_to comments_path
  end
end
~~~~

Back in the client side [CommentBox
component](https://github.com/bensmithett/sample-react-rails-app/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/react_components/_comment_box.js.jsx),
when the ajax request completes, we simply update it with the new state
& React does its thing.

~~~~ {.highlight .javascript}
$.ajax({
  // ...
  success: function ( data ) {
    this.setState({ comments: data });
  }.bind( this )
});
~~~~

This is so awesome!
-------------------

You don't need a DOM on the server and, React being React, you're not
even really thinking about the DOM on the client. Because components are
basically just idempotent functions, you can render them in any
environment you like as long as you have some data representing the
current state and the ability to execute JS.

There are some rough edges. Forms are harder. There are no Rails view
helpers in React land. Passing in CSRF tokens & hand coding a hidden
field every time is gonna get old fast.

That said, after playing around with this for a day, using different
templates & languages depending on whether you're rendering on the
client or server feels totally arbitrary & stupid. The *sometimes ERB,
sometimes Handlebars* workflow feels so kludgy now.

I'm looking forward to this future :D

*Side note:* If you don't want to execute JS right there in your Rails
app, another interesting approach is to spin up a Node.js app whose sole
responsibility is rendering React components to strings. There's an
[example](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/examples/server-rendering)
of this views-as-a-service-over-http setup in the React repo.
