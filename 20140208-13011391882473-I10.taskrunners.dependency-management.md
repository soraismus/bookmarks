And just like that Grunt and RequireJS are out, it’s all about Gulp and Browserify now
======================================================================================

Posted on [January 6,
2014](http://www.100percentjs.com/just-like-grunt-gulp-browserify-now/ "7:55 pm")
by [Martin
Genev](http://www.100percentjs.com/author/martin-genev/ "View all posts by Martin Genev")

In a demonstration of how insane the Javascript world is, a revolution
happened last week and it looks like Grunt was dethroned as the go-to
task -runner. But wait you may say, wasn’t the Node and Grunt revolution
just beginning? After all Grunt had just managed to find its way to job
descriptions. Apparently we weren’t done revolutionizing.

This is how it happened from my point of view. I got linked to this:

When I saw that first post I knew [Addy
Osmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani "Addy Osmani") is always way out
on the front lines so I thought there are still some months of using
Grunt before Gulp takes over.

But then when[Hage Yaapa](https://twitter.com/hacksparrow "Hage Yaapa"),
who wrote[a great book on
Express](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nQ_I1yuV_DwC&source=productsearch&utm_source=HA_Desktop_US&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=PLA&pcampaignid=MKTAD0930BO1 "Express Web Application Development")
and who always posts great resources, praised it so much I realized it’s
probably awesome.

And finally when [Sindre
Sorhus](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus "Sindre Sorhus"), also on the
yeoman team, major Javascript innovator and leading NPM contributor,
posted a [quick
tutorial](http://robo.ghost.io/getting-started-with-gulp-2/ "Simple build env for game dev with Gulp under 5 min")about
it, I had to look.

[![Screen Shot 2014-01-06 at 11.40.48
AM](http://www.100percentjs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-06-at-11.40.48-AM.png)](http://www.100percentjs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-06-at-11.40.48-AM.png)

And what I saw was that it is indeed much better, much more intuitive to
Node.js devs and simpler to use. And that concluded it for me.

So now instead of Grunt’s harder to understand syntaxes and laborious
pre-config, we have this:

    var gulp = require('gulp');  
    var browserify = require('gulp-browserify');  
    var concat = require('gulp-concat');  
    var styl = require('gulp-styl');  
    var refresh = require('gulp-livereload');  
    var lr = require('tiny-lr');  
    var server = lr();

    gulp.task('scripts', function() {  
        gulp.src(['src/**/*.js'])
            .pipe(browserify())
            .pipe(concat('dest.js'))
            .pipe(gulp.dest('build'))
            .pipe(refresh(server))
    })

    gulp.task('styles', function() {  
        gulp.src(['css/**/*.css'])
            .pipe(styl({compress : true}))
            .pipe(gulp.dest('build'))
            .pipe(refresh(server))
    })

    gulp.task('lr-server', function() {  
        server.listen(35729, function(err) {
            if(err) return console.log(err);
        });
    })

    gulp.task('default', function() {  
        gulp.run('lr-server', 'scripts', 'styles');

        gulp.watch('src/**', function(event) {
            gulp.run('scripts');
        })

        gulp.watch('css/**', function(event) {
            gulp.run('styles');
        })
    })

Then while taking a look at the link Sindre Sorhus posted, I noticed
[Browserify](http://browserify.org/ "browserify"). I took a look at that
and realized it gives you the Node.js module dependency on the client
which essentially eliminates the need for RequireJS or any of its
analogues.

I love it. So much better. And just like that I’m a convert. I’m always
using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/ "Gulp") and
[Browserify](http://browserify.org/ "Browserify")… Until next week!

It gets even more exciting when you take it one more step.\
 [Atomify](https://github.com/Techwraith/atomify) and
[Resin](https://github.com/topcoat/resin) allow you “require” css.\
 One more step towards a less terrible workflow.

    [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) is well worth a look
    as an alternative to Browserify as it uses
    [loaders](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/loader-list) so css
    is supported out the box

While I never used Grunt, you are right with Browserify. It’s the single
true way to do front-end JavaScript.

Grunt totally changed the way I maintain applications and I’m very
grateful for that. Looking forward to testing Gulp, with an ominous
feeling I’ll be spending the next days upgrading my apps to it! Cheers
for the article!

Am I the only one that finds this article a bit ridiculous?

First of all, he complains about spending a “whole day”…a single day…to
learn about a new technology. Next, he states that gulp is “mind
blowingly intuitive” of which gulp and grunt have NEARLY THE SAME
SYNTAX. I’m willing to bet, had he learned gulp first, THEN grunt, he
would have just as much of a ramp up time learning gulp.

That said, from a glance, seems like gulp is just a more prepackaged
version of grunt with all of the most used plugins ready out of the box,
we’ll see who wins out.

That came to my mind, too, but I had to accepted it, cause I never used
Grunt or Gulp. (I’m still using good old makefiles, btw.)

I’m with you Jonathan.

Grunt did take me more than a day to figure out, but it was well worth
it. I happen to like the configuration-over-code approach, and enjoy the
large number of contributions available for almost any conceivable task.

I’m not about to change my task runner because some new kid arrives on
the block

P.S. the Gulp plugins page just keeps loading, and loading and loading…

Jonathan, Gulp is way more than “just a more prepackaged version of
grunt”. Have you ever needed to perform more than one operation on a
single file? The solution to this problem in Grunt is to utilize
temporary files. In Gulp, there is no solution because there is no
problem. It’s a streaming API – you just pipe the streamed source of the
file down to the next operation and that’s it. You’re done. Simple. No
need for temporary files. It’s also faster. I think the only thing left
to improve in the task runner world is running multiple tasks on
multiple files at the same time without relying on temporary files.

This looks awesome – much more intuitive syntax for a Node.js developer
IMO. Anything on requiring templates? If you could require templates, in
addition to CSS with node-style syntax, and have the bundling and
de-duplication handled by Browserify then that would be really awesome!

Long and short of it to me, it feels like pick one and stick with it,
otherwise you’re wasting time just joining the “next big thing”
bandwagon.

    I think what you all guys are looking for is
    [component/component](https://github.com/component/component).
    CommonJS (node-style) module loading, and components are not just
    js. They can be CSS, templates, fonts, images …

    Component is basically browserify, but more flexible, faster
    installs without garbage, and not sharing the registry with node
    modules is imo a plus. I don’t know how would I feel about
    submitting a font into npm. I know they don’t mind, but it just
    feels weird. Especially in a name-snatching environment that is npm
    registry.

Hello.

I could not make it work with CoffeeScript sources. Same code in
JavaScript works ok, but in CoffeeScript + gulp-coffee throws an error.

` /-src   app.coffee   index.coffee gulpfile.js`

src/app.coffee:\
 ` App =     start: () ->         console.log "app started"`

module.exports = App\

src/index.coffee:\
 ` App = require './app' App.start()`

gulpfile.js:\

` var gulp = require('gulp'); var browserify = require('gulp-browserify'); var concat = require('gulp-concat'); var styl = require('gulp-styl'); var coffee = require('gulp-coffee'); var less = require('gulp-less'); var refresh = require('gulp-livereload'); var lr = require('tiny-lr'); var server = lr();`

gulp.task('scripts\_coffee', function () {\
 gulp.src(['src/index.coffee'])\
 .pipe(coffee())\
 .pipe(browserify())\
 .pipe(concat('dest.js'))\
 .pipe(gulp.dest('build/coffee'))\
 .pipe(refresh(server));\
 });\

running ‘gulp scripts\_coffee’\
 gives the following:\

` stream.js:94       throw er; // Unhandled stream error in pipe.             ^ Error: module "./app" not found from "/Users/mickey/Projects/nodejs/gulp_test/src/fake_87c578d8.js"     at /Users/mickey/Projects/nodejs/gulp_test/node_modules/gulp-browserify/node_modules/browserify/index.js:570:23     at /Users/mickey/Projects/nodejs/gulp_test/node_modules/gulp-browserify/node_modules/browserify/node_modules/browser-resolve/index.js:183:24     at /Users/mickey/Projects/nodejs/gulp_test/node_modules/gulp-browserify/node_modules/browserify/node_modules/browser-resolve/node_modules/resolve/lib/async.js:36:22     at load (/Users/mickey/Projects/nodejs/gulp_test/node_modules/gulp-browserify/node_modules/browserify/node_modules/browser-resolve/node_modules/resolve/lib/async.js:54:43)     at /Users/mickey/Projects/nodejs/gulp_test/node_modules/gulp-browserify/node_modules/browserify/node_modules/browser-resolve/node_modules/resolve/lib/async.js:60:22     at /Users/mickey/Projects/nodejs/gulp_test/node_modules/gulp-browserify/node_modules/browserify/node_modules/browser-resolve/node_modules/resolve/lib/async.js:16:47     at Object.oncomplete (fs.js:97:15)`

If you´re using coffeescript you can skip the whole require/include
part. Most of the times i create a setup.coffee, main.coffee and a lib
folder with some \*.coffee classes. All you need then is a Gulp/Grunt
task and concatenate all files “\*\*/\*.coffee”.

“setup.coffee” first, then all lib coffee files and at last the
main.coffee. Build then one JS file out of it.

Benefits:\
 \* no require code\
 \* no path issues\
 \* rename files or create sub-dirs without changing code oder configs

One thing to note is that Browserify, although a great tool, does not
have the client-side flexibility of requirejs when it comes to tasks
like breaking applications into discrete, lazy-loadable modules. It’s
more of a thing for when you want to run code at both ends of the wire
or package a small node.js library for use in the browser – as always,
YMMV on a per-project basis.

The Javascript world isn’t insane. Those who think build systems are
some big deal are.

Browserify, OTOH, is the cat’s pyjamas.

I wonder what that genius Halliday thinks? Oh wait:

TJ’s opinion is pretty easy to infer, as well.
