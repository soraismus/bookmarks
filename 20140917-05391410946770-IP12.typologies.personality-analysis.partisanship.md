Beyond Red vs. Blue: The Political Typology
===========================================

Even in an increasingly Red vs. Blue nation, the public’s political
attitudes and values come in many shades and hues.

[![The 2014 Political Typology: Polarized Wings, a Diverse
Middle](http://www.people-press.org/files/2014/06/PP-2014-06-26-typology-0-01.png)](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/the-political-typology-beyond-red-vs-blue/pp-2014-06-26-typology-0-01/)Partisan
polarization – the vast and growing gap between Republicans and
Democrats – is a defining feature of politics today. But beyond the
ideological wings, which make up a minority of the public, the political
landscape includes a center that is large and diverse, unified by
frustration with politics and little else. As a result, both parties
face formidable challenges in reaching beyond their bases to appeal to
the middle of the electorate and build sustainable coalitions.

The latest Pew Research Center political typology, which sorts voters
into cohesive groups based on their attitudes and values, provides a
field guide for this constantly changing landscape. Before reading
further, [take our
quiz](http://www.people-press.org/quiz/political-typology/) to see where
you fit in the typology.

[](http://www.people-press.org/quiz/political-typology/)

#### Take the Typology Quiz

Discover which typology group you fit into and explore each group’s
views on major issues.

[](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/typology-comparison/)

#### Compare Typology Groups on Issues

The new typology has eight groups: Three are strongly ideological,
highly politically engaged and overwhelmingly partisan – two on the
right and one on the left. [**Steadfast
Conservatives**](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/typology-comparison/types/steadfast-conservatives/)are
staunch critics of government and the social safety net and are very
socially conservative. [**Business
Conservatives**](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/typology-comparison/types/business-conservatives/)
share Steadfast Conservatives’ preference for limited government, but
differ in their support for Wall Street and business, as well as
immigration reform. And Business Conservatives are far more moderate on
social issues than are Steadfast Conservatives.\
 At the other end of the spectrum, [**Solid
Liberals**](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/typology-comparison/types/solid-liberals/)express
liberal attitudes across almost every realm – government, the economy
and business and foreign policy, as well as on race, homosexuality and
abortion – and are reliable and loyal Democratic voters.

Taken together, these three groups form the electoral base of the
Democratic and Republican Parties, and their influence on American
politics is strong. While Solid Liberals, Steadfast Conservatives and
Business Conservatives collectively make up only 36% of the American
public, they represent 43% of registered voters and fully 57% of the
more politically engaged segment of the American public: those who
regularly vote and routinely follow government and public affairs.

The other typology groups are less partisan, less predictable and have
little in common with each other or the groups at either end of the
political spectrum. The one thing they do share is that they are less
engaged politically than the groups on the right or left.

[**Young
Outsiders**](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/typology-comparison/types/young-outsiders/)
lean Republican but do not have a strong allegiance to the Republican
Party; in fact they tend to dislike *both* political parties. On many
issues, from their support for environmental regulation to their liberal
views on social issues, they diverge from traditional GOP orthodoxy. Yet
in their support for limited government, Young Outsiders are firmly in
the Republicans’ camp.

[**Hard-Pressed
Skeptics**](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/typology-comparison/types/hard-pressed-skeptics/)
have been battered by the struggling economy, and their difficult
financial circumstances have left them resentful of both government and
business. Despite their criticism of government performance, they back
more generous government support for the poor and needy. Most
Hard-Pressed Skeptics say they voted for Obama in 2012, though fewer
than half approve of his job performance today.

The [**Next Generation
Left**](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/typology-comparison/types/next-generation-left/)are
young, relatively affluent and very liberal on social issues like
same-sex marriage and abortion. But they have reservations about the
cost of social programs. And while most of the Next Generation Left
support affirmative action, they decisively reject the idea that racial
discrimination is the main reason why many blacks are unable to get
ahead.

The [**Faith and Family
Left**](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/typology-comparison/types/faith-and-family-left/)
lean Democratic, based on their confidence in government and support for
federal programs to address the nation’s problems. But this very
religious, racially and ethnically diverse group is uncomfortable with
the pace of societal change, including the acceptance of homosexuality
and non-traditional family structures.

And finally, an eighth group, the
[**Bystanders**](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/typology-comparison/types/bystanders/),
representing 10% of the public, are on the sidelines of the political
process. They are not registered to vote and pay very little attention
to politics.

### What is the Typology?

The Political Typology sorts people into groups based on their attitudes
and values, not their partisan labels. It is based on the largest
political survey ever undertaken by the Pew Research Center, which also
was the data source for our June 12 report [*Political Polarization in
the American
Public*](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/)*.*The
survey was conducted among 10,013 adults from January to March of this
year. The report also includes data from follow-up interviews with many
of the initial survey’s respondents as part of the Pew Research Center’s
newly-created American Trends Panel.

#### Ideological Consistency vs. the Political Typology

Earlier this year, the Pew Research Center conducted a survey of 10,013
adults nationwide as part of a broad investigation of political changes
in the nation. The [first report on this
data](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/)
focused on political polarization and used 10 survey questions on
political values to gauge how ideologically consistent Americans have
become on a traditional left-right index.

The Political Typology represents an entirely different approach to
analyzing the American public’s values. It looks at a broader range of
questions (23 questions) and instead of focusing on a single left-right
dimension it uses a cluster analysis to find groups of Americans with
similar views across multiple dimensions. While more complex, the
typology reveals fissures on the right and left that are not evident in
a simpler left-right array. Moreover, it sheds light on the diversity of
values represented in the “center.”

The two approaches complement one another: Most of the Solid Liberals
are consistently liberal in their values, and the Steadfast
Conservatives and Business Conservatives combined make up nearly all of
the consistent conservatives. See [Section
1](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/section-1-the-political-typology-identity-and-attitudes/)
for a further discussion of how these two approaches relate to each
other.\

The polarization study found that more Americans today hold consistently
liberal or consistently conservative values across a wide range of
issues, that Democrats and Republicans are further apart ideologically
and that more partisans express deeply negative views of the other
political party, with many going so far as to see the other side as a
“threat to the nation’s well-being.”

Even so, most Americans do not view politics through uniformly liberal
or conservative lenses, and more tend to stand apart from partisan
antipathy than engage in it. But the typology shows that the center is
hardly unified. Rather, it is a combination of groups, each with their
own mix of political values, often held just as strongly as those on the
left and the right, but just not organized in consistently liberal or
conservative terms. Taken together, this “center” looks like it is
halfway between the partisan wings. But when disaggregated, it becomes
clear that there are many distinct voices in the center, often with as
little in common with each other as with those who are on the left and
the right.

The Pew Research Center’s Political Typology, [launched 27 years
ago](http://www.people-press.org/1987/09/30/the-people-the-press-politics/),
is an effort to look beyond “Red vs. Blue” in American politics,
understanding that there are multiple dimensions to American political
thinking, and that many people hold different combinations of values
than the predominantly liberal and conservative platforms offered by the
two political parties.

### Electoral Implications

[![Middle Typology Groups Least Likely to Follow Government & Public
Affairs](http://www.people-press.org/files/2014/06/PP-2014-06-26-typology-0-02.png)](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/the-political-typology-beyond-red-vs-blue/pp-2014-06-26-typology-0-02/)The
new study highlights the challenges that both parties face heading into
the 2014 and 2016 elections. Each can count on strong support from the
three staunchly partisan groups; Steadfast Conservatives and Business
Conservatives on the right, and Solid Liberals on the left. In all three
groups, 2014 midterm preferences are comparable to the overwhelming
support these groups gave their party’s presidential candidate in 2012.

The middle groups in the typology are less predictable. To be sure, the
Faith and Family Left and the Next Generation Left favor Democratic
congressional candidates this year by roughly two-to-one margins. But
they supported Barack Obama by wider margins in 2012, and their 2014
turnout is suspect. One early indicator of voter turnout is attention to
government and public affairs, and fewer than half in these groups are
following politics, compared with broad majorities in the more
ideological groups.

And the Hard-Pressed Skeptics – who say they supported Obama over Romney
by a 65%-25% margin two years ago – are more closely divided in 2014. As
they look toward this year’s midterms, 51% plan to vote for the Democrat
in their congressional district, while 37% plan to vote Republican. And
the Republican-leaning Young Outsiders intend to vote Republican this
fall by a somewhat larger margin (20 points) than they did in 2012 (11
points). Yet these groups also are less certain to turn out this fall
compared with the more partisan bases.

[![Voting Preferences of the Typology
Groups](http://www.people-press.org/files/2014/06/PP-2014-06-26-typology-0-03.png)](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/the-political-typology-beyond-red-vs-blue/pp-2014-06-26-typology-0-03/)

### Divisions on the Right

[![Steadfast, Business Conservatives Differ over Immigration,
Homosexuality](http://www.people-press.org/files/2014/06/PP-2014-06-26-typology-0-04.png)](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/the-political-typology-beyond-red-vs-blue/pp-2014-06-26-typology-0-04/)The
typology study may have even greater relevance for understanding 2016,
both for the nomination contests and the general election. In both
parties’ electoral coalitions, there are fissures on some of the most
important dimensions in American politics.

On the right, coalitional politics are focused on the Steadfast
Conservatives and Business Conservatives, both of whom lean Republican
by overwhelming margins. Combined they make up about a quarter (27%) of
all registered voters.

Both groups are overwhelmingly white and mostly male; Steadfast
Conservatives are older on average (67% age 50 and older) than Business
Conservatives (53%). And while they represent two clearly different
wings of the party – one more downscale and pessimistic, one more
wealthy and optimistic – both are reliable GOP voting blocs.

Steadfast Conservatives and Business Conservatives agree that government
should be smaller and play less of a role in the economy. They are
unified in their intense opposition to President Obama – fully 94% of
Steadfast Conservatives and 96% of Business Conservatives disapprove of
his job performance. Notably, nearly identical shares of both groups
agree with the Tea Party (55% of Business Conservatives, 53% of
Steadfast Conservatives).

But these conservative groups differ in three important ways on policy
debates that currently divide Republican leaders in Washington.

First, Steadfast Conservatives take very conservative views on key
social issues like homosexuality and immigration, while Business
Conservatives are less conservative – if not actually progressive – on
these issues. Nearly three-quarters of Steadfast Conservatives (74%)
believe that homosexuality should be discouraged by society. Among
Business Conservatives, just 31% think homosexuality should be
discouraged; 58% believe it should be accepted.

Business Conservatives have generally positive attitudes toward
immigrants and 72% favor a “path to citizenship” for those in the U.S.
illegally, if they meet certain conditions. Steadfast Conservatives are
more critical of immigrants; 50% support a path to citizenship, the
lowest share of any typology group.

Second, just as Steadfast Conservatives are opposed to big government,
they also are skeptical of big business. They believe that large
corporations have too much power, and nearly half (48%) say the economic
system unfairly favors powerful interests. By contrast, as their name
suggests, Business Conservatives are far more positive about the free
market, and overwhelmingly regard business – and Wall Street –
positively.

Finally, these two conservative groups differ over foreign policy.
Steadfast Conservatives have doubts about U.S. international engagement
– and view free trade agreements as a bad thing for the U.S. – while
Business Conservatives are more supportive of the U.S. taking an active
role in world affairs and free trade.

### Divisions on the Left

[![Strains in the Democratic Coalition over Morality, Homosexuality,
Expanding the Social Safety
Net](http://www.people-press.org/files/2014/06/PP-2014-06-26-typology-0-05.png)](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/the-political-typology-beyond-red-vs-blue/pp-2014-06-26-typology-0-05/)Solid
Liberals, who constitute 15% of the public and 17% of registered voters,
are the anchor of the Democratic Party’s electoral coalition – the most
avid and loyal voters, holding liberal views across nearly all issues.

But the party must rely on support from the other
Democratically-oriented groups in the typology – the Faith and Family
Left and Next Generation Left – to be successful. While each of these
groups leans Democratic by wide margins, they diverge from
across-the-board liberal thinking in a number of critical ways that have
implications for their loyalty and turnout.

The Faith and Family Left is by far the most racially and ethnically
diverse group in the typology: In fact, just 41% are white non-Hispanic;
30% are black, 19% are Hispanic and 8% are other or mixed race. The
Faith and Family Left also is less affluent and less educated than the
other Democratically-oriented groups, and is older as well.

They also have strong religious convictions, which distinguishes them
from Solid Liberals and the Next Generation Left. Fully 91% say “it is
necessary to believe in God in order to be moral and have good values.”
No more than about one-in-ten in the other Democratically-oriented
groups agree. And the Faith and Family Left have much more conservative
positions on social issues. Just 37% favor same-sex marriage, less than
half the share of the other two groups on the left.

The Faith and Family Left support activist government and a strong
social safety net, though by less overwhelming margins than Solid
Liberals. And while the Faith and Family Left support affirmative action
programs, just 31% believe that “racial discrimination is the main
reason many black people can’t get ahead these days.” Among the much
less racially diverse Solid Liberals, 80% think racial discrimination is
the main barrier to black progress.

The Next Generation Left is the youngest of the typology groups. Roughly
half (52%) are younger than 40, and this segment characterizes the
liberal leanings of the Millennial (and younger Gen X) cohorts: The Next
Generation Left embrace diversity, are generally positive about what
government can do and are relatively upbeat about their own – and the
nation’s – future.

Yet in critical ways, the Next Generation Left have clear differences
with Solid Liberals. While supportive of government, they have a fairly
individualistic take on opportunity and self-achievement. As a result,
they balk at the costs of expanding the social safety net – just 39% say
the government should do more to help needy Americans even if it means
going deeper into debt.

In addition, the Next Generation Left are less skeptical about business
than the other Democratically-oriented groups. While they are no more
likely than Solid Liberals to have investments in the stock market, a
majority of the Next Generation Left (56%) say that Wall Street does
more to help the economy than hurt it, compared with 36% of Solid
Liberals.

### A Pair of Political ‘Wild Cards’: Young Outsiders, Hard-Pressed Skeptics

[![Young Outsiders Share Republicans’ Views on Government, Not Social
Issues](http://www.people-press.org/files/2014/06/PP-2014-06-26-typology-0-06.png)](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/the-political-typology-beyond-red-vs-blue/pp-2014-06-26-typology-0-06/)The
wild cards in the new political typology are the Young Outsiders and the
Hard-Pressed Skeptics. Both groups have weak partisan leanings, which
are reflected in their early preferences in this fall’s midterms: Young
Outsiders favor the Republican candidate, or lean Republican, by a 53%
to 33% margin; Hard-Pressed Skeptics plan to vote Democratic by 51% to
37%.

Whether many will show up at the polls is an open question: They are
less likely than the core partisan typology groups to say they always
vote.

Nonetheless, Young Outsiders may present an attractive opportunity for
the GOP. They are younger and more diverse than Republicans generally.
Nearly half are under 40, compared with just 33% among all Republicans.
Yet Young Outsiders do not feel very favorably toward the GOP; in fact,
nearly as many have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party (34%) as
the Republican Party (39%).

Young Outsiders share Republicans’ deep opposition to increased
government spending on social programs. About three-quarters of Young
Outsiders (76%) say the government can’t afford to spend more to help
the needy.

However, the Young Outsiders’ generational imprint on issues like
homosexuality, diversity and the environment make the Republican Party
an uncomfortable fit. In views of societal acceptance of homosexuality,
for instance, Young Outsiders have more liberal views than the public
overall, and are much more liberal than Republicans.

[![Hard-Pressed Skeptics Critical of Government, But Favor More
Spending](http://www.people-press.org/files/2014/06/PP-2014-06-26-typology-0-07.png)](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/the-political-typology-beyond-red-vs-blue/pp-2014-06-26-typology-0-07/)Similarly,
Hard-Pressed Skeptics have ambivalent views of the Democratic Party and
disagree with Democrats on major issues as often, if not more, as they
agree. Hard-Pressed Skeptics face the most difficult financial
circumstances of any of the typology groups, More than half (56%) have
family incomes of less than $30,000 a year and 67% say they often don’t
have enough money to make ends meet.

In 2012, Hard-Pressed Skeptics say they voted for Obama over Mitt Romney
by more than two-to-one (65% to 25%), but today just 44% approve of the
way Obama is handling his job as president; 48% disapprove.

Hard-Pressed Skeptics are not in sync with mainstream Democratic
thinking in views of Obama’s major policy initiatives – just 40% approve
of the Affordable Care Act. And they take more conservative views on
social issues, such as homosexuality and abortion, than do rank-and-file
Democrats generally.

So why do Hard-Pressed Skeptics remain in the Democrats’ camp, however
marginally? In part, it may be because of their strong support for
increased government social spending. Even though they take a dim view
of government performance, 66% of Hard-Pressed Skeptics say the
government should do more for the needy even if it means adding to the
debt. That is little different from the 61% of all Democrats who favor
more aid for the needy.

And while Hard-Pressed Skeptics are not enthusiastic about the
Democratic Party, in some ways they are even more critical of the GOP.
For instance, about half of Hard-Pressed Skeptics (53%) believe that the
Democratic Party cares about the middle class. But just 26% say the same
about the Republican Party.

### The More Things Change…

The Pew Research Center created its first political typology in
[1987](http://www.people-press.org/1987/09/30/the-people-the-press-politics/),
when President Ronald Reagan was reeling from the Iran-Contra affair and
the front-runners for the upcoming presidential election were Sen. Gary
Hart for the Democrats and Vice President George H.W. Bush for the GOP.

Much has changed in politics over the past 27 years, of course. But some
of the same fissures we identified in that first typology are still
evident today. Today, **Business Conservatives** hold much more liberal
positions on homosexuality and morality than do the other largely
Republican group, **Steadfast Conservatives**. In 1987, **Enterprise
Republicans** were much more tolerant than **Moral Republicans** on many
of the social policy issues of the time, such as whether or not school
boards should have the right to fire homosexual teachers.

On the left today, the majority-non-white **Faith and Family Left** is
highly religious and has much more conservative attitudes about the
acceptability of homosexuality and abortion than do the **Next
Generation Left** or **Solid Liberals**. But this same fissure existed
in the late 1980s between what we then described as the **Partisan
Poor** and **Passive Poor** and the more upscale **60s Democrats**and
**Seculars**.

Every Typology study between 1987 and 2014 has found a very downbeat,
financially stressed group who is skeptical of government, yet supports
the programs that assist people facing economic disadvantages. Over
time, we have referred to them as the **Disaffected**, the
**Embittered** or today the **Hard-Pressed Skeptics**, and their
political leanings have varied with administrations, issues and economic
conditions.

But not all has been constant in the Political Typology, reflecting
changing generational, demographic and political contexts. An anchor of
the Democratic Party in 1987 was the **New Dealers**, representing the
generation raised during economic strife and World War II. With the New
Deal generation largely gone, the Democratic coalition now leans heavily
on the **Next Generation Left**, who are more socially liberal than
their predecessors, but also somewhat more economically conservative.

And the appearance of the **Young Outsiders** is a new group in the
political landscape. Previous typology studies have found right-leaning
groups, such as the **Pro Government Conservatives** in 2005, who proved
critical to George W. Bush’s reelection. Drawn to the GOP coalition by
the party’s positions on security issues and morality, they otherwise
supported a more expansive view of government and social programs. The
**Young Outsiders** today are very different, as they share the GOP
base’s deep skepticism of government programs, but favor a more limited
foreign policy, and hold decidedly liberal social views.

#### About the Study

This is the second report of a multi-part series on political
polarization based on a national survey of 10,013 adults nationwide,
conducted January 23-March 16, 2014 by the Pew Research Center and
funded in part through grants from the William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and
supported by the generosity of Don C. and Jeane M. Bertsch.

The first report, [released June
12](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/),
focused on the nature, scope and trajectory of political polarization in
the American public, and how it interrelates with government, society
and people’s personal lives.

This report uses [cluster analysis to sort people into cohesive
groups](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/appendix-2-about-the-political-typology/),
based on their responses to 23 questions covering an array of political
attitudes and values. First developed in 1987, the Pew Research Center’s
Political Typology has provided a portrait of the electorate at various
points across five presidencies; the last typology study was released in
[May
2011](http://www.people-press.org/2011/05/04/beyond-red-vs-blue-the-political-typology/).

Over the course of 2014, the project will further explore the various
factors that contribute to – or stem from – political polarization. A
September report will examine how political polarization is linked to
people’s information environments: Their news sources, social media
habits and interpersonal communication networks. Other reports will look
at how political polarization relates to where people live, their
political environments, how they view themselves and others around them,
their socioeconomic circumstances, generational changes and broader
sociological and psychological personality traits.

#### About the Data

The data in this report are based on three independent survey
administrations with the same randomly selected, nationally
representative group of respondents. The first is the center’s largest
survey on domestic politics to date: the 2014 Political Polarization and
Typology Survey, a national telephone survey of 10,013 adults, on
landlines and cell phones, from January through March of this year. The
other two surveys involved impaneling subsets of these respondents into
the newly created American Trends Panel and following up with them via
surveys conducted by web, mail and telephone. The surveys are described
in detail in the [About the
Surveys](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/about-the-surveys-25/)
section of the report.
