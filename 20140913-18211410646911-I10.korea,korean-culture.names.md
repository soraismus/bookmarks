### Why so many Koreans are called Kim

A SOUTH KOREAN saying claims that a stone thrown from the top of Mount
Namsan, in the centre of the capital Seoul, is bound to hit a person
with the surname Kim or Lee. One in every five South Koreans is a Kim—in
a population of just over 50m. And from the current president, Park
Geun-hye, to rapper PSY (born Park Jae-sang), almost one in ten is a
Park. Taken together, these three surnames account for almost half of
those in use in South Korea today. Neighbouring China has around 100
surnames in common usage; Japan may have as many as 280,000 distinct
family names. Why is there so little diversity in Korean surnames?

Korea’s long feudal tradition offers part of the answer. As in many
other parts of the world, surnames were a rarity until the late Joseon
dynasty (1392-1910). They remained the privilege of royals and a few
aristocrats (yangban) only. Slaves and outcasts such as butchers,
shamans and prostitutes, but also artisans, traders and monks, did not
have the luxury of a family name. As the local gentry grew in
importance, however, Wang Geon, the founding king of the Goryeo dynasty
(918–1392), tried to mollify it by granting surnames as a way to
distinguish faithful subjects and government officials. The gwageo, a
civil-service examination that became an avenue for social advancement
and royal preferment, required all those who sat it to register a
surname. Thus elite households adopted one. It became increasingly
common for successful merchants too to take on a last name. They could
purchase an elite genealogy by physically buying a genealogical book
(jokbo)—perhaps that of a bankrupt yangban—and using his surname. By the
late 18th century, forgery of such records was rampant. Many families
fiddled with theirs: when, for example, a bloodline came to an end, a
non-relative could be written into a genealogical book in return for
payment. The stranger, in turn, acquired a noble surname.

As family names such as Lee and Kim were among those used by royalty in
ancient Korea, they were preferred by provincial elites and, later,
commoners when plumping for a last name. This small pool of names
originated from China, adopted by the Korean court and its nobility in
the 7th century in emulation of noble-sounding Chinese surnames. (Many
Korean surnames are formed from a single Chinese character.) So, to
distinguish one’s lineage from those of others with the same surname,
the place of origin of a given clan (bongwan) was often tagged onto the
name. Kims have around 300 distinct regional origins, such as the
Gyeongju Kim and Gimhae Kim clans (though the origin often goes
unidentified except on official documents). The limited pot of names
meant that no one was quite sure who was a blood relation; so, in the
late Joseon period, the king enforced a ban on marriages between people
with identical bongwan (a restriction that was only lifted in 1997). In
1894 the abolition of Korea’s class-based system allowed commoners to
adopt a surname too: those on lower social rungs often adopted the name
of their master or landlord, or simply took one in common usage. In 1909
a new census-registration law was passed, requiring all Koreans to
register a surname.

Today clan origins, once deemed an important marker of a person’s
heritage and status, no longer bear the same relevance to Koreans. Yet
the number of new Park, Kim and Lee clans is in fact growing: more
foreign nationals, including Chinese, Vietnamese and Filipinos, are
becoming naturalised Korean citizens, and their most popular picks for a
local surname are Kim, Lee, Park and Choi, according to government
figures; registering, for example, the Mongol Kim clan, or the Taeguk
(of Thailand) Park clan. The popularity of these three names looks set
to continue.

I totally would have shared this article if you hadn't used that pic to
get more views.

Capitalizing on the bodies of women might sell with most of your
viewers, but not with me. The least you could have done is show a woman
with a face.

It's understandable why you would feel this way, but I feel like you're
the one being unknowingly sexist. Why can't he use a picture of women to
show that there's a large amount of koreans with kim and lee in their
names? Would it have been capitalizing on the bodies of men if it was a
male soccer team? I think you're projecting some of your personal angers
onto the author. I'm a Korean male and the first thing I thought after
seeing the picture is, "Oh, he's trying to show that there are many
kim's and lee's in Korea." While you were the one who looked at it and
said, "Omg, it's showing women, this author must be a sexist pig".\
 Am I saying that objectifying women does not exist? No. But, you're
really reaching for it here.

The majority of Koreans (over 90% of the total population) had never
been allowed to have any family name excluding the Yangban, which were
traditional ruling class or nobles of dynastic Korea before the Gabo
Reform taken place between 1894 and 1896 by the strong pressures from
Japan.

Despite its English name, Chinese characters are not only the letters of
China, but they have been used in many Asian countries for thousands of
years. Therefore, not all the Korean surnames are originated from China.
For instance, the surname Park exists only in the two Koreas.

FYI, North Korea and South Korea were both the same country until their
official division in 1953 as a result of the Korean War. Eras like the
Joseon Dynasty far predate the Koreas' division, so both modern
countries developed much in the same way up to the war. As an aside,
think of today's Koreas as a common people governed by very different
governments. Anyway, N. Korean citizens definitely have last names. In
fact, N. Korea's leaders have the last name Kim! As far as the ban on
same last name marriages in N. Korea, I have no clue..

The names on those sports shirts remind me of a Korea story...

Living in Seoul in the mid-90s, my wife and I used to eat regularly at a
restaurant where the waitresses wore name-tags in English with exactly
that same format: family name followed by two initials. One of them read
"No B.S." I have since met other westerners who knew of that place, and
they all remembered her.

If she only knew what a cultural icon she has become...

Yes! It was the Navy Club on the Yongsan base, just south of Nam San.
Best bacon and eggs I've had anywhere, always on a Sunday morn!

Korea was a lot of fun, and it's still my favorite cuisine, all these

Many Chinese are also called Kim,there are 15 kinds of origins by
China's historical records:

A part of Kims people originate in Han,the rest originate in the
Hun,Mogols(Jenghiz Khan and the Mongols'royal family's descendants or
other Mongol's clans),Manchu, Kachin(Jinpo) people,Daur ethnic minority
group,Nüzhen( or Jurchen,an ancient nationality in China),Koguryo

(I'm not sure if the writer/editor reads comments, but hopefully he/she
does)

I think it's worth noting that the concept of surnames in Korea is a bit
different from that of the West. While it is true that on paper, a fifth
of the nation's population share the name surname, in terms of lineage,
that is not the case; Surnames also have a place attached to it. Just as
surnames like Miller or Smith can't be traded back to a single origin,
there are multiple iterations of Kim (and by extension, most other
surnames) that started in different places at different times, by men of
different social standing. There are also cases where disputes create
new branches of the same surname of the same (for lack of a better word)
township, but at hostile standing with one another. Almost all of these
families each keep a book of lineage (usually kept in the eldest son's
house, and passed onto whoever is 'next in line'), and while it's more
of a ceremonial thing these days, like Regina standing in court, almost
all Koreans know which township their family belongs to, including
youngsters like me.

I just wanted to point this out to the author or readers...... hope it
helps! :)

This is a well written article and an excellent effort on a complex
issue. While there are many that share the same family names or
surnames, people with those names aren't from the same ancestors
necessarily. While there are thousands of surnames used in Korea, there
are only about 250 to 300 surnames commonly used in modern North Korea
and South Korea. To put things into perspective, in China, Taiwan,
Singapore and other Chinese speaking countries, there are about 4,000
surnames in use. In Japan, there are hundreds of thousands of surnames
used.

In the Koreas, Kim/Gim/Ghim (김 in Korean, 金 in Chinese and Japanese),
for example, means "gold" or "metal", and has 6 different places of
origins in Korea - 6 different lineages (note the difference from
"clans" which are used to make history fit a specific purpose using
either the paternal or maternal lines), which is also a common name in
both China and Japan. The same is true of Park (and its alternate
spellings, Pak/Bak/Bhak/Baek/Paek) and Lee ( and its alternate
spellings, Yi/I/Rhee/Li/Rhie), have multiple places of origins, and
different ancestors.

Other examples of common Korean surnames and their transliterations:\
 Choi, Choe\
 Jeong, Chung, Jung, Jeng\
 Ju, Joo, Chu, Zhu, Zuu, Juu, Choo\
 Kang, Gang, Ghang\
 Ko, Koh, Go, Goh\
 Mun, Moon, Mon, Munn\
 Yang/Ryang/Liang\
 Yu, Yoo, Liu, Lau, Yau

Here is an interesting listing of East Asian names, their origins,
transliterations, and different pronunciations in Chinese (Mandarin,
Cantonese, Hakka, Minnan, and Gan) and Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese.

For names like Park, there is only one spelling in Korean. The
variations are only when the names are rendered into English (or French,
Dutch, German etc.).

SINCE surnames may not clarify things in Korea, there is some resort to
alternative identification such as biometrics and photography.

Some records such as medical records and x-rays have a tiny face
photograph on the document corner as a definitive identifier.

===

The names may identical, but your face is your unique fingerprint.\
 Perhaps more records should have a photograph id?

Don't worry. First names, which are usually made up of two Chinese
characters or indigenous two-syllabus indigenous Korean words, have much
more diversity enough to minimize the number of people with same names.
Name and D.O.B is enough to identify.

"civil examination ... required all those who sat it to register a

 \> Commoners were allowed to take the civil examination, not just
Yangban, and many did pass.\
 "They could purchase an elite genealogy by physically buying a
genealogical book"\
 \> Family clans realized this, and started centralizing genealogical
books. Also, there are plenty of defunct family clans that you do not
see anymore today (e.g., a number of Kim clans and Cheok).\
 "This small pool of names originated from China"\
 \> Kim and Park do not originate from China.\
 "The popularity of these three names looks set to continue."\
 \> I might be incorrect, but it is to my knowledge that many Chinese
just use the Korean pronunciation of their last names (e.g., Zhou -\>
Ju).

Kim, Park & Lee are all surnames - not chosen, but passed on by
lineage.\
 Mohammad is a given name (first name). Muslims give it to sons in
honour of their religious prophet. Its no different than Latin Americans
calling their son's 'Jesus' or European Catholics calling their
daughters 'Mary'.

In research this is quite awkward. As an editor for a scientific journal
I have to find reviewers for papers that have been submitted. I hardly
ever selected Korean ones, and not too many Chinese either. Trouble is,
it's very hard to distinguish one from another. Just try "Kim
JH"[author] in Pubmed. That yields 12734 publications, in journals as
diverse as "Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology" to "International
Journal of Cardiology" and beyond. How to know one Kim JH from another?

We're all forced to become numbers - Researcher ID, ORCID, etc.
