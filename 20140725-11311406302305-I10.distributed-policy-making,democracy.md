Indonesia's President-Elect Crowdsources His Cabinet

Indonesia's President-elect Joko "Jokowi" Widodo is asking ordinary
people to help him choose his government.

Beawiharta/Reuters/Landov

Indonesia's president-elect is making good on a campaign promise to be a
new kind of leader – starting with his Cabinet, which he's asking
ordinary people to help him choose.

Joko Widodo, also known as Jokowi, was named president on Tuesday
following July 9 polls, the results of which were contested by rival
Prabowo Subianto. In the final count approved by the country's election
commission, Jokowi secured 53 percent to Prabowo's 47 percent.

Volunteers for Jokowi quickly opened an [online survey called the
People's Choice for an Alternative
Cabinet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14sBGBHq82F2ST6b0I8MzQ0db6gXYxygEkO2Xh1iG8G0/viewform)
in which three names are put forward for each of the 34 ministerial
posts, with an option for write-in candidates, [The Wall Street Journal
reports.](http://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2014/07/25/indonesias-new-president-crowdsources-his-cabinet/)

According to WSJ, the introduction of the survey emphasizes that "The
selection of the minister is the prerogative of the President. But that
does not mean people cannot participate."

As of Thursday, some 17,449 people had participated in the survey,
according to a tweet from Jokowi's volunteer network.

> Update, hingga pkl 20.28, ada 17.449 org yg berpartisipasi. Mari
> mengusulkan & memilih menteri kita

>
> — RADIO JOKOWI (@radiojokowi) [July 24,
> 2014](https://twitter.com/radiojokowi/statuses/492300587090731008)

Both Jokowi and Prabowo made extensive use of social media during the
campaign in the country of some 250 million. But, Prabowo, a son-in-law
of long-time dictator Suharto, was seen by many as a throw-back to a
bygone era.

By contrast, Jokowi, is an entrepreneur who "was pressed into politics
by other businessmen wanting to clean up the intricate and dispiriting
regulations that blighted their lives," according to [The Sydney Morning
Herald.](http://www.smh.com.au/world/jokowis-hope-and-change-begins-an-optimistic-chapter-for-indonesias-young-democracy-20140725-zwpmi.html#ixzz38UGSaKh1)

[The Economist says of the new
leader:](http://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2014/07/indonesias-democracy)

> "Jokowi rose up through local government, a product of the
> far-reaching political decentralisation that was introduced after the
> overthrow of Suharto ... in 1999. A former furniture-seller, Jokowi
> was elected mayor of Solo, a medium-sized city in central Java, before
> becoming Jakarta's governor in 2012. He has a reputation for being a
> man of the people.
>
> "Jokowi faces some big challenges. Indonesia's economy, the largest in
> South-East Asia, is slowing. Annual growth fell to 5.2% in the first
> quarter, its slowest rate in more than four years. Wasteful energy
> subsidies are costing the government some $30 billion a year and
> contribute to a destabilising current-account deficit. The sprawling
> bureaucracy needs reform. And the hunt for natural resources is
> ravaging the archipelago's remaining forests and spoiling its seas.
> But Jokowi's most pressing challenge will be to repair the rifts
> caused by the election itself, which has been the most divisive in
> Indonesia's history."
