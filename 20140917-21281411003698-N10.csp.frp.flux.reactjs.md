Hi all,\
\
I seem to remember reading that the dispatcher used in production at
Facebook is synchronous because preventing circular waitFor calls was
too difficult when using promises. Since I use Go-style CSP in my code,
which tends to make problems of this type much easier, I tried my hand
at an asynchronous dispatcher with deadlock prevention.\
\
The code is here:
[https://gist.github.com/odf/ff094c8c796883fba06b](https://gist.github.com/odf/ff094c8c796883fba06b).
I do not have exhaustive tests yet, but believe that the general
approach is sound. If you find a problem, please let me know. I've tried
to explain what happens in the comments, but if something need more
explanation, I'm happy to provide it.\
\
Comments and critique of any kind are obviously very welcome (otherwise
I wouldn't post here). I realise that not everyone will be able to ditch
promises in production and use CSP instead, but even when one uses a
different concurrency paradigm, maybe there's still something useful in
studying how problems like this can be solved with CSP.\
\
Cheers,\
Olaf\

I'm curious, could you elaborate on 'why' promises would make things
harder than CSP?

I'm also curious how it would relate to a stream/signal based approach
such Rx och Bacon?

That's an excellent question. Looking at the code as it is now, I don't
think it would be extremely hard to replace go blocks and yields with
promises and channels with emitters. That's what we basically have under
the surface, anyway. Also, even though I've come across situations where
working with promises got rather unwieldy, I don't think this is one of
them. Still, I doubt that I would have come up with this solution easily
working with promises directly. Why? I think the (somewhat fuzzy) answer
is probably that using CSP directs (restricts) my thinking in certain
ways. Through the use of channels, it offers a small number of well
understood "patterns" of communication between concurrently running
tasks.\
\
For example, the central piece of my dispatcher code is the ability for
a number of tasks to pause until some other task is finished. We don't
want to poll some variable, so the basic idea is to subscribe to some
event. But the other task might already have finished before its our
turn, so we need to check for that, too. It turns out that in Go-style
CSP, pulling from a channel which is closed as soon as the task that's
being waited for is finished has exactly the semantics we need. This is
a well-known pattern, so it took almost zero effort to think of and then
implement that particular piece of functionality.\
\
I think another aspect is that this already has quite a few moving
pieces as is, and it really makes things easier to conceptualise while
developing if I don't have to break up things further into separate
functions wherever I have a "yield" now.\
\
Finally, it is fairly common to get stuck when thinking about a problem
in a certain way, and the solve it easily as soon as one approaches it
differently. So maybe I was just lucky this time. :-)\
\
Regarding your other question, I haven't looked into FRP-style
programming in some time, so I can't really answer that at the moment.\
\
Cheers,\
Olaf

Thanks, makes sense :)

\

Wrt CSP vs FRP maybe it is a difference between data flow and control
flow? Which kind of puts us into the functional vs procedural
trade-offs. And, as you say, this might be the difference between the
ability to compose yieldable actions directly without abstraction.

I've spent some time pondering the FRP question and think that given the
concept of stores as autonomous entities with hidden internal state and
the dispatcher sitting in the middle and playing traffic cop, something
like Rx or Bacon would not be a very good match here. In an FRP system,
I'd imagine one would get rid of stores and dispatcher all together and
manage application state centrally like in Om (or of course Elm).\
\
By the way, I forgot to mention that I cheated a bit in my dispatcher
implementation. The dependency array is shared mutual state between the
various waitFor() instances (or more precisely, the go blocks within),
which is a very un-CSP thing to have. This works here because Javascript
is single-threaded and passing control to other go blocks happens
explicitly via yield, so I can be certain that there are no race
conditions in this particular piece of code. In Go, as far as I
understand, this would not fly. The proper solution would be to have a
separate go routine manage dependencies and communicate with the
waitFor() instances through channels. Or if one insisted on cheating,
one would have to use "nasty" things like locks and mutexes.
