[The Best Tools for UI Hacking (not jsFiddle)](http://williamnewton.co/blog/ui-hacking-in-the-browser/ "Permalink to The Best Tools for UI Hacking (not jsFiddle)")
===================================================================================================================================================================

For designers, the hardest part about programming is setting up your
environment. Or even worse — cloning and setting up an entire project
just so that you can tinker with the code on one element.

For this reason, when I want to make something **fast** using
HTML/CSS/jQuery, — I *always*use an in-browser development environment.
But which should you use? It depends on what you’re trying to do:

Hack From Scratch
=================

You just need to code, fast. Experimenting with a simple layout, design,
or animation:

Benefits:\
 - Ability to download project as a zip\
 - Easy fullscreen modes\
 - Command + Enter shortcut executes your code!

Liveweave is just like jsfiddle, but better. Cleaner, automatic </ \>
element closing, and easy library addition.

Use a Framework or Library
==========================

You want to use bootstrap, jquery, angular, or whatever- use one of
these:

--------------------------------------

Easy to add libraries for bootstrap, jquery, angular, and many more.

--------------------------------------

Plunker lets you edit multiples files, and export them! Set up your next
app in the cloud. Select from popular plunks to kickstart your project
or hack.

Show & Tell
===========

You want to showcase your creation and get feedback from other hackers:

[http://codepen.io/](http://codepen.io)
---------------------------------------

[![Codepen.io Browser
Editor](http://williamnewton.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/codepen.png)](http://codepen.io/williamnewton/pen/Ljhsq)

It’s dribbble for hackers. A jsfiddle social network. You get feedback
like ‘views’ and ‘likes’, users can comment on your pen, and you can
even push URLs to your phone.

There are a lot of options…
---------------------------

Choosing the right editor really is a matter of preference. They all
have little quirks, and some are more friendly to CSS hacking vs jQuery
hacking, etc. Once you find the in-browser editor that’s right for you —
you’ll have nothing holding you back from diving into some code the next
time you get inspired!
