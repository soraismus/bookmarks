### Deep Learning Sentiment Analysis for Movie Reviews using Neo4j

[Sentiment analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis)
uses natural language processing to [extract
features](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection) of a text that
relate to subjective information found in source materials.

### Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

A movie review website allows users to submit reviews describing what
they either liked or disliked about a particular movie. Being able to
mine these reviews and generate valuable meta data that describes its
content provides an opportunity to understand the general sentiment
around that movie in a democratized way. That’s a pretty cool thing if
you think about it. Using machine learning we can democratize
subjectivity about anything in the world. We can make an objective
analysis of subjective content, giving us the ability to better
understand trends around products and services that we can use to make
better decisions as consumers.

### Sentiment Analysis Data Model

One of the major barriers to unlocking this ability is in the way we
structure and transform our data. The current state-of-the-art methods
include approaches such as [Naive
Bayes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier), [Support
Vector Machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine),
and [Maximum
Entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression).
The challenges imposed by these approaches still remains in how features
are extracted from a text and structured as data in a way that is least
costly in terms of performance. I decided to focus on solving the
problem of performance, in the way features are selected and extracted,
and the availability of that data as the number of features grow over
time.

Using a [feature
selection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection) algorithm I
describe
[here](http://www.kennybastani.com/2014/06/hierchical-pattern-recognition.html),
I used the [Graph Database Neo4j](http://www.neo4j.com) to solve the
challenge of data transformation and availability. While the [state of
the art natural language parsing
algorithms](http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/) are focused on sentence
structure, I’ve decided to pursue a statistical approach to [natural
language grammar
induction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar_induction). My approach
focuses on generalizations across a vast corpus of text, generating new
features using [deep
learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) to predict
features with the highest probability of being present to the left or
right of a new feature.

### Graph-based NLP Example

Let's assume that the phrase “**one of the worst**” has been extracted
as a feature of a set of texts. The reason that this phrase was
extracted was that a phrase that it was descended from had determined
that this particular phrase was the most statistically relevant, meaning
that the phrase had the best chance of being matched after the parent
phrase. Using Neo4j we can determine the line of inheritance that
produced this phrase as a feature.

[![image](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-chxX9JlvqE8/VBc12JXqrPI/AAAAAAAAA78/gvzXro5PedA/s640/movie-sentiment-1.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-chxX9JlvqE8/VBc12JXqrPI/AAAAAAAAA78/gvzXro5PedA/s1600/movie-sentiment-1.png)

Starting at the root node, which is captioned as “**{0} {1}**”, the path
in which the phrase “**one of the worst**” will be parsed is
**(the)-\>(of the)-\>(one of the)-\>(one of the worst)**.

The hierarchy reveals more possibilities as you move deeper from “**one
of the worst**”. Expanding the path seen in the image above to include
all possible features that descend from the phrase “**one of the
worst**” reveals the following:

[![image](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8XMgLdZIF-w/VBc2Usjz4rI/AAAAAAAAA8E/LF9kzt1eDlM/s640/movie-sentiment-2.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8XMgLdZIF-w/VBc2Usjz4rI/AAAAAAAAA8E/LF9kzt1eDlM/s1600/movie-sentiment-2.png)

This feature selection algorithm can select on the most statistically
relevant features and phrases extracted from a corpus of text in less
than a second. The reason an approach like this is extremely relevant to
sentiment analysis is that these pattern nodes can be connected to the
label of the text they were trained from, as seen below.

[![image](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6QFCfAxSfcc/VBc2rRhA6rI/AAAAAAAAA8M/eW37Ie6lOe4/s640/movie-sentiment-3.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6QFCfAxSfcc/VBc2rRhA6rI/AAAAAAAAA8M/eW37Ie6lOe4/s1600/movie-sentiment-3.png)

The result of this algorithm, and largely thanks to Neo4j’s graph
traversals, is that any natural language text can be parsed with sub
second performance and generate a subgraph to be used for whichever
classification algorithm makes the most sense for your dataset.

### Open Source Demo

For the movie review example I took 500 movie reviews for both negative
and positive labels and trained a natural language parsing model in
Neo4j using [Graphify](https://github.com/kbastani/graphify). In the
next blog post in this series I will introduce you to a demo that can
perform better at classifying movie reviews than a human. The [human
classification error being 0.3, or 70%
success](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis#Evaluation).

If you’re looking to get your feet wet before then, take a look at the
finished demo here: [Graphify Sentiment Analysis for Movie
Reviews](https://github.com/kbastani/graphify/tree/master/src/examples/graphify-examples-sentiment-analysis)

### Notes

[Neo4j](http://www.neo4j.com) is an open source graph database.

[Graphify](https://github.com/kbastani/graphify) is an open source
extension to Neo4j that extends Neo4j to include classification-based
algorithms for natural language processing.
