![Piet Programming
Language](http://www.bencollier.info/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/Piet_Program_Hello_World%281%29.gif)

Earlier this evening, I was wondering how easy it would be to learn (or
experience) \*every\* programming paradigm out there. I've tried
functional programming, object orientation and so on, but what about
Array Programming, or Reflective Languages? The first one fills me with
terror (thanks to
[APL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_%28programming_language%29)), and
I don't even know what the latter is.

Well, I figured out a way to find a small set of languages which
comprise all programming paradigms. It may not be the \*best\* list, I
banged it together in a hurry, but I certainly found it very
interesting, especially given the results.

But first, here's what I did. I took the lists on Wikipedia of
programming languages arranged by type (which may not be exhaustive, in
fact, I know it's not), and zapped the lists into a spreadsheet. The
next step was to find the language with the most paradigms in it.
[Lua](http://www.lua.org/ "Lua") was the winner here. Then I removed all
the lists of languages which contained Lua from the sheet, and repeated
the exercise. I continued until all the lists had been covered, with a
bit of tweaking and investigation to get rid of categories which didn't
intersect other lists. I also removed things like lists of Educational
and foreign-language-based languages.

Here are the results:

\1) **[Lua](http://www.lua.org/)**: This surprised me when it came out
top. It is an Extension Language, Imperative, runs in Interactive Mode,
is Interpreted, Iterative, features Metaprogramming, is Object-oriented
(single dispatch), Prototype-based, Reflective, can be Aspect-Oriented,
and used for Scripting.

\2) **[Rust]()**: Not even heard of this one. It's is apparently classed
as an Impure Functional Language, is Imperative, used for
Metaprogramming, is Concurrent, Procedural, and Compiled.

\3) **[Curry](http://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/currywiki/)**: I'll
assume from the name that it's a functional language, and it is, a pure
one. But it's also logic-based, concurrent, and uses the off-side rule
(not the football one).

\4) **[Lava](http://raintown.org/lava/)**: The list continues into
obscurity. Here we have a Hardware Description Language for digital
circuit design which is object-oriented, class-based and visual.

\5) **[dBase / xBase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBase)**: Well this
is a blast from the past. It's obviously data-oriented, but is also
apparently a Processing Language, is Declarative, and Fourth Generation.

\6) **[Julia](http://julialang.org/)**: Julia is a mathematical,
high-level, dynamic language. It allows array programming, so you won't
have to soil your hands or mind with APL, and it allows impure
functional programming. It's also object oriented (but with multiple
dispatch this time).

\7) **[Javascript](http://www.ecmascript.org/)**: Embeddable on a web
server on in a browser. The first real appearance of the web in this
list.

**Completing our Education**

So there are still a few gaps in our knowledge. The languages below
round things off. They might only cover one or two paradigms, but they
each do something special (or odd):

\8) **[Piet](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html)**:
Completely nuts. It's an esoteric, stack-based language with a visual
interface which you can use to drive yourself mad. Wonderful.

\9) **[XSLT](http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/)**: Another niche language.
XSLT is a rule-based language for transforming XML, and other markup.

\10)
**[SIGNAL](http://www.irisa.fr/espresso/Polychrony/document/tutorial.pdf)**:
A programming language based on synchronized data-flow, for systems with
several clocks. No doubt enormously useful, if you're working with that
sort of thing.

\11) **[Yacc](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/)**: Yacc is a
syntax handling language. It's a compiler, for compiling compilers.

So there you are. Plough your way through that lot and you ought to
experience the gamut of joys that the programming world has to offer. At
this point, I'd like to throw down the gauntlet to anyone who reckons
that they can find a more compact combination of languages. I'm sure
it's eminently doable. Cleansing the sample data, then using a more
valid algorithm for identifying the smallest set would undoubtedly lead
to better results. I rather like this one though, Piet not withstanding.
