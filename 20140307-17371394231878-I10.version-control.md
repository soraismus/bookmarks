[Version control best practices](/questions/1995854/version-control-best-practices)
===================================================================================

**22**

I just made the move to version control the other day, and after a bad
experience with Subversion, I switched to Mercurial, and so far am happy
with it.

Although I understand and appreciate the idea of version control, I
don't really have any practical experience with it.

Right now, I am using it for a couple websites I am working on, and a
couple questions have come to mind:

-   When/how often should I commit? After any major change, whether it
    works or not? When I'm done for the night? Only when it reaches it's
    next stable iteration? After any bugfixes?
-   Would I branch off when I wanted to, say, change the layout of a
    menu, then merge back in?
-   Should I branch? What is the difference (for just me, a lone
    developer) between branching, then merging back in, and cloning the
    repository and pulling it back in?

Any other advice for a version control newbie?

* * * * *

So far, everyone has given me good advice, but very team-oriented. I
would like to clarify:

At the moment, I am just using VC on some websites I do on the side. Not
quite full-out freelance work, but for the purposes of VC, I am the only
one that really touches the website code.

Also, since I am using PHP on the sites, there is no compiling to be
done.

Does this change your answers significantly?

Most of the questions you're asking about depends mostly on who you are
working with. If you're a lone developer it shouldn't matter a lot,
since you can do whatever you'd like. But if you're in a team where you
have to share your code then you should discuss with your team members
what the *code of conduct* should be since sharing changes between one
another can become tricky at times.

The discussion regarding code of conduct doesn't need to be lengthy, it
can be very brief; as long everyone is on the same page on how to use
the repository that is shared between the programmers in the team. If
you want to use the more advanced features in Mercurial, such as cherry
picking or patch queues, then try using them so that it won't impact
your team members in a negative way, such as rebasing on a public
repository.

Remember version control has to be easy to use for everyone in the team,
or else it won't be used.

While working with a team there are several approaches, but the common
rule is to **commit early and often**. The main reason on why you should
[commit
often](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/107264/how-often-to-commit-changes-to-source-control)
is to make **merge conflicts easier to handle**.

A merge conflict is simply put whenever merging a file that has been
changed by at least two people doesn't work because they've been editing
on the same lines. If you're holding on to a commit that involves a very
large change with several lines of changes across several files, it will
become very difficult to manage for the receiver to manage the conflicts
that may occur. The merge conflict becomes even more difficult to handle
if the said set of changes are held on for too long.

There are some exceptions to the rule of committing often and one is
whenever you have a *breaking change*. although if you have the ability
to commit locally (which you are doing in Mercurial and git inherently)
you could commit breaking changes. As long as you fix whatever broke,
you should push it upstream to the shared repository when you've fixed
your own breaking change.

> Would I branch off when I wanted to, say, change the layout of a menu,
> then merge back in? Should I branch?

There are many [branching
strategies](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000968.html) to
choose from (there is the *Streamed Lines* paper from 1998 that has an
[exhaustive pattern list of branching
strategies](http://www.cmcrossroads.com/bradapp/acme/branching/patterns.html))
and when you're making them for yourself it should be open game for
yourself. However when working in teams, you'd better discuss openly
with the team if you need to branch or not. Whenever you have the urge
to branch though you should ask yourself the following questions:

-   Will my future changes be breaking the work of others?

-   Will my team have a direct negative impact from the changes I'll be
    doing until I'm done?

-   Is my code throwaway code?

If the answer is yes in any of the questions above you should *probably*
branch publically, or keep it for yourself (since you can do that in
Mercurial in several ways). You should first discuss with your team on
how to execute the whole endavour to see if there is any other way of
doing it and if you're going to merge your changes back in, sometimes
there are factors at play where there is no need to branch (this is
mostly related to how modular the code is).

When you decide to branch be prepared to handle a merge conflict. It is
sane to assume the one who created the branch and made the commits to be
able to merge it back into the "main branch". At these times it would be
great if everyone in the team made relevant commit comments.

As a side note: You do write good commit comments, right? RIGHT!? A good
commit comment usually tells **why** that particular change was made or
what feature the committer was working on instead of a nondescript "I
made a commit" kind of comment. This makes it easier for the one who is
handling the big merge conflict to figure out what line changes can be
overwritten and which ones to keep while going through the revision
history.

Compile times, or build times rather, sometimes play into the branch
discussion you may have. If your project has a slow build time then it
might be a good idea to use a staging strategy in your branches. This
strategy takes into account that all developers should integrate to a
"main line" and changes that are approved are elevated (or "promoted")
to the next stage, such as testing or release lines. It is classically
illustrated with tag names for open source software like this:

    main -o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-> ...
             \           \              \
    test      o-----------o--------------o---------> ...
               1.0 RC1     \ 1.0 RC2      2.0 RC1
    release                 o----------------------> ...
                              1.0

The point with this is that testers can work without being interrupted
by the programmers and that there is a known baseline for those who are
in release management. In distributed version control, the different
lines could be cloned repositories and it may look a bit different since
repositories share the versioning graph. The principle however is the
same.

Regarding web development, there are virtually no build times. But
branching in stages (or by tagging your release revisions) it becomes
easier to roll-back if you want to check a difficult-to-track-down bug.

However, a whole other thing comes into play and that is the time it
takes to deploy the site. Version control tools in my experience are
really bad at asset management. Handling art assets that are in total up
to several GB usually is a huge pain in the butt to handle in Subversion
(more so in Mercurial). Assets may require you to handle them in another
way that is less time consuming, such as putting them in a shared space
that are synched and backed up in a traditional manner (art assets are
usually not worked on concurrently as with source code files).

> What is the difference (for just me, a lone developer) between

The concepts of branching and keeping remote repositories are closer now
than with centralized version control tools. You could almost consider
them being the same thing. In Mercurial (and in git) you can "branch"
either by:

-   Cloning a repository

-   Creating a named branch

Creating a named branch means that you're making a *new path in the
versioning graph* for the repository you're creating it on. Creating a
cloned repository means you're copying the source repository into a new
location, and making a *new path* in the cloned repository's *versioning
graph*. They are both two different implementations of branching as a
general concept in version control.

In practice, the only difference between both methods that you should
care about is in usage. You *clone a repository* to have a copy of the
source code and have a place to store your own changes in and you
*create named branches* whenever you want to do small experiments for
yourself.

Since browsing through branches is a bit quirky for those who accustomed
to a straight line of commits, advanced users know how to manipulate
their versions so the version history is "clean" with e.g. [cherry
picking](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/854930/mercurial-cherry-picking-change-sets)
or [rebase](http://blog.bitquabit.com/2008/11/25/rebasing-mercurial/).
At the moment git docs actually explain
[rebase](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) rather well.

These are the practices that I follow

-   Each commit should make sense: one bug fix (or a set of bugs related
    to each other), one (small) new feature, etc. The idea is that if
    you need to rollback, your rollbacks fall on well defined
    "boundaries"

-   Every commit should have a good message explaining what you are
    committing. Really get into this habit, you will thank yourself
    later. Doesn't have to be verbose, a few sentences can do. If you
    are using a bug tracking system, associating a bug number with your
    commit is also extremely helpful

-   Now that I use git and branching is so incredibly fast and cheap, I
    tend to make a new branch for each new feature I'm about to
    implement. I'd never even consider doing this for many other VCSes.
    So branching depends on the system you are using, your codebase,
    your team, etc, there are no hard rules there.

-   I prefer to always use the command line and get to know my VCS's
    commands directly. The disconnect that a GUI based frontend can
    cause can be a pain, and even damaging. Controlling your source code
    is very important, it's worth getting in there and doing it
    directly. But that's just my preference.

-   Back up your VCS. I back up my local repository with Time Machine,
    and then I push out to a remote repository on my server, and that
    server is backed up as well. VCS alone is not really a "backup", it
    can go down too just like anything else.

+1 for one bug/feature per commit. This saves time tracing down if
something comes back and also lets the rest of team easily keep apprised
of *how* you're fixing your issues. â€“ [Peter

> When/how often should I commit?

You'll probably get lots of contradictory answers on this one. My view
is that you should commit changes when they are working, and each commit
(or checkin) should contain exactly one "edit". An "edit" is an atomic
set of changes that go together to fix a bug or implement a new feature.

There is a theory that you should check in code every few hours even if
it's not working, but in that case you will need to be working on your
own branch - you don't want to be checking in broken code to your main
line, or onto a shared branch.

The advantage of checking in every night is that you have backups
(assuming that your repository is on a different machine).

As for branching:

-   you should have main line that contains always working code.
-   you should have a current development branch that contains the
    latest code. When you are happy with this (and it's passed all it's
    tests) you should merge it back into the main line.
-   you might want a branch that contains the last released version.
    This can be used for testing/debugging bugs and releasing patches
    (in extremis).

-   update before each commit
-   provide commit comments
-   commit as soon as you have something finished
-   don't commit anything that makes the code in the repository not
    compiling or buggy
-   update every morning
-   sometimes verbally communicate with colleages if there is something
    important to update
-   commit code relevant to exactly one thing (i.e. fixing a bug,
    implementing a feature)
-   don't worry to make very small commits, as long as they conform to
    the previous rule

Btw, what's the bad experience with Subversion?

Bad experience? While moving a directory up a level, it threw a fit and
stopped half-way, deleting a folder containing most of the site's
content and somehow generating a dozen revisions for just that move. It
took me the better part of a day just trying to reverse that and recover
the data. â€“ [Austin Hyde](/users/130442/austin-hyde "7682 reputation")

Moving directories in subversion is a two step process. You have to
remove the old files and add the new ones. Sometimes this won't work,
one situation is if several devs are working on the files that are
slated for a move but forget to commit. Their changes will then be
magically removed. This is a big grief for agile practitioners who
refactor their code a lot, i.e. move around their code files at times. â€“

I had problems with Subversion when I tried moving classes in C\# to new
namespaces; AnkhSVN corrupted the SVN repository. Corrupted as in the
latest revision in the repo could not be retrieved or be repaired in
anyway, but the old revisions were still working and we couldn't commit
anything new to the repo. This was several years ago, AnkhSVN and later
versions of SVN probably fixed it, but that damaged the confidence I had
in SVN as version control back then. â€“

I commit when I am finished a piece of work and only if it is working.
It's bad practise to commit to somewhere where other people use the
code.

Branching is something that people will argue about. Some people say
never branch and just have switches to get something working or not. Do
what you feel more comfortable but don't branch just because you can. I
use branching and Branch when i am working on a major bit of work where
if I commit broken code by accident its not going to affect everyone
else.

Q: When/how often should I commit? After any major change, whether it
works or not? When I'm done for the night? Only when it reaches it's
next stable iteration? After any bugfixes?

A: Whenever you are feeling comfortable, I am commiting as soon as a
unit of work is finished and working (which does not mean that the
complete task has to be finished). But you should not commit something
that does not compile (might inhibit other people in the team,if any).
Also, you should not commit incomplete stuff to the trunk if there is
any possibility that you have to implement a quick fix or small change
before completing it.

Q: Would I branch off when I wanted to, say, change the layout of a
menu, then merge back in?

A: Only if there is a possibility that you have to implement a quick fix
or small change before completing your task.

The nice thing about branching is that all commits you are doing in the
branch will still be available for future reference (if necessary). Also
it is much simpler and faster than cloning the repo, I think ;-)

I agree with others on commit times.

Regarding branching, I generally branch only when working on something
that breaks what others are doing or when a patch needs to be rolled to
production in a file that already has changes that should not go to
production. If you're only one developer, then the first scenario
doesn't really apply.

I use tags to manage releases - the "production" tag is always
associated with the current prod code, and each release is tagged with
"release-YYYYMMDD". This allows you to roll back if necessary.
