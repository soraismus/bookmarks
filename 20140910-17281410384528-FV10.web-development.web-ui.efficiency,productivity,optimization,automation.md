Delays in performance have the potential to impact user
[engagement](https://twitter.com/igrigorik/status/300226402496704512),
[experience](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/10/pinterest-paint-performance-case-study/)
and [revenue](https://speakerdeck.com/lara/design-for-performance).
Thankfully, Google's 'Make The Web Faster' team recommend a set of
best-practice
[rules](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/rules) for
keeping your pages lean, fast and smooth. These include minifying
resources like CSS and JavaScript, optimizing images, inlining and
removing unused styles and so on.

If you have complete control over your server, an excellent
[PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed)
[Module](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module) for
[Apache](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/download)
and
[Nginx](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/build_ngx_pagespeed_from_source)
exists with filters for many of these tasks. If not however, or you feel
the module isn’t quite for you, a number of build-tasks exist for tools
you’re probably already using to fill in the gaps with more granular
control.

The below represent [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) tasks the Yeoman team regularly use in our
projects. We’ve tried our best to keep this list focused and exclude
previous suggestions which no-longer offer as much value, but there’s
plenty here to help you keep your pages and their resources as small as
possible.

**Note:** Yeoman's [Grunt](http://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp)
and [Gulp](http://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp) webapp
generators include tasks for optimizing images and concatenating and
minifying HTML/CSS/JS. We feel that this provides a healthy baseline,
but this post will cover tasks which go further.

Compress & optimize images
--------------------------

The average web page is now over
[1.5MB](http://httparchive.org/interesting.php?a=All&l=Aug%2015%202013#bytesperpage)
in size, with images responsible for the bulk of this. We aim to keep
our image sizes as lean as possible to reduce the time it takes for a
user to wait for that resource to load.

With the right balance of compression and formatting it's possible to
still ship images as a part of your page whilst minimizing load time as
much as possible. This is really important for users on mobile with
limited data plans or slow connections.

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-contrib-imagemin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin)
-   [grunt-imageoptim](https://github.com/JamieMason/grunt-imageoptim)
    (OSX only)

Why two tasks? Well, here’s an excellent
[breakdown](http://jamiemason.github.io/ImageOptim-CLI) of differences
between the two. Choose the one that is most suitable for you.

#### Gulp

-   [gulp-imagemin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-imagemin)

**Note:** Etsy found that just by
[adding](http://programming.oreilly.com/2014/01/web-performance-is-user-experience.html)
160KB of images to their pages on mobile, their bounce rate increased by
12%. If you can't cut down on the images used in your pages, at least
run them through an optimizer.

Generate responsive images for the `<picture>` element
------------------------------------------------------

If you have a responsive site which is visually flexible on multiple
devices, you'll want a strategy to make images flexible too.

Serving unnecessarily large images to the browser can
[impact](http://timkadlec.com/2013/11/why-we-need-responsive-images-part-deux/)
both rendering and load performance, but these aren't the only metrics
that can suffer when large images are shipped to the browser.

This is one reason we need responsive images, and it's great to see
[srcset](http://blog.chromium.org/2014/02/chrome-34-responsive-images-and_9316.html?m=1)
- hopefully leading to a full implementation of `<picture>` - is already
in Chrome Beta.

There are a number of Grunt tasks available that can help generate
multi-resolution images as part of your build process.

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-responsive-images](https://github.com/andismith/grunt-responsive-images)
    - use this along with
    [Imager.js](https://github.com/BBC-News/Imager.js/), `<picture>` or
    the picturefill [polyfill](https://github.com/jansepar/picturefill).
-   [grunt-clowncar](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-clowncar)

In addition, if you need to just resize/normalize images that are large
in dimension, you can use
[grunt-image-resize](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-image-resize).

**Note:** Tim Kaldec's research into responsive images has
[suggested](http://timkadlec.com/2013/06/why-we-need-responsive-images/)
a responsive images strategy could lead to savings of up to 72% on image
weight. Whilst it is still early to opt for a spec-compatible,
cross-browser approach to responsive images the BBC and Guardian have
been using Imager.js for this successfully.

Minify SVG images
-----------------

SVG files created with editors usually contain a large quantity of
redundant information (metadata, comments, hidden elements and so
forth). This content can be safely removed or converted to a more
minimal form without imacting the final SVG that's being rendered.

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-svgmin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-svgmin)

#### Gulp

-   [gulp-svgmin](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-svgmin)

Generate spritesheets
---------------------

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-spritesmith](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-spritesmith)

#### Gulp

-   [gulp-sprite](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-sprite)

Convert images to WebP
----------------------

WebP is a recent image format that offers lossless and lossy compression
for images on the web. WebP lossless images are up to 26% smaller in
size compared to PNGs and WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller in size
compared to JPEGs. That's quite a saving and thankfully there exist
tasks for encoding to WebP for both Grunt and Gulp.

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-webp](https://github.com/somerandomdude/grunt-webp)

#### Gulp

-   [gulp-webp](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-webp)

**Note:** This
[test](http://www.webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=130125_6N_KZA%2C130125_NH_KZ8&thumbSize=200&ival=100&end=full)
from WebPageTest suggests that compared to JPEG, WebP encoded images
complete loading much quicker due to their smaller filesizes. The Chrome
Web Store
[found](http://www.igvita.com/2013/03/07/faster-smaller-and-more-beautiful-web-with-webp/)
that switching to WebP saw a 30% average saving on bytes, saving them
several terabytes of bandwidth a day.

Build SVG sprites with support for various browsers
---------------------------------------------------

### Grunt

-   [grunticon](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon)

### Gulp

-   [gulp-svgmin](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-svgmin)

We consider inlining images using Data URIs to now be an anti-pattern
given their
[poor](http://www.mobify.com/blog/data-uris-are-slow-on-mobile/)
performance on mobile.

Minify CSS
----------

Minification eliminates unnecessary space, line breaks, indendation and
characters in your files, which are generally unnecessary in production.
Compacting down your HTML, CSS and JS can improve on parsing, execution
and doanload times. For CSS specifically, we recommend:

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-contrib-cssmin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin)

#### Gulp

-   [gulp-cssmin](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-cssmin)

Remove unused CSS
-----------------

In projects using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation and so forth
you typically don’t use the entire kitchen-sink of styles available.
Rather than shipping the full framework to production, use UnCSS to
remove unused styles across your pages. Some developers have seen
anything up to 85% savings in stylesheet filesize.

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-uncss](https://github.com/addyosmani/grunt-uncss)

#### Gulp

-   [gulp-uncss](https://github.com/ben-eb/gulp-uncss)

**Note:** A question developers regularly ask is whether UnCSS, or the
process of removing unused CSS can also work with styles injected into
the page dynamically. The answer is 'yes'. UnCSS works in tandem with
PhantomJS in order to make this happen. Devs have seen anything between
[10](https://twitter.com/efexen/status/438672726996574209)-[120KB](https://twitter.com/thisbetom/status/432575411138998273)
in savings on a typical Bootrap page and UnCSS also works wel with other
frameworks.

Inline CSS
----------

If the external CSS resources for a particular page are small, you can
inline those directly in your markup to save on additional requests.
Inlining small CSS in this way allows the browser to proceed with
rendering the page.

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-inline-css](https://github.com/jgallen23/grunt-inline-css)

#### Gulp

-   [gulp-inline-css](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-inline-css/)

Combine media queries
---------------------

This isn't a PageSpeed recommendation, but allows you to combine
matching media queries into a single media query definition. We've found
it useful for handling CSS generated by preprocessors which may use
nested media queries.

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-combine-media-queries](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-combine-media-queries)

#### Gulp

-   [gulp-combine-media-queries](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-combine-media-queries)

JavaScript
----------

### Minify, compress JS

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-contrib-uglify](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify)
-   [grunt-closure-compiler](https://github.com/gmarty/grunt-closure-compiler)

#### Gulp

-   [gulp-uglify](https://github.com/terinjokes/gulp-uglify)
-   [gulp-closure-compiler](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-closure-compiler)

RequireJS (optimization via r.js)
---------------------------------

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-requirejs](https://github.com/asciidisco/grunt-requirejs)

#### Gulp

-   [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org)

Minify HTML
-----------

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-contrib-htmlmin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-htmlmin)

#### Gulp

-   [gulp-htmlmin](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gulp-htmlmin)

Simple concatenation
--------------------

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-contrib-concat](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat)

#### Gulp

-   [gulp-concat](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-concat)

General compression for files/folders
-------------------------------------

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-contrib-compress](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-compress)

#### Gulp

-   [gulp-zip](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-zip)

Zopfli compression
------------------

The Zopfli Compression Algorithm is an open-source compression library
that generates output typically 3–8% smaller compared to zlib at maximum
compression. It is best suited for apps where data is compressed just
once and then sent over the network lots of times.

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-zopfli](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/grunt-zopfli)

#### Gulp

-   [gulp-zopfli](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-zopfli)

**Note:** When Google Fonts switched to using Zopfli fonts were \~6%
smaller on average, and in some cases up to 15% smaller. According to
[Ilya
Grigorik](https://plus.google.com/+IlyaGrigorik/posts/1sxencNkbNS), for
the case of Open Sans it was more than 10% smaller, translating to
faster rendering and loading times. Zopfli images can however take
longer to decode than JPGs so measure the metrics that matter to you
when deciding whether to use WebP.

Inline Critical path CSS
------------------------

The critical path represents the code and resources needed to render the
"above-the-fold" content in the page - i.e what your users will first
see when they load up your page. PageSpeed recommends inlining your
critical path CSS for improved performance. Whilst tools like
[mod\_pagespeed](https://code.google.com/p/modpagespeed/) are highly
efficient at achieving this, it’s more difficult to optimize for the
critical path with other tooling.

You could probably use PhantomJS along with the above the fold scripts
from [speedreport](https://github.com/r3b/speedreport/) to get an idea
of what CSS is above the fold and can then work on optimizing this
manually.

**Note:** Paul Kinlan wrote a
[bookmarklet](http://addyosmani.com/blog/detecting-critical-above-the-fold-css-with-paul-kinlan-video/)
for estimating the above-the-fold CSS for a page which is also worth
checking out.

Asset pipeline (auto-handle all optimizations)
----------------------------------------------

On the ‘tools to keep an eye on’ list is
[AssetGraph](https://github.com/assetgraph/assetgraph).

AssetGraph looks at projects as a set of graph problems where the nodes
are considered assets (HTML, CSS, Images, JS) and edges, the
relationships between them (image tags, anchor tag, script tags etc).

As AssetGraph can determine how project assets relate to each other it
can perform many of the common performance optimizations developers may
want to achieve on their own automatically. This works particularly well
on smaller projects and support for larger projects is being worked on.

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-reduce](https://github.com/Munter/grunt-reduce)

#### Gulp

Gulp users should just use AssetGraph directly.

Benchmarking
------------

The following benchmarking tasks are useful to integrate as a part of
Continuous Integration. Although the following are currently only
available for Grunt, you can use
[gulp-grunt](https://npmjs.org/package/gulp-grunt) to run Grunt tasks
from Gulp. We recommend:

-   [grunt-pagespeed](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-pagespeed) -
    fantastic for automating checking your PageSpeed score as a part of
    CI.
-   [grunt-topcoat-telemetry](https://github.com/topcoat/topcoat-grunt-telemetry)
    - get smoothness, load time and other stats from Telemetry as part
    of CI. This could help you set up a performance benchmarking
    dashboard similar to the one used by
    [TopCoat](http://bench.topcoat.io/)
-   [grunt-wpt](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-wpt) - CI for
    WebPageTest scores
-   [grunt-phantomas](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-phantomas) -
    response times for requests, responses, time to first image/CSS/JS,
    onDOMReady and more.

Framework Optimization
----------------------

#### Grunt

-   [grunt-ngmin](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-ngmin)
-   [grunt-react](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-react)
-   [grunt-vulcanize](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-vulcanize) -
    excellent for concatenating and flatening Web Components.

#### Gulp

-   [gulp-ngmin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-ngmin)
-   [gulp-react](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-react)
-   [gulp-vulcanize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-vulcanize)

#### Misch

-   [gulp-google-cdn](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-google-cdn)
-   [gulp-size](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-size)

Conclusions
-----------

Delays in performance have the potential to impact user engagement,
experience and revenue. Take time to experiment with the tasks available
for performance optimization, find out what practical gains they can
offer to your projects.

Visitors to your page will be happier as a result of a snappier
experience and a faster web is better for all.
