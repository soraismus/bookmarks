The Lure Of The Unknown Drives Science Forward

We are surrounded by mystery. This may sound like an anti-science
statement but, actually, it's precisely the opposite. We just need to be
careful about how we define mystery or the mysterious. Take Albert
Einstein, for example:

> "The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the
> fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true
> science. He who does not know it and can no longer wonder, is as good
> as dead, a snuffed-out candle."

To Einstein, the mysterious could be equated with the unknown.

As I explore in [my new
book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Island-Knowledge-Science-Meaning/dp/0465031714)
*The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and The Search for
Meaning*, just out, the mysterious need not have anything to do with the
supernatural. It is what is beyond the known.

The essential question, then, is whether what is unknown, or part of it,
is unknowable, beyond our grasp. This question has enormous relevance
for science and for society, as it sets the essential limits to
knowledge: Are there questions about the world and about ourselves that
are unanswerable? What are they?

To answer, we need to examine how science operates. In this space, we
can only scratch the surface.

Science can be seen as a process that amplifies our perception of
reality. Our five senses are like antennae collecting different aspects
of the physical world around us: we see, we hear, we touch, we smell, we
taste. The brain is an amazingly complex entity, capable of [integrating
the
stimuli](http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2014/05/28/316664564/our-brain-the-trickster)
from outside and generating what we call our everyday sense of reality.

On the other hand, we know that our perception of the world is quite
limited: what we see or hear, for example, is a small fraction of what's
actually "out there." It follows that our construction of reality, based
as it is on our five senses, is incomplete. The world is much more than
what we perceive of it.

This is where science makes a triumphal entrance, with its tools of
exploration. They are our *reality amplifiers*, allowing us to see and
measure farther and with more detail, extending our grasp into realms
foreign to our senses. We thus gather information from worlds billions
of light year away, see bacteria and molecules, visualize brain
activity, study elementary particles in a constant dance of creation and
destruction, probe cosmic phenomena that took place near the beginning
of time itself.

We see all this; but we don't see all. We can't.

Every tool of exploration has a range and a set precision. With a good
pair of binoculars, we can see almost as well as Galileo with his
telescope of 1610. We see craters and mountains on the moon, the four
largest moons of Jupiter, etc. But we don't see galaxies. For that, we
need bigger telescopes. And even those have their limits. We will always
see more of nature, but never enough.

We will never see everything there is to see.

There is a persistent veil around our perception of reality, the mystery
that surrounds us. This mystery, as Einstein remarked, has tremendous
seductive power and has inspired some of the greatest works of art,
science and literature. Fortunately, it won't go away.

Apart from technological limitations to how much we can see of reality,
nature itself offers barriers to knowledge: the speed of light implies
that we live literally within a bubble of information, our "cosmic
horizon," with size equal to the distance light has travelled since the
Big Bang. The universe most probably continues beyond the horizon; but
we can't get information from "out there." The uncertainty principle at
the heart of quantum mechanics, that so undid Einstein, is not going
away either: there is a fundamental *unknowability* deep at the heart of
matter. Even math and computer science have fundamental incompleteness
problems. And understanding consciousness ...

But we can get back to these another day. For now, let's stay with the
metaphor of the Island of Knowledge: the more it grows, the more grow
the shores of our ignorance, the boundaries between the known and the
unknown.
