Promises are a great solution to address complexities of asynchronous
requests and responses. AngularJS provides Promises using services such
as `$q` and `$http`; other services also use promises, but I will not
discuss those here.

Promises allow developers to easily attach *1x-only notifications of
response* to any asynchronous request/action. Promises also enable two
(2) other very important things. We can:

-   Transform the responses before subsequent handlers (in the chain)
    are notified of the response.
-   Use the response to invoke more async requests (which could generate
    more promises).

But even more important than the features above, Promises support easy
**chaining** of custom activity or computations. Managing sequences or
chains of asynchronous activity can be a very difficult and complex
effort. Promise chains are **amazing** and provide means to easily build
sequences of asynchronous requests or asynchronous activity.

> …and we will also discuss the some of hidden anti-patterns

Below I explore and discuss the hidden power in chain promises. Or your
can simply watch the **egghead.io Video Tutorial**:

[![chaining-promises

* * * * *

### The FlightDashboard

Consider the Travel Service shown which loads information about the
user’s upcoming travel departure. Below our *service* shows how a a
remote web service by returns a JSON data file… Remember that data calls
are asynchronous and our TravelService request generates **a promise to
respond** when the information is loaded.

~~~~ {.brush: .jscript; .title: .; .notranslate title=""}
  var TravelService = function( $http )
      {
        return {
          getDeparture : function( user )
          {
            return $http.get (
              URL_LAST_FLIGHT,
              { userID : user.email }
            );
          }
        };
      }
~~~~

Now let’s use this service from a `FlightDashboard` to load the user’s
scheduled flight:

~~~~ {.brush: .jscript; .title: .; .notranslate title=""}
var FlightDashboard = function( $scope, user, travelService )
    {
      travelService
        .getDeparture( user )
        .then( function( departure )
        {
          // Publish the departure details to the view
          $scope.departure = departure;
        });
#
      $scope.departure = null;
    };
~~~~

> Okay this is nice… but nothing shockingly new is shown here. So let’s
> add some \`real-world\` complexity.

* * * * *

### Nesting Promise Chains

Now let’s assume that once we have flight details, then we will also
want to check the weather forecast and the flight status.

The scenario here is a cascaded 3-call sequence: `getDeparture()` -\>
`getFlight()` -\> `getForecast()`

![sequential
chaining](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/210413/1777753/2e351326-682a-11e3-844a-d3583486f558.jpg)

~~~~ {.brush: .jscript; .title: .; .notranslate title=""}
var FlightDashboard = function( $scope, user, travelService, weatherService )
    {
        // Level 1
#
        travelService
            .getDeparture( user.email )                 // Request #1
            .then( function( departure )                // Response Handler #1
            {
                $scope.departure = departure;
#
                // Level 2
#
                travelService
                    .getFlight( departure.flightID )        // Request #2
                    .then( function( flight  )              // Response Handler #2
                    {
                        $scope.flight = flight;
#
                        // Level 3
#
                        weatherService
                            .getForecast( departure.date )      // Request #3
                            .then( function( weather )          // Response Handler #3
                            {
                                $scope.weather = weather;
                            });
                    });
            });
    };
~~~~

Notice how the success handler for getFlight() is passed the flight
object. And the success handler for getForecast() is passed the weather
object… both of which are published to the scope.

The above implementation uses deep-nesting to create a sequential,
cascading chain of three (3) asynchronous requests; requests to load the
user’s departure, flight information, and weather forecast.

* * * * *

### Flattened Promise Chains

While this works, deep nesting can quickly become difficult to manage if
each level has non-trivial logic. Promise chain nesting also requires
developers to careful consider how they will manage errors within the
chain segments.

I personally consider deep nesting to be an **anti-pattern**.
Fortunately we can restructure the code for errors, clarity, and
maintenance. Here we leverage the fact that a promise handler can
return:

-   A value – that will be delivered to subsequent resolve handlers
-   A **promise** – that will create a branch queue of async activity
-   A exception – to reject subsequent promise activity
-   A rejected promise – to propagate rejections to subsequent handlers

Since promise handlers can **return Promises**, let’s use that technique
to refactor a new implementation:

~~~~ {.brush: .jscript; .title: .; .notranslate title=""}
var FlightDashboard = function( $scope, user, flightService, weatherService )
    {
        travelService
            .getDeparture( user )                                           // Request #1
            .then( function( departure )
            {
                $scope.departure = departure;                               // Response Handler #1
                return travelService.getFlight( departure.flightID );       // Request #2
            })
            .then( function( flight )
            {
                $scope.flight = flight;                                     // Response Handler #2
                return weatherService.getForecast( $scope.departure.date ); // Request #3
            })
            .then( function( weather )
            {
                $scope.weather = weather;                                   // Response Handler #3
            });
#
        $scope.flight     = null;
        $scope.planStatus = null;
        $scope.forecast   = null;
    };
~~~~

The important change here is to notice that the response handler
**returns** a Promise. See how the handler for `getDeparture()` returns
a promise for `getFlight()`? And the success handler for `getFlight()`
which returns a promise for `getForecast()`.

> Remember that success handlers can either (a) return the response
> value, (b) throw an exception, or (c) return a \*\*Promise\*\*

This is a good example of a flattened **promise chain** approach. But I
do not like this solution because I had to create my **success**
handlers as function wrappers that essentially only call another
promise-returning API. It would be great if I could eliminate those
*tedious* function wrappers… which seem like an unnecessary, extra
layers!

* * * * *

### Better Refactors

What else can we do? What if we viewed each request-response as a
self-contained process? Then we could chain processes…

~~~~ {.brush: .jscript; .title: .; .notranslate title=""}
    var FlightDashboard = function( $scope, user, travelService, weatherService )
        {
            var loadDeparture = function( user )
                {
                    return travelService
                            .getDeparture( user.email )                     // Request #1
                            .then( function( departure )
                            {
                                $scope.departure = departure;               // Response Handler #1
                                return departure.flightID;
                            });
                },
                loadFlight = function( flightID)
                {
                    return travelService
                            .getFlight( flightID )                          // Request #2
                            .then( function( flight )
                            {
                                $scope.flight = flight;                     // Response Handler #2
                                return flight;
                            });
                },
                loadForecast = function()
                {
                    return weatherService
                            .getForecast( $scope.departure.date )           // Request #3
                            .then(function( weather )
                            {
                                $scope.weather = weather;                   // Response Handler #3
                                return weather;
                            });
                };
#
            loadDeparture( user )<br />
                .then( loadFlight )
                .then( loadForecast );
#
            $scope.user       = user;
            $scope.departure  = null;
            $scope.flight     = null;
            $scope.weather    = null;
        };
~~~~

Now we have three (3) intuitively-named functions: `loadDeparture()`,
`loadFlight()`, and `loadForecast()`… all chained together in a flat
chain; each segment of the *chain* is now a self-contained, named
function.

~~~~ {.brush: .jscript; .title: .; .notranslate title=""}
#
    loadDeparture( user )
        .then( loadFlight )
        .then( loadForecast );
#
~~~~

Each of these functions internally makes a service call, gets a promise,
and attaches a success handler to the promise. And Each handler
publishes something to the scope.

But two other VERY important things are now happening:

\1) Returning Promises instead of data objects:

Notice that each of the chain segments (loadDeparture, loadFlight,
loadWeather) returns a Promise. The important thing to realize here is
the instead of returning a data object, we are returning another
promise. Returning promises allows use to build chains where each
segment is only resolved when the promise at the segment resolves… and
that promise could itself represent a subchain. While a segment is
waiting for its promise to resolve or reject… all the remaining segments
in the chain are waiting… and in fact, those segments have not even been
called yet.The async requests in subsequent segments are queued and have
not even been called yet. This is promise chaining. This is very
powerful.

\2) Success handlers return data values:

Notice that the internal Promise success handler of each segment returns
a value… a value that may be passed as an argument value when invoking
the next segment of the promise chain. See how the first segment
`loadDeparture()` returns the `flightID`… which is passed as an argument
when invoking the call to `loadFlight()`? And While `loadFlight()`
returns the `flight` object, the next segment `loadWeather()` ignores
that value.

This flattened-promise chain is now really easy to understand and
manage.

An anti-pattern issue still exists here. This solution has that one (1)
funky **hack**:

Notice how the weather service had to use `$scope.departure.date` within
its `getForecast()` call. `loadWeatherForecast()` can only directly
receive a `flight` argument… and it does not have direct access to the
`flight` reference.

* * * * *

### Finally

Finally, we should consider the dependencies of each segment of the
*chain*. Notice that not all of our requests have to be sequential [and
thus wait for all previous segments to finish first]. In our scenario,
the Flight and Weather service calls could be requested in parallel
[independent of each other].

![parallel
chaining](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/210413/1777751/2c3e687e-682a-11e3-83a9-f04f488a028c.jpg)

We will use the `$q.all()` and the `$q.spread()` methods to condense our
code and centralize all `$scope` changes.

~~~~ {.brush: .jscript; .title: .; .notranslate title=""}
var FlightDashboard = function( $scope, user, travelService, weatherService, $q, $log )
    {
        var loadFlight = function( user )
            {
                return travelService.getDeparture( user.email );               // Request #1
            },
            parallelLoad = function ( departure )
            {
                // Execute #2 & #3 in parallel...
#
                return $q.all([
                        travelService.getFlight( departure.flightID ),         // Request #2
                        weatherService.getForecast( departure.date  )          // Request #3
                    ])
                    .then( $q.spread( function( flight, weather )
                    {
                        $scope.departure   = departure;                        // Response Handler #1
                        $scope.flight      = flight;                           // Response Handler #2
                        $scope.weather     = weather;                          // Response Handler #3
#
             // Let's force an error to demonstrate the reportProblem() works!
#
                        throw( new Error("Just to prove catch() works! ") );
                    }));
            },
            reportProblems = function( fault )
            {
                $log.error( String(fault) );
            };
#
#
        // 3-easy steps to load all of our information...
        // and now we can include logging for of problems within ANY of the steps
#
        loadFlight( user )
            .then( parallelLoad )
            .catch( reportProblems );
#
    };
~~~~

The last version is very clean and terse. I simplified even further AND
I also added a **exception handler**!

### Summary

Hopefully I have shown you some elegant and sophisticated techniques for
chaining promises. The above chain can easily become even more
complicated:

![TreeOfChains](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/210413/1750919/afbfb5a4-65be-11e3-93d6-b5b61865bd0b.jpg)

But even these complicated chains are easy to manage with the techniques
that I have demonstrated.

And if this somewhat trivial example does not convince you… check out a
real-world refactor of the Dash.js class [DownloadRules
Gist](https://gist.github.com/ThomasBurleson/7576083). The refactor is a
Gist source with a conversation thread discussing the tradeoffs and
considerations.

You will have to decide whether you want to nest or flatten your promise
chains. Just note that all of these approaches are simply techniques of
**chaining functions** that either request more asynchronous activity or
*handle* their async responses.

Flattening Promise Chains

    Thanks for the article, I was following it in order to learn best
    practices when dealing with promises, and I find it brilliant.\
     However, while trying to write code similar to yours, I stumbled
    into a problem: the promise returned by $q.all will contain the
    AGGREGATED data from the previous requests.

    Thus, in my parallelLoad implementation (in which I don’t use
    spread) flight will contain all the data, while weather will be
    undefined.

    I don’t understand if I am making some kind of mistake, if this is
    due to the spread call, or if it was simply your error. Could you
    clarify the matter for me?

        Ok, I just understood now the meaning of the comment below:

        “I was using the $q.spread() example simply to show how one can
        gather\` all promise results and deliver them as named arguments
        to a group fulfillment handler.”

        I expected this to be default behavior, it should be implemented
        like this in angular.\
         Thank you anyway, I’ll leave here my question for reference.

    Further to the last comments, how can you call getFlight and
    getWeather in parallel (after successful getDeparture call), but
    handle them independantly, such that a successful return immediately
    updates $scope and a failure in one does not ignore a success in the
    other?

    Good post but I don’t think you should use the parallel load in your
    final solution.

    Rather, wire everything together explicitly, eg

    ` departureP = getDeparture(...) departureP.then(getFlight) departureP.then(getWeather)`

    This expresses the dependencies elegantly and simply without having
    to declare the parallel execution explicitly but through the magic
    of promises the flight and weather will still load in parallel.

        Did my example shown just previous [to the `$q.spread()`
        example] not do what you mentioned in your comments?\
         BTW, I was using the `$q.spread()` example simply to show how
        one can **gather**\` all promise results and deliver them as
        **named** arguments to a group fulfillment handler.

    Great post

    I already knew promises, but the spread part has been very usefull
    for a refactor i had in mind. Thanks

    This is great.\
     Just to make sure I understand, in your $q.spread() you assign
    departure, flight, weather to the $scope. Am I correct to assume
    that if either travelService.getFlight \*or\*
    weatherService.getForecast fails, then \*nothing\* is assigned to
    the scope? Quoting Q: “The spread function “spreads” the values over
    the arguments of the fulfillment handler. The rejection handler will
    get called at the first sign of failure”. As you pointed out, both
    services are independent and certainly can/should be called in
    parallel, but if you can’t get the weather, wouldn’t you still want
    to be able to display the flight info?

        @Sebastien,\
         Very good point and TRUE. My `$q.spread()` will not resolve
        unless all the specified promises resolve.\
         For some scenarios this *risk* is allowable… but the developer
        should certainly be aware of such code flows.
