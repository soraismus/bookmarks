### Why Concatenative Programming Matters

Introduction\
 \
 There doesn’t seem to be a good tutorial out there for concatenative
programming, so I figured I’d write one, inspired by the classic “Why
Functional Programming Matters” by John Hughes. With any luck it will
get more people interested in the topic, and give me a URL to hand
people when they ask what the heck I’m so excited about.\
 \
 Foremost, there seems to be some disagreement over what the term
“concatenative” actually means. [This Stack Overflow
answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2792941/role-of-combinators-in-concatenative-tacit-programming-languages/2795529#2795529)
by Norman Ramsey even goes so far as to say:\

> “…it is not useful to use the word ‘concatenative’ to describe
> programming languages. This area appears to be a private playground
> for [Manfred von Thun](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/phimvt/). There is no
> real definition of what constitutes a concatenative language, and

This is rather harsh, and, well, wrong. Not entirely wrong, mind, just
rather wrong. But it’s not surprising that this kind of misinformation
gets around, because concatenative programming isn’t all that well
known. (I aim to change that.)\
 \
 Concatenative programming is so called because **it uses function
*composition* instead of function *application***—a non-concatenative
language is thus called *applicative*. That’s the defining difference,
and it’s as “real” a definition as I need, because, well, it’s the one
that people are using. Bang. Descriptivism.\
 \
 One of the problems with functional programming is that the oft-touted
advantages—immutability, referential transparency, mathematical purity,
&c.—don’t *immediately* seem to apply in the real world. The reason “Why
Functional Programming Matters” was necessary in the first place was
that functional programming had been mischaracterised as a paradigm of
negatives—no mutation, no side-effects—so everybody knew what you
*couldn’t* do, but few people grasped what you *could*.\
 There is a similar problem with concatenative programming. Just look at
the Wikipedia introduction:\

> A concatenative programming language is a point-free programming
> language in which all expressions denote functions and the
> juxtaposition of expressions denotes function composition. The
> combination of a compositional semantics with a syntax that mirrors
> such a semantics makes concatenative languages highly amenable to
> algebraic manipulation.

This is all true—and all irrelevant to your immediate problem of *why
you should care*. So in the next sections, I will show you:\

-   How concatenative programming works
-   How typing in a concatenative language works
-   How concatenative languages are efficient
-   What concatenative languages are *not* good for
-   Where to go for more information

\
 Now let’s get started!\
 \

♦ ♦ ♦

\
 The Basics\
 \
 In an applicative language, functions are applied to values to get
other values. λ-calculus, the basis of functional languages, formalises
application as “β-reduction”, which just says that if you have a
function (f x = x + 1) then you can substitute a call to that function
(f y) with its result (y + 1). In λ-calculus, simple juxtaposition (f x)
denotes application, but function composition must be handled with an
explicit composition function:\

> compose := λf. λg. λx. f (g x)

This definition says “the composition (compose) of two functions (f and
g) is the result of applying one (f) to the result of the other (g x)”,
which is pretty much a literal definition. Note that this function can
only be used to compose functions of a single argument—more on this
later.\
 \
 **In concatenative languages, composition is implicit**: “f g” is the
composition of f and g. However, this does not mean that function
application becomes explicit—it actually becomes *unnecessary*. And as
it turns out, this peculiar fact makes these languages a whole lot
simpler to build, use, and reason about.\
 \
 The untyped λ-calculus is a relatively simple system. However, it and
the many systems derived from it still need three kinds of
term—variables, lambdas, and applications—as well as a number of rules
about how to correctly replace variable names when applying functions.
You have to deal with name binding, closures, and scope. For a
supposedly low-level language, it has quite a bit of inherent
complexity.\
 \
 Concatenative languages have a much simpler basis—**there are *only*
functions and compositions**, and evaluation is just the
*simplification* of functions. It is never necessary to deal with named
state—there are no variables. In a sense, concatenative languages are
“more functional” than traditional functional languages! And yet, as we
will see, they are also easy to implement efficiently.\
 \
 \

♦ ♦ ♦

\

Composition\
 \
 Let’s say we want to multiply a couple of numbers. In a typical
concatenative language, this looks like:\

> 2 3 ×

There are two weird things about this.\
 First, we use postfix notation (2 3 ×) rather than the prefix notation
(× 2 3) that is common in the functional world, or the infix notation (2
× 3) that most languages provide for convenience. There is nothing
*stopping* a concatenative language from having infix operators, but for
the sake of consistency, most stick to postfix notation: “f g” means (g
∘ f), i.e., the *reverse* of function composition. This is actually
rather nice notation, because it means that **data flows in the order
the functions are written in.**\
 \
 Second, we said all terms denote functions—so what the heck are 2 and 3
doing in there? They sure look like values to me! But if you tilt your
head a little, you can see them as functions too: **values take no
arguments and return themselves**. If we were to write down the inputs
and outputs of these functions, it would look like this:\

> 2 :: () → (int)\
>  3 :: () → (int)

As you may guess, “x :: T” means “x is of type T”, and “T~1~ → T~2~”
means “a function from type T~1~ to type T~2~”. So these functions take
no input, and return one integer. We also know the type of the
multiplication function, which takes two integers and returns just one:\

> × :: (int, int) → (int)

Now how do you compose all of these functions together? Remember we said
“f g” means the (reverse) composition of f and g, but how can we compose
2 with 3 when their inputs and outputs don’t match up? You can’t pass an
integer to a function that takes no arguments.\
 \
 The solution lies in something called *row polymorphism*. Basically, we
can give a generic, *polymorphic* type to these functions that says
they’ll take *any* input, followed by what they actually need. They
return the arguments they don’t use, followed by an actual return
value:\

> 2 :: ∀A. (A) → (A, int)\
>  3 :: ∀A. (A) → (A, int)\
>  × :: ∀A. (A, int, int) → (A, int)

“∀A.” means “For all A”—in these examples, even if A has commas in it.
So now the meaning of the expression “2 3” is clear: it is a function
that takes no input and returns *both* 2 and 3. This works because when
we compose two functions, we match up the output of one with the input
of the other, so we start with the following definitions:\

> 2 :: ∀A. (A) → (**A, int**)\
>  3 :: ∀B. (**B**) → (B, int)

We match up the types:\

> (**A, int**) = (**B**)

By substituting, we get a new polymorphic type for 3 within the
expression:\

> 3 :: ∀C. (**C, int**) → (**C, int**, int)

This matches the non-polymorphic type:\

> 3 :: ∀A. (**A, int**) → (**A, int**, int) = ∀B. **B** → (**B**, int)

So the final type of the expression becomes:\

> 2 3 :: ∀A. (A) → (A, int, int)

Going through the same process for multiplication, we get:\

> 2 3 :: ∀A. (A) → (A, int, int)\
>  × :: ∀B. (B, int, int) → (B, int)\
>  A = B\
>  2 3 × :: ∀A. (A) → (A, int)

This is correct: the expression “2 3 ×” takes no input and produces one
integer. Whew! As a sanity check, note also that the equivalent function
“6” has the same type as “2 3 ×”:\

> 6 :: ∀A. (A) → (A, int)

So already, concatenative languages give us something applicative
functional languages generally can’t: we can ***actually* return
multiple values from a function, not just tuples.** And thanks to row
polymorphism, we have a uniform way to compose functions of different
types, so the flow of data in our programs doesn’t get obscured, as it
were, by the plumbing.\
 \

♦ ♦ ♦

\
 Cool Stuff\
 \
 In the above example, we worked from left to right, but because
composition is associative, you can actually do it in any order. In math
terms, (f ∘ g) ∘ h = f ∘ (g ∘ h). Just as “2 3 ×” contains “2 3”, a
function returning two integers, it also contains “3 ×”, a function that
returns thrice its argument:\

> 3 × :: (int) → (int)

(From now on I’ll omit the ∀ bit from type signatures to make them
easier to read.)\
 \
 So we can already trivially represent partial function application. But
this is actually a huge win in another way. Applicative languages need
to have a defined associativity for function application (almost always
from left to right), but here we’re free from this restriction. A
compiler for a statically typed concatenative language could literally:\

1.  Divide the program into arbitrary segments
2.  Compile every segment *in parallel*
3.  Compose all the segments at the end

This is impossible to do with any other type of language. **With
concatenative programming, a parallel compiler is a plain old
map-reduce!**\
 \
 Because all we have are functions and composition, a concatenative
program is a *single function*—typically an impure one with side
effects, but that’s by no means a requirement. (You can conceive of a
pure, lazy concatenative language with side-effect management along the
lines of Haskell.) Because a program is just a function, you can think
about composing programs in the same way.\
 \
 **This is the basic reason Unix pipes are so powerful:** they form a
rudimentary string-based concatenative programming language. You can
send the output of one program to another (`|`); send, receive, and
redirect multiple I/O streams (`n<`, `2&>1`); and more. At the end of
the day, a concatenative program is all about the flow of data from
start to finish. And that again is why concatenative composition is
written in “reverse” order—because it’s *actually forward*:\
 \

    +---+
    | 2 |
    +---+
      |
      |   +---+
      |   | 3 |
      |   +---+
      |     |
      V     V
    +---------+
    | *       |
    +---------+
      |
      V

\

\

Implementation\
 \
 So far, I have deliberately stuck to high-level terms that pertain to
all concatenative languages, without any details about how they’re
actually implemented. One of the very cool things about concatenative
languages is that while they are inherently quite functional, they also
have a very straightforward and efficient imperative implementation. In
fact, concatenative languages are the basis of many things you use every
day:\

-   The **Java Virtual Machine** on your PC and mobile phone
-   The **CPython** bytecode interpreter that powers BitTorrent,
    Dropbox, and YouTube
-   The **PostScript** page description language that runs many of the
    world’s printers
-   The **Forth** language that started it all, which still enjoys
    popularity on embedded systems

The type of a concatenative function is formulated so that it takes any
number of inputs, uses only the topmost of these, and returns the unused
input followed by actual output. These functions are essentially
operating on a list-like data structure, one that allows removal and
insertion only at one end. And any programmer worth his salt can tell
you what that structure is called.\
 \
 **It’s a stack.** Yep. Just a stack.\
 \
 Consider the information flowing between functions in the expression “2
3 × 4 5 × +”, which, if you’re not up on your postfix, is equal to (2 ×
3 + 4 × 5):\
 \

Function

Output

\

()

2

(2)

3

(2, 3)

×

(6)

4

(6, 4)

5

(6, 4, 5)

×

(6, 20)

+

(26)

\
 Moving from left to right in the expression, whenever we encounter a
“value” (remember: a nullary self-returning function), we push its
result to the stack. Whenever we encounter an “operator” (a non-nullary
function), we pop its arguments, perform the computation, and push its
result. Another name for postfix is [reverse Polish
notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation), which
achieved great success in the calculator market on every HP calculator
sold between 1968 and 1977—and many thereafter.\
 \
 So a concatenative language is a functional language that is not only
easy, but *trivial* to run efficiently, so much so that **most language
VMs are essentially concatenative.** x86 relies heavily on a stack for
local state, so even C programs have a little bit of concatenativity in
’em, even though x86 machines are register-based.\
 \
 Furthermore, it’s straightforward to make some very clever
optimisations, which are ultimately based on simple pattern matching and
replacement. The [Factor](http://factorcode.org/) compiler uses these
principles to produce very efficient code. The JVM and CPython VMs,
being stack-based, are also in the business of executing and optimising
concatenative languages, so the paradigm is *far* from unresearched. In
fact, a sizable portion of all the compiler optimisation research that
has ever been done has involved virtual stack machines.\
 \

♦ ♦ ♦

\
 Point-free Expressions\
 \
 It is considered good functional programming style to write functions
in *point-free* form, omitting the unnecessary mention of variables
(*points*) on which the function operates. For example, “f x y = x + y”
can be written as “f = (+)”. It is clearer and less repetitious to say
“f is the addition function” than “f returns the sum of its two
arguments”.\
 \
 More importantly, it’s more meaningful to write what a function *is*
versus what it *does*, and point-free functions are more succinct than
so-called “pointful” ones. For all these reasons, point-free style is
generally considered a Good Thing™.\
 \
 However, if functional programmers *really* believe that point-free
style is ideal, they shouldn’t be using applicative languages! Let’s say
you want to write a function that tells you the number of elements in a
list that satisfy a predicate. In Haskell, for instance:\
 \

    countWhere :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Int
    countWhere predicate list = length (filter predicate list)

\
 It’s pretty simple, even if you’re not so familiar with Haskell.
`countWhere` returns the `length` of the list you get when you `filter`
out elements of a `list` that don’t satisfy a `predicate`. Now we can
use it like so:\
 \

    countWhere (>2) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] == 3

\
 We can write this a couple of ways in point-free style, omitting
`predicate` and `list`:\
 \

    countWhere = (length .) . filter
    countWhere = (.) (.) (.) length filter

\
 But the meaning of the weird repeated self-application of the
composition operator (`.`) isn’t necessarily obvious. The expression
`(.) (.) (.)`—equivalently `(.) . (.)` using infix syntax—represents a
function that composes a *unary* function (`length`) with a *binary*
function (`filter`). This type of composition is occasionally written
`.:`, with the type you might expect:\
 \

    (.:) :: (c -> d) -> (a -> b -> c) -> a -> b -> d
    (.:) = (.) . (.)

    countWhere = length .: filter

\
 But what are we *really* doing here? In an applicative language, we
have to jump through some hoops in order to get the basic concatenative
operators we want, and get them to typecheck. When implementing
composition in terms of application, **we must explicitly implement
every type of composition.**\
 \
 In particular, there is no uniform way to compose functions of
different numbers of arguments or results. To even get close to that in
Haskell, you have to use the `curry` and `uncurry` functions to
explicitly wrap things up into tuples. No matter what, you need
different combinators to compose functions of different types, because
Haskell doesn’t have row polymorphism for function arguments, and it
*inherently can’t.*\
 \
 Writing point-free expressions demands concatenative semantics, which
just aren’t natural in an applicative language. Now contrast a
concatenative example:\
 \

    define countWhere [filter length]
    (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) [2 >] countWhere

\
 It’s almost painfully literal: “to count the number of elements in a
list that match a predicate is to filter it and take the length”. In a
concatenative language, there is no need at all for variables, because
all you’re doing is building a machine for data to flow through:\
 \

    +-----------------+
    | (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) |
    +-----------------+
        |
        |               +-------+
        |               | [2 >] |
        |               +-------+
        |                 |
    +---|-----------------|-----+
    |   |    countWhere   |     |
    |   V                 V     |
    | +-----------------------+ |
    | | filter                | |
    | +-----------------------+ |
    |   |                       |
    |   V                       |
    | +--------+                |
    | | length |                |
    | +--------+                |
    |   |                       |
    +---|-----------------------+
        |
        V

\
 When you’re building a diagram like this, just follow a few simple
rules:\

1.  Each block is one function
2.  A block takes up as many columns as needed by its inputs or outputs,
    whichever are more
3.  When adding a block, put it in the rightmost column possible:
    -   If it takes no inputs, add a column
    -   If there aren’t enough arrows to match the block, the program is
        ill-typed

\

Quotations\
 \
 Notice the use of brackets for the predicate [2 \>] in the preceding
example? In addition to composition, the feature that completes a
concatenative language is *quotation*, which allows *deferred*
composition of functions. For example, “2 \>” is a function that returns
whether its argument is greater than 2, and [2 \>] is a function that
returns “2 \>”.\
 \
 It’s at this point that we go meta. While just *composition* lets us
build descriptions of dataflow machines, *quotation* lets us build
machines that *operate on descriptions of other machines*. Quotation
eliminates the distinction between code and data, in a simple, type-safe
manner.\
 \
 The “filter” machine mentioned earlier takes in the *blueprints* for a
machine that accepts list values and returns Booleans, and filters a
list according to the instructions in those blueprints. Here’s the type
signature for it:\

> filter :: (list T, T → bool) → (list T)

There are all kinds of things you can do with this. You can write a
function that applies a quotation to some arguments, without knowing
what those arguments are:\

> apply :: ∀A B. (A, A → B) → (B)

You can write a function to compose two quotations into a new one:\

> compose :: ∀A B C. (A → B, B → C) → (A → C)

And you can write one to convert a function to a quotation that returns
it:\

> quote :: (T) → (() → T)

\

♦ ♦ ♦

\
 The Dark Side\
 \
 Say you want to convert a math expression into concatenative form:\

> f x y z = y^2^ + x^2^ − |y|

This has a bit of everything: it mentions one of its inputs multiple
times, the order of the variables in the expression doesn’t match the
order of the inputs, and one of the inputs is ignored. So we need a
function that gives us an extra copy of a value:\

> dup :: (T) → (T, T)

A function that lets us reorder our arguments:\

> swap :: (T~1~, T~2~) → (T~2~, T~1~)

And a function that lets us ignore an argument:\

> drop :: (T) → ()

From the basic functions we’ve defined so far, we can make some other
useful functions, such as one that joins two values into a quotation:\

> join~2~ :: (T~1~, T~2~) → (() → (T~1~, T~2~))\
>  join~2~ = quote swap quote swap compose

Or a function that rotates its three arguments leftward:\

> rot~3~ :: (T~1~, T~2~, T~3~) → (T~2~, T~3~, T~1~)\
>  rot~3~ = join~2~ swap quote compose apply

And hey, thanks to quotations, it’s also easy to declare your own
control structures: \
 \

    define true  [[drop apply]]      # Apply the first of two arguments.
    define false [[swap drop apply]] # Apply the second of two arguments.
    define if    [apply]             # Apply a Boolean to two quotations.

\
 And using them is like—actually, just *is*—using a regular function:\
 \

    ["2 is still less than 3."]    # "Then" branch.
    ["Oops, we must be in space."] # "Else" branch.
    2 3 <                          # Condition.
    if print                       # Print the resulting string.

\
 Those particular definitions for `true` and `false` will be familiar to
anyone who’s used Booleans in the λ-calculus. A Boolean is a quotation,
so it behaves like an ordinary value, but it contains a binary function
that chooses one branch and discards another. “If-then-else” is merely
the application of that quotation to the particular branches.\
 \
 Anyway, getting back to the math, we already know the type of our
function ((int, int, int) → (int)), we just need to deduce how to get
there. If we build a diagram of how the data flows through the
expression, we might get this:\
 \

       +---+  +---+  +---+
       | x |  | y |  | z |
       +---+  +---+  +---+

         |     x^2    |y|
         |      |      |
         |      V      V
         |    +----------+
         |    | -        |
         |    +----------+
         |   x^2-|y|
         |      |
         V      V
       +----------+
       | +        |
       +----------+
    y^2+x^2-|y|
         |
         V

So our final function can be written:\

> f = drop dup dup × swap abs rot~3~ dup × swap − +

Well…that sucked.\

\
 A Lighter Note\
 \
 You’ve just seen one of the major problems with concatenative
programming—hey, every kind of language has its strengths and
weaknesses, but most language designers will lie to you about the
latter. **Writing seemingly simple math expressions can be difficult and
unintuitive,** especially using just the functions we’ve seen so far. To
do so exposes all of the underlying complexity of the expression that
we’re accustomed to deferring to a compiler.\
 \
 [Factor](http://factorcode.org/) gets around this by introducing a
facility for lexically scoped local variables. Some things are simply
more natural to write with named state rather than a bunch of
stack-shuffling. However, the vast majority of programs are not
predominated by mathematical expressions, so in practice this feature is
not used very much:\

> “Out of 38,088 word and method definitions in the source code of
> Factor and its development environment at the time of this writing,
> 310 were defined with named parameters.”—[Factor: A Dynamic
> Stack-based Programming
> Language](http://factorcode.org/littledan/dls.pdf)

One of the great strengths of concatenative languages, however, is their
ability to refactor complex expressions. Because every sequence of terms
is just a function, you can *directly* pull out commonly used code into
its own function, without even needing to rewrite anything. There are
generally no variables to rename, nor state to manage.\
 \
 So in practice, a lot of expressions can be refactored using a wide
array of handy functions, of the sort that commonly end up in a standard
library. With some refactoring, that math expression might look like
this:\

> square = dup ×\
>  f = drop [square] [abs] bi − [square] dip +

Which doesn’t look so bad, and actually reads pretty well: the
difference between the square and absolute value of the second argument,
plus the square of the first. But even that description shows that our
mathematical language has evolved as inherently applicative. It’s better
sometimes just to stick to tradition.\
 \

♦ ♦ ♦

\
 Whither Hence\
 \
 So you’ve got the gist, and it only took a few dozen mentions of the
word “concatenative” to get there. I hope you’re not suffering from
semantic satiation.\
 \
 You’ve seen that concatenative programming is a paradigm like any
other, with a *real definition* and its own pros and cons:\
 \

-   Concatenative languages are simple and consistent (“everything is
    a”)
-   They are amenable to dataflow programming
-   Stack languages are well studied and have good performance
-   You can easily roll your own control structures
-   Everything is written in point-free style (for better or worse)

\
 If you’re interested in trying out a mature, practical concatenative
language, check out [Factor](http://www.factorcode.org/) and the
[official blog](http://factor-language.blogspot.com/) of the creator,
Slava Pestov. Also see [Cat](http://www.cat-language.com/) for more
information on static typing in concatenative languages.\
 \
 I’ve been idly working on a little concatenative language called
[Kitten](http://github.com/evincarofautumn/kitten) off and on for a
while now. It’s dynamically typed and compiles to C, so you can run it
just about anywhere. I wanted a language I could use for a site on a
shared host where installing compilers was irritating. That shows you
the extent of my language geekery—I’d rather spend hours writing a
language than twenty minutes figuring out how to install GHC on
Bluehost.\
 \
 Anyway, the implementation is *just barely* complete enough to play
around with. Feel free to browse the source, try it out, and offer
feedback. You’ll need GHC and GCC to build it, and I imagine it works
best on Linux or Unix, but there shouldn’t be any *particularly*
horrible incompatibilities.\
 \
 This would also be a good time to mention that I’m working on a more
serious language called Magnet, which I mentioned in my last article
about how [programming is
borked](http://evincarofautumn.blogspot.com/2012/01/yep-programming-is-borked.html).
It’s principally concatenative, but also has applicative syntax for
convenience, and relies heavily on the twin magics of pattern matching
and generalised algebraic data types. Hell, half the reason I wrote this
article was to provide background for Magnet. So expect more articles
about that.\
 \
 **Edit (20 April 2013)** The above information is no longer accurate.
Kitten is currently being rewritten; the work that was done on Magnet
has been incorporated. Kitten is now statically typed and, until the
compiler is complete, interpreted.\
 \
 And that about does it. As always, feel free to email me at
[evincarofautumn@gmail.com](mailto:evincarofautumn@gmail.com) to talk at
length about anything. Happy coding!
