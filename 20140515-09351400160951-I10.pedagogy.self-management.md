In interviews, famous people often say that the key to becoming both
happy and successful is to “do what you love.” But mastering a skill,
even one that you deeply love, requires a huge amount of drudgery. Any
challenging activity—from computer programming to playing a musical
instrument to athletics—requires focused and concentrated practice. A
perfect golf swing or flawless butterfly stroke takes untold hours of
practice (actually around 10,000 hours, [according to Malcolm
Gladwell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book))) and countless
repetitions to perfect.\

Anyone who wants to master a skill must run through the cycle of
practice, critical feedback, modification, and incremental improvement
again, again, and again. Some people seem able to concentrate on
practicing an activity like this for years and take pleasure in their
gradual improvement. Yet others find this kind of focused,
time-intensive work to be frustrating or boring. Why?\

The difference may turn on the ability to enter into a state of
“[flow](books.google.ca/books?isbn=0061876720),” the feeling of being
completely involved in what you are doing. Whether you call it being “in
the zone,” “in a groove,” or something else, a flow state is a special
experience. Since [Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi](http://www.cgu.edu/pages/4751.asp) developed the
concept of flow in the 1970’s, it has been a mainstay of
positive-psychology research. Flow states can happen in the course of
any activity, and they are most common when a task has well-defined
goals and is at an appropriate skill level, and where the individual is
able to adjust their performance to clear and immediate feedback.\

Flow states turn the drudgery of practice into an [autotelic
activity](#v=onepage&q=optimal%20experience%20studies%20of&f=true)—that
is, one that [can be enjoyed for its own
sake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation),
rather than as a means to an end or for attaining some external reward.
That raises the question of how we can turn this to our advantage: How
can we get into a flow state for an activity that we want to master, so
that we enjoy both the process of improving skills and the rewards that
some with being a master?\

Csikszentmihalyi suggested that those who most readily entered into flow
states had an “[autotelic
personality](http://www.uni-trier.de/fileadmin/fb1/prof/PSY/PGA/bilder/Baumann_Flow_Chapter_9_final.pdf)”—a
disposition to seek out challenges and get into a state of flow. While
those without such a personality see difficulties, autotelic individuals
see opportunities to build skills. Autotelic individuals are receptive
and open to new challenges. They are also persistent and have low levels
of self-centeredness. Such people, with their capacity for
“disinterested interest” (an ability to focus on tasks rather than
rewards) have a great advantage over others in developing their innate
abilities.\

Fortunately for those of us who aren’t necessarily blessed with an
autotelic personality, there is evidence that flow states can be
facilitated by environmental factors. In particular, the learning
framework prescribed by Montessori schools seems to encourage flow
states. A [comparison of Montessori middle schools with traditional
middle schools](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/428885) (co-written
by Csikszentmihalyi) found that the Montessori students showed greater
affect, higher intrinsic motivation, and more frequent flow experiences
than their counterparts in traditional schools. In Montessori schools,
learning comes through discovery rather than direct instruction,
students are encouraged to develop individual interests, and a great
deal of unstructured time is built into the day so that they can pursue
these interests. Competition is discouraged and grading is
de-emphasized, taking the focus off of external rewards. Students are
grouped together according to shared interests, rather than segregated
by ability.\

While there isn’t (yet) a pill that can turn mundane practice into a
thrilling activity for anyone, it is heartening that we seem, at least
to some degree, to be able to nudge ourselves toward flow states. By
giving ourselves unstructured, open-ended time, minimal distractions,
and a task set at a moderate level of difficulty, we may be able to love
what we’re doing while we put in the hard work practicing the things we
love doing.
