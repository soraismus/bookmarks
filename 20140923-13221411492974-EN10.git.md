[Git: inverse cherry-pick?](/questions/1624705/git-inverse-cherry-pick)
=======================================================================

Suppose I have this feature branch "foo". Now I want to merge it back
into master, but I've added some debugging code that I don't want in
master.

The debug code is in it's own commit, so I could use `git cherry-pick`
on each commit and leave out this commit. But that's gonna be quite
tiresome.

Is there some "inverse cherry-pick" that does this? or an interactive
merge?

How can I do this in an easy way?

Use interactive rebase:

    git rebase -i SHA-OF-FIRST-COMMIT-IN-BRANCH

That will open something like this in your $EDITOR:

        pick 8ac4783 folders and folders
        pick cf8b1f5 minor refactor
        pick 762b37a Lots of improvement. Folders adn shit.
        pick 3fae6e1 Be ready to tableview
        pick b174dc0 replace folder collection view w/ table view
        pick ef1b65b more finish
        pick ecc407f responder chain and whatnot
        pick 080a847 play/pause video
        pick 6719000 wip: movie fader
        pick c5f2933 presentation window fade transition

        # Rebase e6f77c8..c5f2933 onto e6f77c8
        #
        # Commands:
        #  p, pick = use commit
        #  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
        #  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
        #
        # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
        # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
        #

So what you do is simply to remove the line containing the debug commit,
write the file and close your editor, and git will tell you something
along the lines of:

    Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/master.

Now you can just merge in that branch to master.

UPDATE: It should be noted that altering history with `rebase` should
*only* happen on private branches. If this branch has been exposed to
the public, use `git revert` as proposed by other answerer.

Despite what other SCMs use it to mean, in `git`, `git revert` is an
inverse cherry-pick.

`git revert` does record a new commit with the appropriate changes
removed. – [Mike Mazur](/users/2576/mike-mazur "1605 reputation") Oct 26

@mikem: which is, I think, what an inverse cherry-pick intuitively
means. Both `revert` and `cherry-pick` also have a `-n` option which
doesn't perform a commit but leaves the changes in the
cache/index/staging area so the commands are very similar. – [Charles

Another idea is to add the reverted commit of the one with debug code
and to merge it into your master branch. Afterwards we remove that extra
commit in the foo branch.

    git checkout foo
    git revert COMMIT_REF_WITH_DEBUG_CODE

    git checkout master
    git merge foo

    git checkout foo
    git reset --hard HEAD~1

Make sure your working tree is clean. First create the reverted commit.
Then merge it into master. Afterwards reset the branch pointer of the
foo branch to the parent of the reverted commit, so it's back in its
original state.

If you dislike using `git reset` then you could create a temporary
branch where you create the reverted commit. At the end you delete the
temporary branch.

Use interactive rebase to remove the commits which you do not want.

On a new branch "foo-merge" created from "foo":

    git rebase -i master

Once you are in commit edit mode, remove the lines containing the debug
commits, save, and quit from the editor.

After rebasing, simply pull foo-merge into master:

    git checkout master
    git pull . foo-merge

A little difficult to contribute via comments when you're not allowed
