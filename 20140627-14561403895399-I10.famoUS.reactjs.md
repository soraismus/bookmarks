One of the privileges (or curses) of experience is that you amass a
growing number of cautionary tales with which you can bore your younger
audience to death. On the other hand, knowing the history of slavery
came in handy for Captain Pickard to recognize that what Federation was
trying to do by studying Data is [create an army of
Datas](http://www.jammersreviews.com/st-tng/s2/measure.php), not
necessarily benefit the humanity. So experience can come in handy once
in a while.

So let’s see if my past experience can inform a topic *de jour*.

**AWT, Swing and SWT**

The first Java windowing system (AWT) was based on whatever the
underlying OS had to offer. The original decision was to ensure the same
Java program runs anywhere, necessitating a ‘least common denominator’
approach. This translated to UIs that sucked equally on all platforms,
not exactly something to get excited about. Nevertheless, they embraced
the OS, inheriting both the shortcomings and receiving the automatic
improvements.

The subsequent Swing library took a radically different approach,
essentially taking on the responsibility of rendering everything. It was
‘fighting the OS’, or at least side-stepping it by creating and
controlling its own reality. In the process, it also became responsible
for keeping up with the OS. The Eclipse project learned that fighting
the OS is trench warfare that is never really ‘won’. Using an
alternative system ([SWT](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/)) that accepted
the windowing system of the underlying OS turned out to be a good
strategic decision, both in terms of the elusive ‘look and feel’, and
for riding the OS version waves as they sweep in.

**The 80/20 of custom widgets**

When I was working on the Eclipse project, I had my own moment of
‘sidestepping’ the OS by implementing [Eclipse
Forms](http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Forms/article.html).
Since browsers were not ready yet, I wrote a rudimentary engine that
gave me text reflows, hyperlinks and images. This widget was very useful
when mixed with other normal OS widgets inside Eclipse UI. As you could
predict, I got the basic behavior fairly quickly (the ’80′ part). Then I
spent couple of years (including help from younger colleagues), doing
the ‘last mile’ (the ’20′) – keyboard, accessibility, BIDI. It was never
‘finished’ and it was never quite as good as the ‘real’ browser, and not
nearly as powerful.

One of the elements of that particular custom widget was managing the
layout of its components. In essence the container was managing a
collection of components but the layout of the components was delegated
to the layout manager that could be set on the container. This is an
important characteristic that will come in handy later in the article. I
remember the layout class as one of the trickiest and hardest to get
done right and fully debug. After it was ‘sort of’ working correctly,
everybody dreaded touching it, and consequently forgot how it worked.

**DOM is awesome**

I gave you this Abe Simson moment of reflection to set the stage for a
battle that is raging today between people who want to work with the
browser’s DOM, and people who think it is the root of all evil and
should be worked around. As is often these days, both points of view
came across my twitter feed from different directions.

In the ‘embrace the DOM’ corner, we have the [Web
Components](http://css-tricks.com/modular-future-web-components/)crowd,
who are thinking that DOM is just fine. In fact, they want us to expand
it to turn it into a universal component model (instead of buying into
the ‘bolt on’ component models of widget libraries). I cannot wait for
it: I always hated the barrier of entry for Web libraries. In order to
start reusing components today, you first need to buy into the bolt-on
component model (not unlike needing to buy another set top box in order
to start enjoying programming from a new content provider).

‘Embracing the DOM’ means a lot of things, and in a widely retweeted
article by Reto Schläpfer about React.js, he argued that the current
MV\* client side framework treat DOM as the view, managing data event
flow ‘outside the DOM’. Reto highlights the example of React.js library
as an alternative, where the DOM that already manages the layout of your
view can be pressed into double-duty of serving as the ‘nervous system’.

This is not entirely new, and has been used successfully elsewhere. I
wrote previously on[DOM event
bubbling](http://dejanglozic.com/2013/11/23/beam-my-model-up-scotty/ "Beam My Model Up, Scotty!")used
in Bootstrap that we used successfully in our own code. Our realization
that with it we didn’t feel the need for MVC is now echoed by React.js.
In both cases, layout and application events (as opposed to data events)
are fused – layout hierarchy is used as a scaffolding for the event
paths to flow, using the build-in DOM behavior.

For completeness, not all people would go as far as claim that React.js
obviates the need for client-side MVC – for example, Backbone.js has
been shown to [play nicely with
React.js](http://joshbassett.info/2014/reactive-uis-with-react-and-bacon/).

**DOM is awful**

In the other corner are those that believe that DOM (or at least the
layout part of it) is broken beyond repair and should be sidestepped. My
micro-service *camarade de guerre* [Adrian
Rossouw](https://twitter.com/AdrianRossouw)seems to be quite smitten
with the [Famo.us](http://famo.us/)framework. This being Adrian, he
approached this is the usual comprehensive way, [collecting all the
relevant
articles](http://wayfinder.co/pathways/5365c71219e552110093ba31/graft-io-full-stack-node-js-through-microservices)using
wayfinder.co (I am becoming increasingly spoiled/addicted to this way of
capturing Internet wisdom on a particular topic).

Studying Famo.us is an archetype of a red herring – while its goal is to
allow you build beautiful apps using JavaScript, transformations and
animation, the element relevant to this discussion is that they sidestep
DOM as the layout engine. You create trees and use transforms, which
Famo.us uses to manage the DOM as an implementation detail, mostly as a
flat list of nodes. Now recall my Abe Simpson story about SWT containers
and components – doesn’t it ring similar to you? A flat list of
components and a layout manager on top of it controlling the layout as
manifestation of a [strategy
pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern).

Here is what Famo.us has to say about they approach to DOM for layouts
and events:

> If you inspect a website running Famo.us, you’ll notice the DOM is
> very flat: most elements are siblings of one another. Inspect any
> other website, and you’ll see the DOM is highly nested. Famo.us takes
> a radically different approach to HTML from a conventional website. We
> keep the structure of HTML in JavaScript, and to us, HTML is more like
> a list of things to draw to the screen than the source of truth of a
> website.
>
> Developers are used to nesting HTML elements because that’s *the* way
> to get relative positioning, event bubbling, and semantic structure.
> However, there is a cost to each of these: relative positioning causes
> slow page reflows on animating content; event bubbling is expensive
> when event propagation is not carefully managed; and semantic
> structure is not well separated from visual rendering in HTML.

They are not the only one with ‘the DOM is broken’ message. Steven
Wittens in his [Shadow DOM](http://acko.net/blog/shadow-dom/)blog post
argues a similar position:

> Unfortunately HTML is crufty, CSS is annoying and the DOM’s unwieldy.
> Hence we now have libraries like React. It creates its own virtual DOM
> just to be able to manipulate the real one—the Agile Bureaucracy
> design pattern.
>
> The more we can avoid the DOM, the better. But why? And can we fix it?
>
> ……
>
> CSS should be limited to style and typography. We can define a real
> layout system next to it rather than on top of it. The two can combine
> in something that still includes semantic HTML fragments, but wraps
> layout as a first class citizen. We shouldn’t be afraid to embrace a
> modular web page made of isolated sections, connected by reference
> instead of hierarchy.

**Beware what you are signing up for**

I would have liked to have a verdict for you by the end of the article,
but I don’t. I feel the pain of both camps, and can see the merits of
both approaches. I am sure the ‘sidestep the DOM’ camp can make their
libraries work today, and demonstrate how they are successfully
addressing the problems plaguing the DOM in the current browser
implementations.

But based on my prior experience with the sidestepping approach, I call
for caution. I will also draw on my experience as a father of two. When
a young couple goes through the first pregnancy, they focus on the first
9 months, culminating in the delivery. This focus is so sharp and
short-sighted that many of the couples are genuinely bewildered when the
hospital hands them their baby and kicks them to the hospital entrance,
with newly purchased car seat safely secured in the back. It only dawns
on them at that point that baby is forever – that the bundle of joy is
now their responsibility for life.

With that metaphor in mind, I worry about taking over the DOM’s
responsibility for layout. Not necessarily for what it means today, but
couple of years down the road when both the standards and the browser
implementations inevitably evolve. Will it turn into a trench warfare
that cannot be won, a war of attrition that drains resources and results
in abandoned libraries and frameworks?

Maybe I can figure that one out after a nap.
