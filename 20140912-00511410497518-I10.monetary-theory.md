The Ripple logo

**Ripple** is a [payment system](/wiki/Payment_system "Payment system"),
[currency
exchange](/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market "Foreign exchange market") and
[remittance](/wiki/Remittance "Remittance") network by [Ripple
Labs](/wiki/Ripple_Labs "Ripple Labs"). It is built upon a
[distributed](/wiki/Distributed_computing "Distributed computing"),
[open source](/wiki/Open_source "Open source") internet
[protocol](/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol"), consensus
ledger and native currency called ripples (XRP). The Ripple network
purports to enable "secure, instant and nearly free global financial
transactions of any size with no chargebacks". It supports any [fiat
currency](/wiki/Fiat_currency "Fiat currency")
([dollars](/wiki/Dollars "Dollars"), [yen](/wiki/Yen "Yen"), etc.),
[cryptocurrency](/wiki/Cryptocurrency "Cryptocurrency")
([bitcoin](/wiki/Bitcoin "Bitcoin"),
[litecoin](/wiki/Litecoin "Litecoin"), etc.),
[commodity](/wiki/Commodity "Commodity") or other unit of value
(frequent flier miles, mobile minutes,
etc.).^[[1]](#cite_note-1)^^[[2]](#cite_note-ripple-is-http-2)^

At its core, Ripple is based around a shared, public database or ledger.
In addition to balances, the ledger holds information about offers to
buy or sell currencies and assets, creating the first distributed
exchange. Participants in the network agree to changes in the ledger via
a process called consensus which is reached every 2–5 seconds. The
consensus process allows for payments, exchanges and remittance without
the need for a centralized clearing house.^[[3]](#cite_note-3)^ The
consensus ledger makes the Ripple network energy efficient and robust
against attacks compared to cryptocurrencies like
[Bitcoin](/wiki/Bitcoin "Bitcoin") that are secured by
mining.^[[4]](#cite_note-buterin-26-sep-2013-4)^

As of September 26, 2013, the Ripple [reference server and
client](/wiki/Reference_implementation "Reference implementation") are
[free software](/wiki/Free_software "Free software"), released under the
terms of the [ISC
License](/wiki/ISC_License "ISC License").^[[4]](#cite_note-buterin-26-sep-2013-4)^
The current release of the client is version 0.2.48-3 and the server
(known as rippled) is version 0.24.0^[[5]](#cite_note-5)^

History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ripple_(payment_protocol)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ripple was first implemented in 2004 by Ryan
Fugger,^[[6]](#cite_note-buterin2013-6)^^[[7]](#cite_note-7)^ a Web
developer in Vancouver, B.C., Canada.^[[8]](#cite_note-peck2013-8)^ In
2005, Fugger began to build Ripplepay as a financial service to provide
secure payment options to members of an online community via a global
network.^[[8]](#cite_note-peck2013-8)^^[[9]](#cite_note-9)^

This led to the development of a new Ripple system in 2011 by Jed
McCaleb.^[[8]](#cite_note-peck2013-8)^ It was designed to eliminate
Bitcoin's reliance on centralized exchanges, use less electricity than
Bitcoin, and perform transactions much more quickly than
Bitcoin.^[[8]](#cite_note-peck2013-8)^ OpenCoin Inc. was founded in 2012
when McCaleb added Chris Larsen to the
project.^[[10]](#cite_note-bloomberg-10)^^[[11]](#cite_note-grant2013-11)^
Larsen previously founded lending services companies
[E-Loan](/wiki/E-Loan "E-Loan") and
[Prosper](/wiki/Prosper_Marketplace "Prosper Marketplace"), and McCaleb
previously created the [eDonkey
network](/wiki/EDonkey_network "EDonkey network") and founded Bitcoin
exchange [Mt.
Gox](/wiki/Mt._Gox "Mt. Gox").^[[11]](#cite_note-grant2013-11)^ On
September 26, 2013, OpenCoin Inc. changed its name to [Ripple Labs
Inc.](/wiki/Ripple_Labs "Ripple Labs"),^[[10]](#cite_note-bloomberg-10)^
and released the source code for Ripple's peer-to-peer node software,
called rippled, as [open
source](/wiki/Open_source "Open source").^[[4]](#cite_note-buterin-26-sep-2013-4)^

Concept[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ripple_(payment_protocol)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Concept")]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Ripple, users make payments between themselves by using
cryptographically signed transactions denominated in either Ripple's
internal currency named XRP or in arbitrary other assets (including
real-world assets such as dollars, gold, air miles etc.). For
XRP-denominated transactions Ripple can make use of its internal ledger.
For payments denominated in all other assets, the Ripple ledger only
records the amounts owed by one user to another. In this way, all these
assets are represented as debt. Since Ripple only keeps the records in
its ledger and has no real-world enforcement power, this requires trust.
Users have to specify which other users they trust and to what maximum
amount. This can be specified for each asset type individually.

When a non-XRP payment is made between two users that trust each other,
the balance of the mutual credit line is adjusted, subject to limits set
by each user. In order to send assets between users that have not
directly established a trust relationship, the system tries to find a
path between the two users such that each link of the path is between
two users that do have a trust relationship. All balances along the path
are then adjusted simultaneously and
[atomically](/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems) "Atomicity (database systems)").^[[6]](#cite_note-buterin2013-6)^
This mechanism of making payments through a network of trusted
associates is named 'rippling'. It is a digital version of the age-old
[hawala](/wiki/Hawala "Hawala") system^[[12]](#cite_note-12)^ and has
been referred to as 'Facebook for money'.

Gateways[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ripple_(payment_protocol)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Gateways")]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A gateway is any person or organization that enables users to put money
into and take money out of the Ripple
network.^[[4]](#cite_note-buterin-26-sep-2013-4)^ They accept currency
deposits from users and issue balances into Ripple’s distributed ledger.
Furthermore, gateways redeem ledger balances against the deposits they
hold when currency is withdrawn. In practice, gateways are similar to
banks, yet they share one global ledger known as the Ripple network.
Depending on the type and degree of interaction a user has with a
gateway, the gateway may have [Anti-money
laundering](/wiki/Anti-money_laundering "Anti-money laundering") (AML)
or [Know your customer](/wiki/Know_your_customer "Know your customer")
(KYC) policies requiring verification of identification, address,
nationality, etc.^[[2]](#cite_note-ripple-is-http-2)^ Such policies are
designed to prevent criminal activity.

[](/wiki/File:Adding_Trust_and_Allowing_Rippling.jpg "Enlarge")

Adding Trustlines and Rippling

### Trustlines[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ripple_(payment_protocol)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Trustlines")]

Users must ‘extend trust’ to the Ripple gateway that holds their
deposit. This manual creation of a trustline indicates to the Ripple
network that the user is comfortable with the gateway’s [counterparty
risk](/wiki/Counterparty_risk "Counterparty risk"). Furthermore, the
user must put a quantitative limit on this trust and create a similar
limit for each currency on deposit at that gateway. For example, if a
user deposits $50 and BTC 2.00 at The Rock Trading, the user will have
to grant trust of at least that much in both currencies to the gateway
for the monies to be available in the Ripple network. It is not
recommended for a user to grant trust to other parties unless the user
fully understands the ramifications.^[[13]](#cite_note-JohnLight-13)^

### Rippling[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ripple_(payment_protocol)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Rippling")]

When establishing a trustline, an option will present itself in the
client to allow ‘rippling’. If this option is checked and a new trust is
established in the same currency as an existing trustline, the Ripple
client will present a warning to the user. Trusting multiple gateways in
the same currency and allowing the rippling feature will subject the
user’s balance of that currency to automatically switch (or ripple)
between one gateway and another. This will not change the user’s total
balance, but will alter the issuer of the balance. This advanced tab
feature may be a source of confusion for some. Users who wish to allow
rippling can earn a small transit fee for providing inter-gateway
liquidity. It is not recommended for a user to allow rippling unless
they fully understand the ramifications.^[[14]](#cite_note-14)^

### Creditworthiness[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ripple_(payment_protocol)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Creditworthiness")]

Similar to reasons during the [Free Banking
Era](/wiki/Free_Banking_Era "Free Banking Era") in the United States,
the value of a currency can vary significantly depending on a gateway’s
creditworthiness. As of 14 May 2014, 10 gateways have met or exceeded
the standards established by the International Ripple Business
Association (IRBA), which provides unified procedures and disclosure
standards for gateways.

Market makers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ripple_(payment_protocol)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Market makers")]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any user on Ripple can act as a [market
maker](/wiki/Market_maker "Market maker") by offering an
[arbitrage](/wiki/Arbitrage "Arbitrage") service such as providing
[market liquidity](/wiki/Market_liquidity "Market liquidity"),
intra-gateway [currency
conversion](/wiki/Currency_conversion "Currency conversion"), rippling,
etc. Many such services are offered through a traditional platform of
offers to buy or sell one currency for another currency.
[Bids](/wiki/Bid_price "Bid price") and
[asks](/wiki/Ask_price "Ask price") are aggregated into [order
books](/wiki/Order_book_(trading) "Order book (trading)"), to create a
decentralized exchange. Users can transact with market makers to trade
or convert currencies.

Ripple's path finding algorithm leverages this functionality to allow
users to send money in one currency and the recipient to receive it in
another currency.^[[18]](#cite_note-SpavenOnline-18)^ For example, a
user who holds only USD balances can send a payment in EUR to a merchant
who wants to get paid in euros. This payment would get routed through
one or more market makers who were advertising a willingness to buy USD
(from the sender of the payment) and sell EUR (which gets routed to the
beneficiary of the payment).

With a sufficient number of market makers, the path finding algorithm
creates a near [frictionless
market](/wiki/Frictionless_market "Frictionless market") and enables
users to seamlessly pay each other via the network in different
currencies, without assuming any undesired foreign exchange
risk.^[[18]](#cite_note-SpavenOnline-18)^ For example, one user might
choose to hold his wealth in [bitcoins](/wiki/Bitcoin "Bitcoin"). Using
Ripple, he could seamlessly pay merchants in USD or EUR, without
exposing them to any bitcoin foreign exchange risk and without exposing
himself to USD or EUR foreign exchange risk.

XRP[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ripple_(payment_protocol)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: XRP")]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

XRP is the native currency of the Ripple network. It only exists within
the Ripple system. XRP are currently divisible to 6 decimal places. The
smallest unit is called a drop with 1 million drops equaling 1
XRP.^[[19]](#cite_note-19)^ The founders of Ripple Labs created 100
billion XRP at Ripple's inception. No more can be created according to
the rules of the Ripple protocol. Of the 100 billion created, 20 billion
XRP were retained by the creators, seeders, venture capital companies
and other founders. The remaining 80 billion were given to Ripple Labs.
Ripple Labs intends to distribute and sell 55 of that 80 billion XRP to
users and strategic partners. Ripple Labs also had a giveaway of under
200 million XRP (0.002% of all XRP) via World Community Grid that was
later discontinued.^[[20]](#cite_note-20)^ Ripple Labs will retain the
remaining 25
billion.^[[21]](#cite_note-ripple-xrp-distribution-21)^^[[22]](#cite_note-ITBusinessCA-22)^^[[23]](#cite_note-23)^^[[24]](#cite_note-Teague-24)^

As of November 30, 2012, 7.2 billion XRP have been
distributed.^[[22]](#cite_note-ITBusinessCA-22)^ The amount of XRP
distributed can be found on the Ripple website and their movement
tracked through the Ripple Live Network.^[[25]](#cite_note-25)^

XRP is the only currency in the Ripple network that does not entail
[counterparty risk](/wiki/Counterparty_risk "Counterparty risk"). It is
the only native digital asset. The other currencies in the Ripple
network are debt instruments (i.e. liabilities), and exist in the form
of balances.^[[4]](#cite_note-buterin-26-sep-2013-4)^ XRP is not
dependent on any third party for redemption. The system was designed
such that XRP is a scarce asset with decreasing supply.

Users of the Ripple network are not required to use XRP as a store of
value or a medium of exchange. Each Ripple account is required, however,
to have a small reserve of 20 XRP
^[[26]](#cite_note-proposed-reserve-26)^ (= $0.38 USD on 28 January
2014^[[27]](#cite_note-digigold-27)^). The purpose for this requirement
is discussed in the [anti-spam
section](/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)#XRP_as_an_anti-spam_measure "Ripple (payment protocol)").

### XRP as a bridge currency[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ripple_(payment_protocol)&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: XRP as a bridge currency")]

One of the specific functions of XRP is as a bridge currency. This might
be needed if no direct exchange is available between two currencies at a
specific time.^[[28]](#cite_note-28)^ Such a situation would arise when
transacting between two rarely traded currency pairs (e.g. from Qatari
Riyals to Guatemalan Quetzals). Within the network’s currency exchange,
XRP are traded freely against other currencies. Its market price
fluctuates against dollars, euros, yen, bitcoin, etc. When making
payments, many users may prefer to use XRP in lieu of these currencies.
Ripple’s design focus is as a currency exchange and a distributed
payment system, as opposed to emphasizing XRP as an [alternative
currency](/wiki/Alternative_currency "Alternative currency").

### XRP as an anti-spam measure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ripple_(payment_protocol)&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: XRP as an anti-spam measure")]

When a user conducts a financial transaction in a non-native currency,
the Ripple network charges a transaction fee. The purpose of transaction
fees is to protect against [network
flooding](/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack "Denial-of-service attack"). If
the Ripple network were completely free to access, adversaries could
broadcast large amounts of "ledger spam" (i.e. fake accounts) and
transaction spam (i.e. fake transactions) in an attempt to overload the
network. This could cause the size of the ledger to become unmanageable
and interfere with the network’s ability to quickly settle legitimate
transactions. Thus, to engage in trade, each Ripple account is required
to have a small reserve of 20
XRP,^[[26]](#cite_note-proposed-reserve-26)^ (= $0.38 USD on 28 January
2014^[[27]](#cite_note-digigold-27)^), and a transaction fee starting at
.00001 XRP ($.0000002 USD on 28 January
2014^[[27]](#cite_note-digigold-27)^) must be spent for each trade. This
transaction fee is not collected by anyone; the XRP is destroyed and
ceases to exist.^[[24]](#cite_note-Teague-24)^ The transaction fee rises
if the user posts trades at an enormous rate (many thousands per
minute), and resettles after a period of
inactivity.^[[13]](#cite_note-JohnLight-13)^ The transaction fee makes
deploying a large-scale denial-of-service attack on the network
financially expensive, while it is hoped that the effect on ordinary
users is negligible. The required reserve of 20 XRP alone will allow a
user to perform approximately 54 transactions a day for the next 100
years.

Consensus ledger[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ripple_(payment_protocol)&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Consensus ledger")]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ripple runs on a network of servers. At the heart of the network is the
ledger. It is a distributed database that is shared with all the servers
in the network. It stores information about all Ripple accounts.

A new ledger is created every few seconds. The most recent ledger is
referred to as the ‘last closed ledger’. At any time, the last closed
ledger is a perfect record of all Ripple accounts. A transaction is any
proposed change to the ledger. Any server can introduce a transaction to
the network. These transactions go out to all active Ripple servers. The
servers automatically come to consensus about a set of transactions to
apply to the ledger, creating a new ‘last closed ledger’.

The goal of consensus is for each server to apply the same set of
transactions to the current ledger. Servers continually receive
transactions from other servers on the network. These transactions form
a pool of transactions waiting to be added to the ledger. This pool is
called a candidate set. At the same time, the server receives proposals
from other servers on the network. A proposal is a set of transactions
to consider applying to the ledger. The server routes incoming proposals
based on something called the ‘unique node list’ or UNL. A UNL is simply
a list of external servers. Proposals from servers not on the UNL are
ignored. The server only pays attention to proposals from servers that
are on its UNL. The transactions in the incoming proposals are compared
against the server’s candidate set. When a transaction in an incoming
proposal matches a transaction in the candidate set, that transaction
receives one vote. The server continues to check the incoming proposals
against the candidate set until a timer expires.

At this point, the server takes the transactions that have received at
least a 50% approval rating and packages them into a new proposal. This
proposal goes out to other servers throughout the network. The process
now repeats but with an important change. The approval rating
requirement increases to 60%. Once again the server receives incoming
proposals, looks only at ones from servers on its UNL and compares these
proposals against the candidate set. Now transactions with a 60%
approval rating are packaged and sent out across the network. When the
time expires, the approval rating requirement rises to 70%. With each
iteration, the proposals will have a greater similarity to each other,
and the votes will increasingly agree.

The inevitable outcome of this process is that disputed transactions are
discarded from proposals while widely accepted transactions are
included. The dissimilarity between the proposals quickly moves toward
zero. At this point, the network has reached consensus. A server knows
that the network has consensus when 80% of the votes for every
transaction in a proposal are either ‘yes’ or ‘no’. This is the
threshold for mathematical certainty.

When a proposal hits the 80% threshold, the server validates the
proposal, alerts the network and closes its consensus process. This
validated proposal is now applied to the last closed ledger. At this
point, any invalid transaction is discarded and a new ‘last closed
ledger’ is created. Transactions that were not included in the ledger
remain in the candidate set. All transactions that were received during
the consensus process are added to the new candidate set. Then the
entire process is started again, taking only a few seconds to complete.

The Ripple network allows users or businesses to conduct cross-currency
transactions in seconds.^[[29]](#cite_note-Payment_Network-29)^ All
accounts and transactions are cryptographically secure and
algorithmically verified. Payments can only be authorized by the account
holder and all payments are processed automatically without any third
parties or intermediaries.^[[29]](#cite_note-Payment_Network-29)^ Ripple
validates accounts and balances instantly for payment transmission and
delivers payment notification with very little latency (within a few
seconds).^[[30]](#cite_note-30)^ Payments are irreversible. There are no
chargebacks.^[[31]](#cite_note-31)^ Accounts cannot be frozen, nor can
funds be seized.^[[32]](#cite_note-32)^ A ripple account does not
require pre-approval. Anyone can open an account.^[[33]](#cite_note-33)^
There are mobile apps for making payments over Ripple using a
smartphone.^[[34]](#cite_note-34)^ Ripple's Path Finding Algorithm
searches for the cheapest path between two
currencies.^[[35]](#cite_note-35)^ In the case of a user who wants to
send a payment from USD to EUR, this could be a "one-hop" path directly
from USD to EUR, or it could be a multi-hop path, perhaps from USD to
CAD to XRP to EUR. Path finding is designed to seek out the cheapest
conversion cost for the user. As of 14 May 2014, Ripple’s gateways allow
deposits in a limited number of fiat currencies (USD, EUR, MXN, NZD,
GBP, NOK, JPY, CAD, CHF, CNY, AUD), a handful of crypto currencies (BTC,
XRP, LTC, NMC, NXT, PPC, XVN, SLL) and a few commodities (gold, silver,
platinum).^[[36]](#cite_note-36)^^[[37]](#cite_note-37)^^[[38]](#cite_note-38)^

### The Bitcoin Bridge[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ripple_(payment_protocol)&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: The Bitcoin Bridge")]

The bitcoin bridge is a link between the Ripple and Bitcoin ecosystems.
The bridge makes it possible to pay any Bitcoin user straight from the
Ripple client without ever needing to hold any of the digital currency.
Additionally, any merchant accepting Bitcoins now has the potential to
accept any currency in the world. For example, a Ripple user may prefer
to keep money in USD and not own Bitcoin. A merchant, however, may
desire payment in Bitcoin. The bitcoin bridge allows any Ripple user to
send Bitcoins without having to use a central exchange such as BTC-e to
acquire them. ^[[39]](#cite_note-39)^ ^[[40]](#cite_note-40)^

Reception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ripple_(payment_protocol)&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Reception")]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Responses to Ripple have been mixed.

For its creation and development of the ripple protocol (RTXP) and the
Ripple payment/exchange network, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) recognized Ripple Labs as one of 2014’s 50 Smartest
Companies in the February 2014 edition of MIT Technology Review. The
criteria for the recognition revolved around “whether a company had made
strides in the past year that will define its field.”
^[[41]](#cite_note-41)^

The Vice President of the St. Louis Federal Reserve and professor at
Simon Fraser University, David Andolfatto, stated that "Ripple is a
currency-agnostic protocol. Ripple is the winner. It processes
anything."^[[42]](#cite_note-42)^

Writing for *Esquire* about it as a payment network, Ken Kurson said
that “the big financial-service brands ought to feel about Ripple the
way the record labels felt about Napster.”
^[[43]](#cite_note-kurson2013-43)^ On the other hand, The New York Times
website Dealbook points out that “(Ripple) is winning something that has
proved elusive for virtual currencies: involvement from more mainstream
players in the financial system.”^[[44]](#cite_note-44)^

*Bloomberg* sees that Ripple’s agreement with ZipZap puts the network in
competition with Western Union as a remittance network, noting that
while Western Union charges $40 to send $500, ZipZap will charge only
$3.95 to deposit the same amount into the Ripple
network.^[[45]](#cite_note-OlgaKharif-45)^

The reaction to XRP is polarized in the crypto-currency community.
Though the network facilitates the use of any electronic value holder,
others in the crypto-currency space are quick to point out that XRP are
“pre-mined” and that the founders retained 20% and Ripple Labs retained
25% of them while selling the majority of the remaining 55%.
^[[46]](#cite_note-46)^ This represent the largest holdback of any
crypto-currency. *Esquire* counters however that “If that is devious,
then so is every company that's ever gone public while retaining the
great bulk of its shares.” ^[[43]](#cite_note-kurson2013-43)^ Ripple
supporters feel this is especially true as Ripple Labs charges no fees
and has no revenue streams to finance its support and promotion of the
network.
