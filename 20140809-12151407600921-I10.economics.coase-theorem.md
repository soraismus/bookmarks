Graham & Coase: when big companies are a good idea
==================================================

November 26th, 2011 |
[wetware](http://yosefk.com/blog/category/wetware "View all posts in wetware")

[Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/) was once asked the following
[RAQ](http://www.paulgraham.com/raq.html) (rarely asked question):

> **How can I avoid turning into a pointy-haired boss?**

His answer:

> The pointy-haired boss is a manager who doesn't program. So the surest
> way to avoid becoming him is to stay a programmer. What tempts
> programmers to become managers are companies where the only way to
> advance is to go into management. So avoid such companies and work for
> (or start) startups.
>
> Why be a manager when you could be a founder or early employee at a
> startup?

*Why?!*Oh wow. I could fill a book explaining why. But many of my
reasons are my own, and aren't relevant to you unless you're much like
me. So I'll focus on the general answer to the question implied by Paul
Graham: **Why do large firms exist?**

The question was addressed by the economist [Ronald
Coase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase) in his article "[The
Nature of the
Firm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm)". This
article, together with his work on externalities (the [Coase
Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_Theorem)),
[earned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_Theorem) him a Nobel Prize
in economics. This is one evidence that the question is interesting and
far from trivial.

Suppose there are no good answers to Paul Graham's rhetorical question.
That is, it's always *objectively* better to start or join a small firm
than to be a manager in a large one. You'll always get more work done,
or will be more satisfied, or both. Well, if so, competition should
eventually drive large firms out of business. So why are they still
around?

For starters, clearly there are problems best solved by small groups of
people armed with off-the-shelf tools. For instance, two iconic
[YC](http://ycombinator.com/) startups funded by Paul Graham,
[Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) and
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), each solve a problem with the help
of a few programmers and a bunch of commodity servers running a
commodity software stack. A larger company could hardly improve on what
they do.

**Note that****off-the-shelf products are key to being small** (or at
least starting small). Reddit or Dropbox could never *build*those
servers from scratch. A small group of people can not erect a $5G chip
fabrication facility. Building and operating a fab – or a search engine
– requires lots of custom development, so you need a lot of people.

Or do you?

Of course the *total* number of people involved has to be very large.
But it doesn't follow that they should be organized as big companies.
Instead, the work could be done by many small organizations, each
contracting out most of the work to others.

You're big because you *hire*. Why hire if you can *buy*, contract out –
and stay small?

Indeed, this seems to make perfect sense. To quote [Wikipedia's
summary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm) of The
Nature of the Firm (1937):

> The traditional economic theory of the time suggested that, because
> the market is "efficient" (that is, those who are best at providing
> each good or service most cheaply are already doing so), it should
> always be cheaper to contract out than to hire.

Then why do most people prefer employment to self-employment, as
evidenced by their actions (and an economist never trusts anything but
actions as a tool to [reveal someone's
preferences](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_Chapter_2/PThy_CHAP_2.html "Search for revealed preference"))?
Why do I *hate* the idea of running a small firm?

Either the "traditional economic theory" is right – one should run a
small firm, and I'm a freak of nature destined to extinction due to
economic evolutionary pressure, together with much of the population –
or the theory is lacking, and there should be a concept formalizing my
aversion to self-employment.

And in fact, at this point, Coase introduces the term – **transaction
costs**:

> Coase noted, however, that there are a number of [transaction
> costs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost) to using the
> market; the cost of obtaining a good or service via the market is
> actually more than just the price of the good.

Oh, yeah – MUCH more if you ask me.

> Other costs, including search and information costs, bargaining costs,
> keeping trade secrets, and policing and enforcement costs, can all
> potentially add to the cost of procuring something via the market.

YES! Here's a Nobel Prize-winning economist from the notoriously
"pro-free market" [Chicago
school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_school_of_economics) that
UNDERSTANDS ME. He knows why I hate markets. ("Pro-market" doesn't mean
you love markets, just that you think governments are even worse.)

> This suggests that firms will arise when they can arrange to produce
> what they need internally and somehow avoid these costs.

Avoiding these costs can enable work that just can't happen outside the
context of a big company.

For instance, I work on chips for embedded computer vision, at a company
that's now fairly large. This is an example where **a lot of people need
to cooperate in a custom development effort** (as opposed to fewer
people using off-the-shelf products).

In theory, I could start a computer vision hardware startup instead of
it being an internal project. In practice, it wouldn't work, because:

-   **I wouldn't know what to build**. Hardware accelerates algorithms –
    what algorithms? I only know because I'm in the same company with
    developers of very effective unpublished algorithms. Without that
    knowledge, what could I build – an
    [OpenCV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV) accelerator? Good luck
    selling that.
-   **I couldn't build it nearly as efficiently.** A great source of
    efficiency is fitting hardware to the specific workload. But if we
    were not a part of the company but a vendor, the company would make
    sure there are competing vendors to keep prices low. This means that
    *we*, no longer having a guaranteed customer, would have to support
    *as many different workloads as possible*, to increase the pool of
    potential customers. As a rule, more generic hardware is less
    efficient.
-   **I couldn't explain how to program it.** Once you gave away your
    programming model to the customer – as you have to if you want them
    to, well, program you processors – only very strong patents can
    prevent them from cloning your hardware (possibly with the help of
    your competitor). A big company that, among other things, designs
    its own hardware doesn't have to explain it to the outside world.
    And even if its hardware ends up cloned – it's just one part of the
    secret knowledge behind the product. But if you're a small company
    only making hardware and it's cloned, you're busted. You shouldn't
    even start before making sure your ideas are "sufficiently
    patentable" – which you *don't know* before you developed those
    ideas.

Of course, the number one real reason *I* couldn't run a hardware
startup is that I'm no businessman. But the problems above are also very
real, and frequently insurmountable for people who *can*do business. Not
all custom development is impossible to successfully outsource, but much
is. The problems result from economic fundamentals.

In econ-speak, such problems are collectively known as "search and
information costs, bargaining costs, keeping trade secrets, and policing
and enforcement costs". Indeed, all these problems were featured in my
example. In plain English, a simple way to sum up all those problems is
**trust** – or more precisely, the lack thereof:

-   A company can't **trust**a vendor, so a vendor can't know its
    algorithms.
-   A company can't **trust**a vendor to keep qaulity high and prices
    low if it guarantees to remain its customer…
-   …So a vendor can't **trust**a company to remain its customer, so it
    can't invest too much in a solution just to that company's specific
    needs.
-   A vendor can't **trust** a company to keep buying from it if enough
    knowledge is given away so that the product can be cloned instead –
    so some products are not worth building.

When you work for a big company, you deal with *coworkers*, and you're
all playing for the same team. The smaller the company, the more you
deal with customers and vendors, which means playing *against* them.
There's no such word as "co-customer" or "co-vendor" for a good reason.

At least that's how things are framed by the rules. The rules say that
all employees are agents acting towards a common goal, "to promote the
company's interests" – whereas different companies have different bottom
lines and different interests.

Of course, reality is never like the rules – in reality, everyone in the
company plays by their own rules, attempting to promote the interest of
any of the following – or a combination:

-   Shareholders
-   Customers
-   Employees
-   His team
-   His manager
-   His friends
-   Himself

So in reality, of course there's a lot of chaos in a big company. And it
doesn't help that the bigger it is, the harder it is to make sense of
what's going on:

> …There is a natural limit to what can be produced internally, however.
> Coase notices "decreasing returns to the entrepreneur function",
> including increasing overhead costs and increasing propensity for an
> overwhelmed manager to make mistakes in resource allocation. This is a
> countervailing cost to the use of the firm.

…Which explains why we aren't all employed by a single all-encompassing
huge company.

But at least the rules of a large company *frame* things right – as
*cooperation*more than *competition*. (Competition generally isn't an
end – it's a means to ultimately force people to cooperate, and, as
Coase points out, it only gets you this far.)

Of course, corporate rules also create competition – employees compete
for raises, etc. But in practice, overall most would agree that it's
much safer to trust co-workers than customers or vendors.

Why be a manager when you could be a founder or early employee at a
startup? Here's the part of my answer that is based on economic
fundamentals.

I specialize in areas requiring custom development by many people. Many
people can only tightly cooperate under rules implying trust. Therefore
they must not be customers and vendors, but coworkers, which leads to
large firms. Such is The Nature of the Firm.

Of course there are problems that can be solved by a small group of
people with mutual trust, without tightly-coupled, joint development
with others – for example, the problems solved by Reddit and Dropbox.
One reason I personally never looked that way is my aversion to
business. Such is my own nature.

It just so happens that the nature of the firm suits my nature nicely –
because there are situations where big companies are a good idea. When
you can't buy and have to build, trust is fundamental to getting the job
done.

**UPDATE**(December 9, 2011): just found [an interesting
analogy](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/06/30/where-the-unix-philosophy-breaks-down/)
between company size and program size. Doing many things in one big
program can be easier than using many small programs because of
"transaction costs" – the cost of exchanging data between the programs.

  ~ I believe I understand the theory of why large corporations exist &
    of how they can be a great benefit to society as a whole, though, I
    wonder has the initial idea of the corporation become corrupted in
    it's evolution and is now a liability?

    I have noticed in my own country that many of the politicians
    "appear" to be lobbying on the side of corporations and against
    their own populations.

    After seeing my own country Prime Minister lobbying on the behalf of
    the Asbestos industry so that Canada can sell what's known as a
    deadly material to 3rd world countries and this confuses me. All my
    life this material has been extracted from homes & buildings as if
    it where an infectious disease.

    I've taken the time to review & absorb as much as my limited
    education can absorb on this subject, of big business, as I make
    every effort so sort out what is going on in the world today.

    One of the items of study that I have come across is a movie that is
    marketed as, "the most successful Canadian documentary", I would
    like to know your thoughts on this movie as it attempts to review
    the history & evolution of the corporation to it's surmised end.

    The corporation documentary can be found on YouTube at
    [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pin8fbdGV9Y&feature=related](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pin8fbdGV9Y&feature=related)
    as well as the website

    Thank you for your time and consideration, as well as, your points
    on "when big companies are a good idea".

  ~ "A company can’t trust a vendor, so a vendor can’t know its
    algorithms." Ever hear of an NDA? Similar in concept to the
    confidentiality agreements signed by employees who work for a
    company. Companies collaborate all the time on confidential
    technology.

    What keeps information supplied to employees secret? Nothing, but
    their continued good behaviour.

    The one thing that does run true from your comments above is the
    personal sentiment that you prefer working for a large firm. That's
    fine. As you suggest, not everyone can or wants to work for
    themselves, but your economic argument just sounds like
    rationalising your own personal preferences.

  ~ An NDA is fine but it still presents the problem that the vendor
    can't trust the company to continue buying, so it has to generalize,
    and be less efficient.\
     And the company can't trust the vendor to produce high quality at
    low prices, so it has to send out those NDAs to multiple vendors,
    creating a larger number of firms with their top secret but which
    (being generalized) have no particular stakes in them succeeding.

  ~ @Don: I don't think big business was ever "non-corrupted" – if you
    have lots of money, bribing the government in an attempt to make
    still more money is sort of a natural idea, especially since
    refraining from that leaves the options open to competitors. One
    possible remedy, though I'm not sure how successful it is in
    practice, is to constitutionally limit the power of what governments
    can do so that it isn't worth bribing them (for instance, AFAIK
    Switzerland can't legally print money to bail out private firms the
    way the US did – I'm not sure it's a net gain to set things up this
    way in the long run, but an interesting idea).

    @Steve, Onymous: an NDA isn't that fine, really. Wouldn't bet the
    future of a company on an NDA. There's a huge difference between
    trusting an employee, who for various widely known practical reasons
    is very unlikely to try to compete with you, and trusting a
    customer, who can very often easily become a competitor or
    collaborate with a competitor – and as to NDAs, well, good luck, and
    see you in court. If you bet on legal protection, try patents – not
    necessarily gonna work out very well, but better than NDA.

    @Steve – are you suggesting that corporations would have no chance
    in a society composed of sufficiently advanced humans or other
    economic agents that "can and want to work for themselves",
    invalidating Coase's analysis?

  ~ Well, the easy answer is that Paul Graham is stupid. Rich and
    stupid. The rich part is what makes many people not see the stupid
    part.

    (Seriously. Start reading what he writes instead of relying it like
    gospel just because he sold a startup and got rich. It's at best
    trivial but mostly just wrong. Start by reaidng about things you
    know a thing or two about yourself.)

  ~ I've recently stumbled onto what I believe may be an interesting
    concept to setup an organization that has no leaders and all are
    equal.

    This site [http://www.Bettermeans.com](http://www.Bettermeans.com)
    based on an "Open Source Concept" has some interesting ideas and
    pretty much is a contradiction to the Coase Theory as related to
    market efficiency.

    I do believe that before I venture towards setting up such a
    structure that I may want to enlist the minds of some more educated
    than I, or "social engineers", to determine if & where the concept
    may become corrupted.

    My best guess is that this structure could have issues with human
    nature such as people tend to prefer good looking folks, tall folks
    etc. & I wonder what effect that may have on such a structure.

    Still they have a very interesting idea at Better Means. I would
    welcome your thoughts on their concept of a leaderless organization
    and whether you thought the market would be more or less
    “efficient”.

    Thank you for your time & consideration.

  ~ @Don: Well, Coase didn't say anything about "leaders" – only that
    it's cheaper to produce things "internally" than obtaining them
    through the market; "internally" is a broad term, and a "firm" can
    have many structures. So I don't see a contradiction.

    That said, "self-organization" is an interesting idea or at least an
    interesting term, but part of their inspiration is Wikipedia, and I
    wouldn't like to edit Wikipedia precisely because of the sort of
    "self-organization" that's going on there, and I sure wouldn't like
    my daily work to look like editing Wikipedia. Just me, of course –
    multitudes thoroughly enjoy editing Wikipedia – just saying it's not
    for everyone.

  ~ Thank you for your valuable time and consideration.

    Yes, you do have me there and are correct that Coarse didn't say
    anything about leaders.

    I can appreciate the reference to Wikipedia and I agree that there
    are issues with how that organization is run. I have issues with the
    value of Wikipedia as a reliable reference source.

    The one thing my mamma always told me was that "it's not what you do
    that counts as much as how you do it" and that being said I do not
    agree that Wikipedia is run the same as this proposed organizational
    structure.

    I feel that many ways of doing things can be greatly improved by the
    details of how things are done & accomplished. Sometimes that one
    added line of code makes a project fly versus not.

    I'll take no more of your time & I thank you for the conversation.

    I will keep looking into this type of organizational structure and I
    will take your thoughts into consideration by looking deeper into
    Wikipedia and it's inner workings as a comparison model for this
    other "self organization" model.

    I also plan on investigating the "social engineering" aspect and
    will welcome the thoughts of others within that specific field.

  ~ Surely you mean the "Nobel memorial prize".

    For more than a hundred years, the Nobel prizes are given for
    accomplishments in five fields: Physics, Chemistry, Medicine,
    Literature, and Peace.

    There is no Nobel prize for economics. There is however the
    "Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred
    Nobel", or "Nobel Memorial Prize in economics", which was founded 40
    years ago and is not endorsed by the late Alfred Nobel.

  ~ A lot of the excitement around certain kinds of small companies is
    because they previously weren't feasible.

    Consider for example what internet sales have done for specialty
    t-shirt shops. If you have a niche product that appeals to 10,000
    people worldwide, there's hardly any place in the world where it
    makes sense to build a physical shop, but now you can sell them on
    the web. That's enabled not only by internet sales but also by low
    volume custom fabrication/manufacturing/printing companies.

    Or consider the YC style of company. Long ago they'd need to run a
    datacenter. Not that long ago they'd still need to buy and set up
    1000 machines in a rented space. Now they can get started with
    Amazon EC2 and other low cost services. Reducing the infrastructure
    up-front investment allows lots more ideas to be tried out in small
    companies, whereas before that friction meant you'd only want to try
    those ideas out in large companies.

    Open source projects and Wikipedia are also examples of things that
    were previously infeasible.

    Despite this, most products and services that were previously
    provided by large companies are still going to be provided by large
    companies, and those provided by small companies are still going to
    be provided by small companies. You just don't hear people
    \*talking\* about that because people talk about what's changing,
    not what's steady.

  ~ @Amit – my point was mainly about the trade-off between small and
    large companies, from the general economics angle as well as from a
    career choice angle; this is somewhat unrelated to these changes
    because the choice is always there (I remember alternating between a
    preference for larger companies and a preference for smaller ones
    regardless, in my case, of any shifts in the business landscape).

  ~ Interesting analysis with which I mostly agree. I think one reason
    why small companies still work well in many industries are the
    invisible ties which often make different entrepreneurs seem more
    like co-workers than as enemies.

    Say, our business interests are not exactly aligned, but I keep
    buying from you because: "we have the same investor and he tells us
    to", "we went through the same incubator program", "we used to work
    together at Google", "we play soccer in the same team on weekends",
    "our children go to the same school". I guess these ties are
    stronger in a place with high startup activity like SV, but I am
    just speculating.

    Keep up the diverse writing.

  ~ @SB: well, if it actually works the way you describe it, it's
    fascinating. I can tell, perhaps as a counter-example and perhaps
    actually as a way to support the view that departments and companies
    are not much different, that, in my experience, just becoming a part
    of different departments within the same company with the resulting
    interest misalignment can spoil cooperation between people that
    previously worked together just fine.

  ~ I think you focus too much on the functional reasons and ignore the
    obvious. Capital is advantage, whether it's money or IP or land or a
    factory or a trade secret. It's much easier to compete by creating
    an advantageous market position than to provide service to a
    customer.

    Right now your industry is new, but eventually it will become
    established. Right now most of that race is to create that advantage
    and secure a place as the big noise in a budding industry, but once
    things settle down it makes much more sense to buy out upstarts and
    minimize your risks and costs as much as possible.

    Most of the ballooning in company size is for these reasons. It's a
    lot more efficient to have a walmart than 20 five and dime stores,
    or to have a few gigantic farming concerns instead of millions of
    family farms. Of course that doesn't say the customer gets better
    sercive or products this way, generally quite the opposite.

    So right now they might pay top dollar to talented people but later
    on they will undoubtedly care much more about cutting costs even if
    it means the results are poorer, something to keep in mind as this
    takes many people by surprise. In short, get yours while you can and
    keep your eye open for the next big thing just in case – and yes,
    ultimately this means as much as us nerds hate going into business
    for ourselves or doing the work needed to build contracting
    clientele up this is always the safest way to ensure you make money.

  ~ @Bryce:

    How is one's market position advantageous if one doesn't provide
    service to customers?

    Or, "if the customer doesn't get better service or products this
    way", in what sense is Walmart "more efficient" than many small
    stores – according to what definition of "efficiency"?

    Also, why is Walmart successful while A&P is bankrupt (after a lot
    of acquisitions that were supposed to be advantageous uses of its
    capital, I guess)?

  ~ @Amit: "A lot of the excitement around certain kinds of small
    companies is because they previously weren’t feasible."

    This is perfectly in line with the theory of Transaction Cost
    Economics: higher transaction costs increase the boundaries of the
    firm (meaning we get bigger firms).

    The Internet, highway, Visa, FedEx, globalization, etc era has
    decreased transaction costs of search and communicating, clearing
    transactions, manufacturing and distribution to the point many
    activities can effectively be conducted in the market instead of
    inside the firm.

    Of course many transaction costs still exist, and Milgrom & Roberts
    style "complementarities" are a classic example of
    costly-to-outsource concerns, perhaps unknowingly spelled out
    beautifully in this article (interaction of
    hardware/software/marketing design in this case), that will never go
    away and will always ensure some place in the economy for large
    firms.

    Another commenter mentioned essentially "increasing returns to
    scale" which is just a special case of decreasing transaction costs
    with increasing scale.

    Transaction Cost Economics will often be the best way to model and
    design the boundaries of the firm; those interested should see
    Williamson's "The Economic Institutions of Capitalism" as an update
    to Coase's much earlier work. TCE is hot sh!t in economics these
    days

  ~ @RyanR: I guess I didn't think of complementary goods – rather, I
    just thought of something requiring a lot of work on custom stuff.
    Complementaries are perhaps the more interesting subset of these
    cases – "perfect complementaries" are the boring subset: one thing
    that can't be consumed/is totally useless without the other, so
    someone has to make the same amount of both, and the question is
    whether it's done by one or two firms. I guess you could say that
    perfect complementaries are rare, so that angle captures much of
    what's actually happening.

  ~ All those talks about coding standards… I just don’t get it. From my
    experience (which is not so solid at this point), coding standards
    are important on a much higher level – on the level of loose
    coupling/high cohesion, design patterns, etc. Vars and class and
    method names – this is from another opera.

    All homes in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv are designed with loose
    coupling/high cohesion in mind, they are separate and have
    well-defined simple interfaces (doors, windows, address (which is
    not a completely unique id but still..)). Anyone from another
    country can use those simple interfaces very well. So why bother
    with roofs color?..

    If you arrive in a city and you see that (its written in perl
    hahaha) it has actually one big house instead of separate houses,
    and you cant get inside, cause it does not implement
    EnterenceAndWindows interface, or the door is 7 kilometers above the
    sea level… Would you be much concerned about the fact that this
    houses walls are painted with green?

    Coding standards can somehow help you program faster, or to keep in
    mind more things relevant to your project or manipulate them with
    more ease? I don’t think so.

    I think its more like the real world – first you know what you are
    going to do, then you’ll get the details on how you will do that
    (intention first). For example you want to get drunk with Dave – you
    surf the documentation on how to, then youll use IDE with
    autocomlition to quickly make it happen. Would it be\
     Humans.CurrentLocation.Dave.Deeds.getReallyDrunk(Me, Today, true);\
     or it would be more like\
     humans.current\_location.dave.deeds.get\_really\_drunk(me, today,
    true);\
     or even\
     thingsToDoNow.getDrunk(Dave, extremely, yes\_i\_mean\_extremely);

    Who cares? I surf documentation, use autocomplition and not storing
    in my mind method names (even if i did, it would be too easy to mix
    things up independently of using coding standards (is it
    getDrunk(Dave) or Dave.getDrunk(true) ? I don’t have to know!))

  ~ Becoming a big firm doesn't necessarily decrease transaction costs.
    Take Microsoft, for example. They are a huge firm, and have to
    interact with many customers (HP, Dell, Toshiba, etc). The only
    reason they don't vertically integrate (like Apple did), is because
    they have the deep pockets to cover these transaction costs. They
    also have enough money to sue their customers, when trust is
    violated.

    I find that the big firms you are referring to (i.e. Vertically
    Integrated firms), do save on transaction costs, but \_more
    importantly\_ they get to avoid the hold-up problem. Which,
    fundamentally, is the inability to objectively trust a
    company/vendor, unless the interests are aligned.

    It seems that vertical integration is ideal if there is only one
    supplier of $RESOURCE. Even if there are multiple suppliers, they
    could still conspire to simultaneously raise prices. (Kind of like
    what OPEC did in the 70's).

    Thus, vertical integration can be thought of as minimizing
    dependence on foreign elements.

    Here's another software analogy:

    Open Source is a form of vertical integration, that minimized
    dependence on distributors of binary software. Even if the binary
    software is good, the vendors, holding a monopoly on the source
    code, hold a monopoly on improvements and enhancements. It is very
    easy for a binary software vendor to discontinue improvements and
    support for code that a dependent party may use for core
    functionality, thus putting a major speed-bump in the dependent
    party's growth path.

    Open source solves this problem, by commoditizing things like OS's
    and compilers, and preventing any vendor from monopolizing
    improvements/enhancements. By using certain open source components,
    companies can vertically integrate fixes to these systems into their
    corporate structure (like Google with Linux, Joyent with Illumos,
    Apple with FreeBSD and Darwin [and Microsoft with Windows, because
    they have access to the code]).

    So, to summarize, I wouldn't say that "big firms" are solutions to
    the trust problem, as much as "vertically integrated firms" are.
    It's just that such firms \_tend\_ to be big but they probably don't
    have to be. Oh, and open source \_is a form of\_ vertical
    integration.

  ~ I think you give a little too much value to the effects of patents
    and trade secrets–it is my understanding that ideas need to flow to
    people who are interested in them, for them to thrive–but even so, I
    think the rest of your blogpost is probably spot on.

    Ideas are harder to implement than many patent proponents make it
    out to be. If your company were to publish all your algorithms, and
    even the information for creating your chips, would just anyone be
    able to take that information, and suddenly become a competitor with
    you? No, they cannot. Your competitors \*might\* be able to absorb
    that information, but they also have their own goals and ambitions,
    and trying to use that information might be as much a hinderance to
    those ambitions, as it would be a help.

    Having said that, for a couple of decades, at least, I've been
    wanting a little device, the size of a laser printer, that would
    allow me to build, if not any silicon device I wanted, at least
    simple ones that I can experiment with. Op amps and small processors
    and so forth. Even though I was in Junior High at the time I started
    having this desire, even then I knew how much of a pipe dream it
    was: how the heck am I going to dampen the vibrations of the Earth,
    which are known to adversely affect chip manufacturing? How am I
    going to keep that device stocked up with highly caustic chemicals?

    As much as I'm attracted to small businesses, I am like you: I have
    no interest in \*being\* a business person–I just want to experiment
    with ideas, and to try to develop new ones. Thus, it probably isn't
    a good idea for me to found a startup; the best that I can hope for
    is to join one early on.

    A previous commenter said Graham is "rich and stupid". I don't think
    that's the case at all. Graham is someone who desires freedom, and
    sees oppression in large organisations–and he is correct, as far as
    that goes–but there are a lot of people who don't mind giving up a
    certain degree of freedom, to be a part of something that is likely
    impossible to do on a tiny scale! Thus, Graham's words are best
    applicable to those who desire freedom.

    On the other hand, I've often wondered if something like Microsoft
    can be duplicated by dozens of small companies, each paying each
    other for their services…

    I apologize for my somewhat rambling comment. It could probably be
    best summarized as "You're right, and Paul's right, all because the
    Market is 'flexible enough' to accommodate the best solution for a
    given problem, whether the solution be small or big!'".

  ~ Come to think of it, my last sentence reminded me of an essay I read
    a few months ago, called "I, Pencil". You mentioned that Reddit and
    Dropbox benefit from thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of
    people, all doing things to support their work. In this essay, the
    author is writing from the point of view of a standard \#2 yellow
    pencil with a pink rubber eraser at the end; making that one pencil,
    and bringing it to market, may very well be as complex as putting
    together a microchip, or supporting a service like Dropbox.

    Whether the solution is found in bringing together a lot of small
    solutions (as in Dropbox) or integrating a lot of people together in
    a large solution (as in your company), the order in the complexity,
    even chaos, is amazing to behold!

  ~ Regarding patents (not that I particularly like the idea of patents,
    mind you): I can tell you with certainty that it is patents that
    sustain the businesses of IP companies like ARM and MIPS (otherwise
    people could legally clone them without paying for an "architecture
    license"). In fact, CPU instruction sets are pretty much guaranteed
    to accumulate (barely needed) new fancy instructions so that when
    older patents expire, new patents can prevent legal cloning of newer
    CPUs.
