I Can’t Afford a Bachelor’s Degree, So I’m Making My Own
--------------------------------------------------------

**Options for degrees are terrible**

I fundamentally disagree with the popular belief that colleges and
universities should essentially be nothing more than job training
centers. Which is why I’m saying upfront, if my goal was solely to get a
job that requires a bachelor’s degree when I graduate, then yes, it
makes sense to attend one of the schools I can find a way to eventually
pay for regardless of the school’s academic quality.

But that’s not my only goal. In my mind higher education should be
almost exclusively about academics. I’m looking for an affordable degree
program that is academically rigorous, and provides me the opportunity
to challenge myself and not be restricted to the 10 or 12 classes
available in a major. The two small public schools in commuting distance
to me don’t provide the academic quality I expect in a program that
costs $12,000/year in tuition, fees, and books (plus commuting costs).
While the large public school in commuting distance, costs over
$17,000/year (again not including commuting costs).

The higher education market hasn’t provided a student like myself access
to a program that is both affordable and rigorous. In addition to the
prohibitive cost of a degree, I can’t justify attending a school where
adjunct professors aren’t getting paid a reasonable amount of money.
It’s flat out wrong to be charged tuition for amenities and
administrators that I don’t and/or can’t use, and provide no value to
me, while the professors providing the value I’m paying for aren’t
seeing much of my money.

**A quality (assured) education**

As the ability to learn in different environments becomes more
accessible (e.g. taking an online course taught via live
web-conferencing from a professor in a different country). The only
thing missing is the quality assurance that comes with the accreditation
of a bachelor’s degree from an already established institution. (even
though some terrible schools and programs are accredited by the
respected accrediting agencies… but that’s a different conversation.)

So, when I pay tuition and “fees”, I’m actually paying for the seal of
approval that comes with that school’s accreditation, because there’s no
other accredited game in town.

**How This Is Going To Work**

My situation isn’t unique. While I would love to start a university for
students like myself, the accreditation system makes that nearly
impossible. But I *CAN* start a new accrediting agency. So that’s what
I’ve done. [Alyxandria](http://www.alyxandria.org) is a non-profit
accrediting agency that provides peer reviewed accreditation for courses
and degrees, and requires students to pay professors directly at a
reasonable price set by the professor.

Alyxandria follows a simple model. Basically, a panel of experts in a
field acting like a dissertation committee or an academic journal’s
review committee, determine four things:

-   Whether or not learning outcomes, and the courses and competency
    exams that certify the fulfillment of those outcomes are of rigorous
    academic quality.

-   That the requirements in the degree framework [1] are being met. The
    requirements are taken from the Quality Assurance Agency degree
    framework for a bachelor’s degree with honours in the United Kingdom
    [2]. The spirit of the requirements match requirements for similar
    degrees in most countries that utilize a degree framework.

-   That both comprehensive examinations and an undergraduate thesis
    have been passed. Prior to graduation, students must pass
    comprehensive examinations, and more importantly, submit an
    undergraduate thesis that allows a student to demonstrate they fully
    understand their field of study and are prepared for graduate level
    work.

**All that being said…**

It’s easy to criticize a degree, especially something new, for not being
of a high enough quality. I’m the first person to read a title like the
one to this post and be critical. I’d just like to note that given these
requirements, specifically the comprehensive examinations and
undergraduate thesis, most students who earn bachelor’s degrees at
schools around the US, regardless of the school, wouldn’t qualify for an
Alyxandria accredited bachelor’s degree.

No matter what happens I think this is a cool experiment, and will
probably result in a good (and potentially embarrassing) story to tell
one day. The potential for a good story, is one of my only requirements
in deciding to do or not do something.
