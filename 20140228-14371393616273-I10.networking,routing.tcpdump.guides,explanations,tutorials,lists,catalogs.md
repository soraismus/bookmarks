[ Check out my latest post on the HP Security Blog: [“The Secure Web
Series, Part 2: How to Avoid User Account
Harvesting”](http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Fortify-Application-Security/The-Secure-Web-Series-Part-2-How-to-Avoid-User-Account/ba-p/6386883)
]

[`tcpdump`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcpdump) is the premier network
analysis tool for [information
security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security)
professionals. Having a solid grasp of this über-powerful application is
mandatory for anyone desiring a thorough understanding of
[TCP/IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCPIP). Many prefer to use higher
level analysis tools such as [~~Ethereal~~](http://www.ethereal.com/)
[Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/), but I believe this to usually be
a mistake.

In a discipline so dependent on a true understanding of concepts vs.
[rote learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_learning), it's
important to stay fluent in the underlying mechanics of the TCP/IP
suite. A thorough grasp of these protocols allows one to troubleshoot at
a level far beyond the average analyst, but mastery of the protocols is
only possible through continued exposure to them.

When using a tool that displays network traffic a more natural (raw) way
the burden of analysis is placed directly on the human rather than the
application. This approach cultivates continued and elevated
understanding of the TCP/IP suite, and for this reason I *strongly*
advocate using `tcpdump` instead of other tools whenever possible.

Options
-------

Below are a few options (with examples) that will help you greatly when
working with the tool. They're easy to forget and/or confuse with other
types of filters, i.e. ethereal, so hopefully this page can serve as a
reference for you, as it does me.

First off, I like to add a few options to the `tcpdump` command itself,
depending on what I'm looking at. The first of these is **-n**, which
requests that names are not resolved, resulting in the IPs themselves
always being displayed. The second is **-X**, which displays both hex
and ascii content within the packet. The final one is **-S**, which
changes the display of sequence numbers to absolute rather than
relative. The idea there is that you can't see weirdness in the sequence
numbers if they're being hidden from you. Remember, the advantage of
using `tcpdump` vs. another tool is getting manual interaction with the
packets.

It's also important to note that `tcpdump` only takes the first ~~68~~
96 bytes of data from a packet by default. If you would like to look at
more, add the **-s *number*** option to the mix, where *number* is the
number of bytes you want to capture. I recommend using 0 (zero) for a
snaplength, which gets everything. Here's a short list of the options I
use most:

-   **`-i any`** : Listen on all interfaces just to see if you're seeing
    any traffic.
-   **`-n`** : Don't resolve hostnames.
-   **`-nn`** : Don't resolve hostnames *or* port names.
-   **`-X`** : Show the packet's *contents* in both
    [hex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexidecimal) and
    [ASCII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii).
-   **`-XX`** : Same as **`-X`**, but also shows the ethernet header.
-   **`-v, -vv, -vvv`** : Increase the amount of packet information you
    get back.
-   **`-c`** : Only get *x* number of packets and then stop.
-   **`-s`** : Define the *snaplength* (size) of the capture in bytes.
    Use `-s0` to get everything, unless you are intentionally capturing
    less.
-   **`-S`** : Print absolute sequence numbers.
-   **`-e`** : Get the ethernet header as well.
-   **`-q`** : Show less protocol information.
-   **`-E`** : Decrypt IPSEC traffic by providing an encryption key.

[ The default snaplength as of `tcpdump` 4.0 has changed from 68 bytes
to 96 bytes. While this will give you more of a packet to see, it still
won't get everything. Use `-s 1514` to get full coverage ]

Basic Usage
-----------

So, based on the kind of traffic I'm looking for, I use a different
combination of options to `tcpdump`, as can be seen below:

1.  **Basic communication** // see the basics without many options

    \# tcpdump -nS

2.  **Basic communication (very verbose)** // see a good amount of
    traffic, with verbosity and no name help

    \# tcpdump -nnvvS

3.  **A deeper look at the traffic** // adds -X for payload but doesn't
    grab any more of the packet

    \# tcpdump -nnvvXS

4.  **Heavy packet viewing** // the final "s" increases the snaplength,
    grabbing the whole packet

    \# tcpdump -nnvvXSs 1514

Here's a capture of exactly two (`-c2`)
[ICMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icmp) packets (a
[ping](http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/icmp/msg8.htm) and
[pong](http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/icmp/msg0.htm)) using
some of the options described above. Notice how much we see about each
packet.

Common Syntax
-------------

Expressions allow you to trim out various types of traffic and find
exactly what you're looking for. Mastering the expressions and learning
to combine them creatively is what makes one truly powerful with
`tcpdump`. There are three main types of expression: `type`, `dir`, and
`proto`.

Type options are `host`, `net`, and `port`. Direction is indicated by
`dir`, and there you can have `src`, `dst`, `src or dst`, and
`src and dst`. Here are a few that you should definitely be comfortable
with:

-   **`host`** // look for traffic based on IP address (also works with
    hostname if you're not using **-n**) \

    \# tcpdump host 1.2.3.4

-   **`src`**, **`dst`** // find traffic from only a source or
    destination (eliminates one side of a **host** conversation) \

    \# tcpdump src 2.3.4.5 \
     \# tcpdump dst 3.4.5.6

-   **`net`** // capture an entire network using
    [CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)
    notation \

    \# tcpdump net 1.2.3.0/24

-   **`proto`** // works for tcp, udp, and icmp. Note that you don't
    have to type `proto` \

    \# tcpdump icmp

-   **`port`** // see only traffic to or from a certain port \
    \# tcpdump port 3389
-   **`src, dst port`** // filter based on the source or destination
    port \

    \# tcpdump src port 1025 \
     \# tcpdump dst port 389

-   **`src/dst, port, protocol`** // combine all three \

    \# tcpdump src port 1025 and tcp \
     \# tcpdump udp and src port 53

You also have the option to filter by a *range* of ports instead of
declaring them individually, and to only see packets that are above or
below a certain size.

-   **Port Ranges** // see traffic to any port in a range \
     `tcpdump portrange 21-23`
-   **Packet Size Filter** // only see packets below or above a certain
    size (in bytes) \
     `tcpdump less 32` \
     `tcpdump greater 128`

Writing to a File
-----------------

`tcpdump` allows you to send what you're capturing to a file for later
use using the **`-w`** option, and then to read it back using the
**`-r`** option. This is an excellent way to capture raw traffic and
then run it through various tools later.

The traffic captured in this way is stored in `tcpdump` format, which is
pretty much universal in the network analysis space. This means it can
be read in by all sorts of tools, including
[Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/ "Wireshark · Go deep."),
[Snort](http://www.snort.org/ "Snort :: Home Page"), etc.

#### Capture all Port 80 Traffic to a File

\# tcpdump -s 1514 port 80 -w capture\_file

Then, at some point in the future, you can then read the traffic back in
like so:

#### Read Captured Traffic back into `tcpdump`

\# tcpdump -r capture\_file

Getting Creative
----------------

Expressions are nice, but the real magic of `tcpdump` comes from the
ability to *combine* them in creative ways in order to isolate exactly
what you're looking for. There are three ways to do combinations, and if
you've studied computers at all they'll be pretty familar to you:

1.  **AND** \
     *`and`* or `&&`
2.  **OR** \
     *`or`* or `||`
3.  **EXCEPT** \
     *`not`* or `!`

### More Examples

\# TCP traffic from 10.5.2.3 destined for port 3389

tcpdump -nnvvS and src 10.5.2.3 and dst port 3389

\# Traffic originating from the 192.168 network headed for the 10 or
172.16 networks

tcpdump -nvX src net 192.168.0.0/16 and dst net 10.0.0.0/8 or
172.16.0.0/16

\# Non-ICMP traffic destined for 192.168.0.2 from the 172.16 network

tcpdump -nvvXSs 1514 dst 192.168.0.2 and src net and not icmp

\# Traffic originating from Mars or Pluto that isn't to the SSH port

tcpdump -vv src mars and not dst port 22

As you can see, you can build queries to find just about anything you
need. The key is to first figure out *precisely* what you're looking for
and then to build the syntax to isolate that specific type of traffic.

### Grouping

Also keep in mind that when you're building complex queries you might
have to group your options using single quotes. Single quotes are used
in order to tell `tcpdump` to ignore certain special characters -- in
this case the "( )" brackets. This same technique can be used to group
using other expressions such as `host`, `port`, `net`, etc. Take a look
at the command below:

\# Traffic that's from 10.0.2.4 AND destined for ports 3389 or 22
**(incorrect)**

tcpdump src 10.0.2.4 and (dst port 3389 or 22)

If you tried to run this otherwise very useful command, you'd get an
error because of the parenthesis. You can either fix this by escaping
the parenthesis (putting a \\ before each one), or by putting the entire
command within single quotes:

\# Traffic that's from 10.0.2.4 AND destined for ports 3389 or 22
**(correct)**

tcpdump 'src 10.0.2.4 and (dst port 3389 or 22)'

Advanced
--------

You can also filter based on specific portions of a packet, as well as
combine multiple conditions into groups. The former is useful when
looking for only SYNs or RSTs, for example, and the latter for even more
advanced traffic isolation.

[ Hint: An anagram for the TCP flags: [**U**nskilled **A**ttackers
**P**ester **R**eal **S**ecurity
**F**olk](http://danielmiessler.com/study/tcpflags/) ]

Show me all URGENT **(URG)** packets...

\# tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 32!=0'

Show me all ACKNOWLEDGE **(ACK)** packets...

\# tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 16!=0'

Show me all PUSH **(PSH)** packets...

\# tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 8!=0'

Show me all RESET **(RST)** packets...

\# tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 4!=0'

Show me all SYNCHRONIZE **(SYN)** packets...

\# tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 2!=0'

Show me all FINISH **(FIN)** packets...

\# tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 1!=0'

Show me all SYNCHRONIZE/ACKNOWLEDGE **(SYNACK)** packets...

\# tcpdump 'tcp[13]=18'

[ Note: Only the PSH, RST, SYN, and FIN flags are displayed in
`tcpdump`'s flag field output. URGs and ACKs are displayed, but they are
shown elsewhere in the output rather than in the flags field ]

Keep in mind the reasons these filters work. The filters above find
these various packets because `tcp[13]` looks at offset 13 in the [TCP
header](http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/tcp.htm), the number
represents the location within the byte, and the !=0 means that the flag
in question is set to 1, i.e. it's on.

As with most powerful tools, however, there are multiple ways to do
things. The example below shows another way to capture packets with
specific TCP flags set.

Capture TCP Flags Using the `tcpflags` Option...

\# tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags] & & tcp-syn != 0'

### Specialized Traffic

Finally, there are a few quick recipes you'll want to remember for
catching specific and specialized traffic, such as IPv6 and
malformed/likely-malicious packets.

IPv6 traffic

\# tcpdump ip6

Packets with both the RST and SYN flags set (why?)

\# tcpdump 'tcp[13] = 6'

Traffic with the 'Evil Bit' Set

\# tcpdump 'ip[6] & 128 != 0'

Conclusion
----------

Well, this primer should get you going strong, but [the man
page](http://www.tcpdump.org/tcpdump_man.html) should always be handy
for the most advanced and one-off usage scenarios. I truly hope this has
been useful to you, and feel free to [contact
me](http://danielmiessler.com/contact/) if you have any questions. ::
