[Biography](http://topics.wsj.com/person/A/biography/8046)

Updated Sept. 5, 2014 7:29 p.m. ET

Analysts for the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security
Agency and more than a dozen other government organizations depend on
their ability to forecast national and global events to help ward off
various threats to the country, but old-style approaches can produce
flawed results.

To improve quality, the government has taken the unusual step of running
tournaments that invite people outside the intelligence community to
develop better ways to forecast world events, and several have produced
notable results.

"Traditional forecasting in the intelligence community relied on human
judgment, and the way in which humans make those judgments has tended to
be unstructured deliberation," said Jason G. Matheny, a project manager
for [IARPA](http://www.iarpa.gov/), the Intelligence Advanced Research
Projects Activity, which is the research and development arm of the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Deliberation is useful, but it isn't ideal for generating accurate
forecasts: It is susceptible to groupthink. Social biases, such as
deferring to those with seniority, intrude on the process. And
dissenting views often aren't captured. The effects have led analysts to
predict events that didn't occur, or miss events that did take place.
"Pearl Harbor would be a failure to warn," Mr. Matheny said.

Other examples that took the U.S. by surprise, he said, include the Suez
crisis of the 1950s, the fall of the Shah of Iran in the 1970s and, more
recently, the al Qaeda attacks of Sept, 11, 2001.

Among the forecasting tournaments run by IARPA are Aggregative
Contingent Estimation (ACE), Forecasting Science and Technology (ForeST)
and Open Source Indicators (OSI).

Each seeks to improve the precision and timeliness of intelligence
forecasts by using techniques such as crowdsourcing, probability scores
and machine learning—a field of computer science that "teaches"
computers to recognize patterns in data. The strategies offset the
weaknesses of any single source and overcome human tendencies to over-
or underestimate the possibility of an event.

ACE launched first, in 2011, with five teams competing, but the [Good
Judgment Project,](http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/) led by Philip
Tetlock of the University of Pennsylvania, beat out its rivals and now
is the only team that IARPA funds.

The project uses thousands of amateur forecasters to answer hundreds of
specific questions regarding world affairs. The competitors' goal was to
beat a control group by 50% according to Brier scores, a measure of the
accuracy of probabilistic predictions, by the third year of the
four-year competition. "This team beat that metric by 70%, and they did
it in year two," said Steven D. Rieber, who manages the project for
IARPA.

IARPA attributes the success to several factors: Forecasters receive a
90-minute training module on cognitive biases and probability. The best
are drafted onto elite teams. And all forecasts for a particular
question are combined into a single probability attached to each
possible outcome, with more weight given to better forecasters.

ForeST, led by George Mason University's
[SciCast](https://scicast.org/#!/) team, broke off from ACE in 2013 to
focus specifically on developments in science and technology, and uses
similar techniques. Tracking developments in these fields may help
identify advances in weapons systems or emerging technologies in
bioterrorism or cyberthreats.

"SciCast lets us measure the quality of our predictions and improve
them," said Charles Twardy, who leads the project.

Among SciCast's predictions this year was that between 10 and 12 states
would report cases of West Nile virus by Aug. 1. Eleven did. And an open
question seeks to predict when China will complete its first moonwalk.

While ACE and ForeST address specific questions, OSI, which launched in
2012, identifies previously undetected activity that will culminate in
an event of interest—such as a violent protest—within days or weeks.

Among the events the team has detected are the student protests in
Venezuela earlier this year and the 2013 hantavirus outbreak in Chile
and Argentina.

[EMBERS](http://dac.cs.vt.edu/projects/embers), the winning OSI project,
beat out two competitors and is led by Naren Ramakrishnan at Virginia
Tech. To identify brewing events, the team vacuums up large volumes of
publicly available data, including online news, blogs, social media such
as Twitter posts, Wikipedia pages, weather data, crime rates and images
of, for example, parking lots outside hospitals—to name a few of the
myriad sources.

The group looks for classes of events, such as political unrest or
disease outbreaks. However, instead of attempting to build a single
computer model to accommodate all types of forecasts, the team created
many separate models with different strengths and weaknesses. Each event
class has about eight models, and the conclusions produced by each are
weighted and combined to produce a single forecast.

"You can think of it as a little marketplace of algorithms all competing
with each other, trying to outdo other predictions," Mr. Ramakrishnan
said.

To help gauge the success of OSI, IARPA catalogues world events as they
happen and compares the list to events previously forecast by OSI. On
average, the program has detected 90% of all eventual events of
interest.

None of these techniques will replace standard intelligence approaches,
but they are likely to provide analysts with additional tools that treat
forecasting as a skill, with results that can be measured and, as a
result, refined and improved.
