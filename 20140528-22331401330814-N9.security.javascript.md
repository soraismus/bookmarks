I have recently started using [NoScript](http://noscript.net/) (in
addition to ABP). It took a little while to get used to it and can
occasionally require some clicking when visiting a new site to
investigate why the site's not working and where I need to allow
JavaScript from. Is the extra security worth it?

Some of the controversy [is discussed
here](http://superuser.com/questions/587/must-have-firefox-addons/1014#1014).
I suppose it boils down to a matter of whether JavaScript is a genuine
threat to your computer or not. Any thoughts on this?

The reason NoScript even exists in the first place is not necessarily
JavaScript *per se*, but security holes in the browser. In the past
Firefox and other browsers have had many security vulnerabilities that
have allowed malicious JavaScript to do bad things to a user's system.
(In many cases native code could be run through JavaScript, meaning a
website could potentially do anything to your computer.) There is also a
possibility of [cross-site
scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attacks,
like @Eric said.

However, in my experience, these threats are not really threats at all.
If you stay up-to-date and don't visit questionable websites on a
regular basis, you'll be fine. NoScript is, in my opinion, more of a
pain than anything else. **I don't think it's worth temporarily shutting
out 99.9% of the websites you visit just to protect yourself from the
other 0.1%.** If you're really that worried, re-evaluate your browsing
habits.

* * * * *

That said, if you're worried about going to potentially malicious
websites, you could install [Web of Trust](http://www.mywot.com/): it's
a Firefox add-on that shows a "WOT rating" next to links on popular
websites such as Google, and prevents you from going to websites with a
low rating. That way, you can tell if a website is malicious before even
clicking on it. With this method, you aren't hampering your browsing
experience in any way, and you get practically the same security
benefit.

See
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site\_scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting)
and
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site\_request\_forgery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)
for examples of how someone with malicious intent can cause problems
using JavaScript.

FWIW - I personally don't roll with NoScript as I think it's a major
headache. Sometimes you just have to watch where you're browsing and
hope for the best.

I dunno, I think both of those are bigger concerns for the web developer
than for the user. I suppose a poorly designed site is susceptible to
those kinds of flaws which then in turn could compromise the user's
data.. but really, what kind of stuff are they going to steal? You
username on some crummy forum? Whoopy doo. Only place it matters is when
you've got credit card info and stuff, but you should *never* be
entering that sort of info on a site you don't trust in the first place.

@Mark, Do you understand what CSRF is? Say you have your browser open to
your bank and another tab open to an evil site. With a CSRF the evil
site can trick your browser into making a request to your bank to
transfer all your money out of your account. –

You can protect yourself from CSRF by logging out of sensitive sites
before going elsewhere. Though I'd like to think banks would be designed
without this glaring hole, I know they haven't been in the past. –

-   Poorly written or malicious JavaScript can crash your browser, or
    cause it to freeze up
-   JavaScript may be used to cause drive-by downloads

-   But, used properly and as intended, JavaScript does enhance the web
    browsing experience

There are pros and cons, but on the whole it is worth the trouble. For
the record, I always use the NoScript extension, selectively enabling
scripts for the sites I regularly visit and I expect are safe.

No, I don't think it's a genuine threat at all. It was designed
deliberately with limited privileges so that no one can wreck havoc on
your computer. There might be the occasional security exploit that will
crop up from time to time, but any browser worth its salt will eliminate
this threat in no time at all (hence why you should keep your browser up
to date). That said, I think JavaScript is fairly mature now and I don't
think we'll be seeing any ground-breaking flaws any time soon. As Eric
pointed out, people could use JavaScript to steal your Cookies or
something, but that's only if the *site* is vulnerable to those kinds of
attacks (they allow someone else to include JavaScript on *their*
pages). Again, there's rarely anything valuable in a Cookie (in fact,
there never *should* be or the site is storing information that they
shouldn't!). If that's the case, the website you're viewing is the
problem, not JavaScript, and they're probably leaking your precious
information in other ways too. Stop worrying about JS, and just be smart
about what you post on the internet.

* * * * *

In response to Josh K's link (which you should not click), JavaScript
can be very *annoying*, but generally not harmful. I guess it depends on
the sort of user you are. "Power users" generally know what they
shouldn't click.

@Zoredache: It's simple. There's 24 million internet users in Canada
alone, in order to meet the "millions" quota I only need \> 1 mil. I
think, or would hope, it's safe to say there are at least 2 million
competent interneteers out there. Jokes aside, fine, I retract my
statement. *I* personally, and many of my friends, have never had any
problems leaving JS enabled. But I guess that's because I'm
computer-savvy then. If you don't know what you're doing, and you're
prone to malware, then fine, disable it. –

I consider myself "computer savy" but browse with noscript as it removes
so much crap from pages. (Even with adblock). Plus how on earth are
"power users" supposed to be able to tell what tinyurls are safe,
exactly? Or any url for that matter. And yes, XSS is the website's
fault, but if I can stop (some) instances of this on my end, why would I
chose not to do so? –

Look at who posted the tinyurl? Was it one of your friends, or was it
some troll? It's not perfect.... but... anywho, to each his own. –

While there have technically been exploits in image processing and XML
rendering and the like, for all intents and purposes there are presently
three vectors of attack: social engineering (tricking the user, getting
the user to run a malicious file), plugins (Flash), and JavaScript.

JavaScript directly allows instructions to be run, and it's particularly
bad in the case of Internet Explorer due to the incredibly poor decision
and implementation of ActiveX controls in the past (though Microsoft has
improved in this regard). You also don't have to necessarily go to shady
sites, as ads are served in JavaScript and there are multiple cases of
where malicious ads have been served to legitimate sites.

Short answer: If you're going to worry about threats, there are three
things to be concerned about: Internet Explorer, Flash, and JavaScript.

"JavaScript directly allows instructions to be run" -- source? This is
true in older version of IE due to ActiveX, but nowdays that only
happens when security exploits are found, and those are usually patched
pretty quickly. JavaScript itself actually can't do very much to your
system--at most, it could slow down or maybe crash your browser. –

JavaScript is a programming language, you write instructions. I'm not
referring to machine code level instructions, I'm referring to the
language itself -- that running JavaScript is running code; no more no
less. Contrastable to HTML and CSS (aside from eval in IE) which are
purely descriptive. Because of that, the likelihood of vulnerabilities
through JavaScript is astronomically higher -- JavaScript is only benign
if there are no mistakes either in implementation or specifications,
which will never happen. –
