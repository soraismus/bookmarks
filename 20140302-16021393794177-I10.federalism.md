How the States Committed Suicide
--------------------------------

**By** [**Paul Moreno**](/authors/paul_moreno/)\

In Obamacare, Congress made the states an offer it thought they couldn't
refuse: If they expanded their Medicaid systems to include residents
with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty rate, Washington would
pick up 100 percent of the tab for the first three years. And any state
that didn't go along would see its federal Medicaid dollars eliminated
entirely.

When the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in 2012, it held
that Congress could not punish states so severely for failing to enact
federal legislators' preferred policies. (Medicaid composes the largest
part of most state budgets, and the federal government automatically
picks up 50 to 83 percent of each state's Medicaid spending, no matter
how much they choose to spend.) Nevertheless, about half of the states
have gone along. This can be seen as the last step toward making the
states nothing more than administrative units of the federal government,
completing a process that began a century ago.

How did the once-sovereign states become wards of Washington? They did
it to themselves. State politicians came to recognize that they would
benefit from a more powerful national government. As scholars like
Michael Greve and Todd Zywicki have shown, state actors helped to break
down the original constitutional system of "competitive federalism,"
which kept government limited as states competed with each other to
attract business and labor. In its place they contrived a parasitical
"cooperative" or "cartel" federalism, in which states extract wealth
from each other through the federal government.

The first and most important steps came in 1913, when the states
ratified the Sixteenth and the Seventeenth Amendments. The Seventeenth
was the greatest structural change ever made to the Constitution. State
legislatures gave up their power to choose U.S. senators. The Senate no
longer represented the states as states, and senators became agents of
federal empowerment. Historically, the Senate had been the more
conservative chamber of Congress (as the Founders intended); after 1913
it became the more liberal.

The Sixteenth Amendment gave Congress the power to tax incomes. Federal
tax revenue had never been more than 10 percent of GDP. Soon after they
were never less than 10 percent, and after World War II they were never
less than 20 percent. The states had handed over a tremendous revenue
source to the federal government.

And what did Congress do with all the revenue? It gave a lot of it back
to the states. Congress was able to do things that the Constitution did
not allow it to do by paying the states to do them -- provided the state
programs met congressional standards. The first such "grant-in-aid" was
for the prevention of forest fires in 1911. With help from the income
tax, the concept was extended to maternity and child care, education,
road-building, and other matters. When Massachusetts challenged the
constitutionality of these grants, the Supreme Court dismissed the suit
for lack of jurisdiction.

This decision, *Massachusetts v. Mellon* (1923), was particularly
important, because the courts had been important enforcers of
"competitive federalism." The Supreme Court added to *Massachusetts* in
1938, when it permitted state law to prevail over federal common law in
areas like torts and contracts. States now competed to be the most
friendly forum in which plaintiffs could sue out-of-state corporations.

Grants-in-aid helped to hide the real increase in federal power after
World War II. Federal civilian employment has hardly increased at all,
despite a doubling of the population. (The increased use of contractors
also helps hide the growth of government.) Washington now provides
one-third of all state revenue, an all-time high, even though state and
local taxes rose from 6 percent of GDP in 1953 to 14 percent in 2007.

State governments have also ceded sovereignty to public-employee unions;
many of them adopted collective bargaining in public employment in the
1960s, and since then legislators have awarded ever greater salaries and
benefits in exchange for election support. This has brought many
American states and cities to the brink -- and Detroit *over* the brink
-- of bankruptcy.

It is a somewhat hackneyed quotation, but we should remember Louis D.
Brandeis's observation that "a state may, if its citizens choose, serve
as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without
risk to the rest of the country." At stake in the fight over Obamacare
is the end of those labs.

*Paul Moreno holds the William and Berniece Grewcock chair in
constitutional history at Hillsdale College.*
