### Massive open online forces

The rise of online instruction will upend the economics of higher education

UNIVERSITIES have not changed much since students first gathered in
Oxford and Bologna in the 11th century. Teaching has been constrained by
technology. Until recently a student needed to be in a lecture hall to
hear the professor or around a table to debate with fellow students.
Innovation is eliminating those constraints, however, and bringing
sweeping change to higher education.

Online learning takes many forms. Wikipedia, a user-generated online
encyclopedia, contains wonderfully detailed explanations. YouTube offers
instruction on how to boil an egg as well as lectures on cosmology.
Within many universities the online is displacing the offline.
Professors publish course materials and videos of their lectures on the
web. Students interact with each other and submit assignments by e-mail.
Even those living on university campuses may nonetheless learn largely
online, skipping lectures and reporting only for the final exam.

    Education](/topics/distance-and-online-education)

In America, bowing to the inevitable, universities have joined various
startups in the rush to provide stand-alone instruction online, through
Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs. Though much experimentation lies
ahead, economics can shed light on how the market for higher education
may change.

Two big forces underpin a university’s costs. The first is the need for
physical proximity. Adding students is expensive—they require more
buildings and instructors—and so a university’s marginal cost of
production is high. That means that even in a competitive market, where
price converges towards marginal cost, modern education is dear.

It is also hard to raise productivity. University lecturers can teach at
most a few hundred students each semester—the maximum that can be
squeezed into lecture halls and exam-marking rosters. Because it is so
labour intensive higher education relies on large numbers of instructors
paid relatively modest salaries.

MOOCs work completely differently. Alex Tabarrok, an economist at George
Mason University and co-founder of an online-education site, Marginal
Revolution University, reckons the most salient feature of the online
course is its rock-bottom marginal cost: teaching additional students is
virtually free. The fixed cost of creating an online course is
relatively high, however. Getting started means putting together a
curriculum, producing written and recorded material to explain it, and
creating an interactive site that facilitates discussion and feedback.

Having invested in the production of a course, a provider’s incentive is
to sell it to as many students as possible. After the initial cost is
covered each additional unit sold is pure profit. A low price maximises
registrations and profit. But as prices converge towards marginal cost,
there will be little scope for undercutting the competition. Instead
MOOCs are likely to compete on quality, Mr Tabarrok reckons. Higher
production costs are a small price to pay to attract much greater
numbers of students. Such markets often evolve into winner-take-all,
“superstar” competitions. The best courses attract the most customers
and profit handsomely as a result. In this respect online education may
more closely resemble information industries such as film-making than
service industries such as hair-cutting.

The market for textbooks already fits this description. New textbooks
are costly to write and design but can be reproduced fairly cheaply. Not
surprisingly, only four introductory economic texts account for half of
the American market, according to Mr Tabarrok. Indeed, says Tyler Cowen,
a co-founder of Marginal Revolution University, it is possible that
textbook publishers are better equipped than universities to develop
MOOCs profitably.

The market for instructors will also be transformed. The best teachers
will be fabulously productive, reaching hundreds of thousands of
students. There may therefore be far fewer of them, each compensated
like superstars in the entertainment industry.

MOOCs’ low marginal cost is responsible for some of the bad press they
occasionally receive. Consumers risk little by signing up, so both
registrations and drop-out rates are high. Yet that is not necessarily a
reflection of poor quality. An analysis of over 1000 studies of
online-course results conducted by America’s Department of Education
found that people who complete such courses do better on average than
students in face-to-face instruction.

Ivory glowers

Caroline Hoxby, an economist at Stanford University, argues that MOOCs
threaten different universities in different ways. Less selective
institutions are close substitutes for MOOCs. Course content is often
standardised and interaction with professors is limited in order to keep
costs down. Students generally pay the cost of their education
themselves and upfront, but drop-out rates are nonetheless high. MOOCs
can provide a similar experience with more flexibility and at much less
cost. Though some such institutions could prosper as portals for courses
developed elsewhere, or by awarding degrees based in part on mastery of
MOOCs, most are at serious risk of displacement.

Elite institutions face very different circumstances, Ms Hoxby reckons.
They operate like venture-capital firms, offering subsidised,
labour-intensive education to highly qualified students. They aim to
cultivate a sense of belonging and gratitude in students in order to
recoup their investment decades later in the form of donations from
successful alumni.

Ironically, these universities may have threatened their own business
model by embracing MOOCs. Online courses break the personal link between
students and university and, if offered cheaply to outsiders, may make
regular graduates feel more like chumps than the chosen few. For top
schools, the best bet may simply be to preserve their exclusivity.
