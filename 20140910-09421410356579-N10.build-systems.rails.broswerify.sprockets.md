[Rails asset pipeline with ES6 modules and browserify](/questions/20612651/rails-asset-pipeline-with-es6-modules-and-browserify)
================================================================================================================================

**2**

I'm trying to implement something with the rails asset pipeline that is
proving harder than I'd hoped.

In order to structure the app cleanly, I plan to use a module system for
the javascript. For this I want to use CommonJS modules, but I'd like to
write them using the new ES6 syntax for future compatibility.

I've found the ES6 module transpiler extension for the asset pipeline,
which works well, but this only converts it into the CommonJS format. I
still need to get this into JS that the browser understands. For that
I'm looking at using Browserify but my problem lies in combining these
2.

The module transpiler works in a per file basis, but browserify works by
checking all of the files needed. The problem is that browserify can't
use the original files as they're no in CommonJS format, they're in ES6,
so it needs the transpiled versions, but because that happens in the
pipeline, I can't point browserify at a file.

Are there any ways around this?

You can try the
[hsume2-browserify-rails](https://rubygems.org/gems/hsume2-browserify-rails)
however [I discovered today it is broken for the current browserify node
module](https://github.com/hsume2/browserify-rails/issues/13) -- I had
to use 3.33.1 (others might work). I have yet to generate the assets as
one would for a production deploy to verify it works as expected but it
does work locally (after downgrading browserify).

I do like Seth Vincent's approach (as linked in the other response)
however it presents some problems. The biggest one is that one needs to
hook into asset generation and/or check in the generated JavaScript
bundles.

For ES6, you would use a `transform` such as this one:

Hey. I've already got the browserify running through the asset pipeline
and it works very well. My only issue is that I can't seem to have it
wait until the other sprockets processors have processed the file (such
as erb or in my case, ES6) and then have browserify process that output.

@PaReeOhNos Do you have some code? Maybe example git repo? I'm not
having that problem but my use case is pretty simple -- just .js files.
I would ask why are you putting JavaScript in erb? Not sure on ES6
(would like to see example). I've been working on browserify-rails -- it
and browserify definitely still have some pain points. –

I'm not so much using ERB specifically, more just as an example. But the
ES6 extension works in the same way. i.e you give the files an es6.js
extension. My issue lies in that browserify rails works over all of the
javascript files, however all of my files were in ES6 format, so I
needed to run browserify on the source AFTER it had been processed by
the ES6 processor. I've since dropped the ES6 as I couldn't find a clean
solution as I was hoping to keep it entirely in the asset pipeline –

@PaReeOhNos Browserify supports transforms so the browserify way to do
this would be to use something like this:
[github.com/thlorenz/es6ify](https://github.com/thlorenz/es6ify) -- I've
added support for configuration to browserify that would let you add
`--transform` as needed. It isn't into master yet. –
[Cymen](/users/122868/cymen "4271 reputation") Apr 14 at 15:10

Will definitely look at that. I couldn't find that when I started work
on it, only ones like coffeeify, so glad to see that's available now :)

You might want to try [Seth
Vincent's](http://learnjs.io/blog/2014/03/17/using-browserify-with-rails/)
approach, where he uses package.json, and npm scripts to run all
JavaScript tasks, and only uses bundle.js in the asset pipeline. You
could then shell out to npm tasks from your Rakefile. I like his
approach because it opens up the modern JS tool chain for JS tasks.

Looks like a nice approach. I'll take a look :) –

The ugly parts with this are you need 3 files (1 for sprockets, 1 for
CommonJS and 1 for the output of browserify aka the 'bundle') and then
you also need to check the generated bundle into source code or cover
all the ways of starting Rails to be sure that the bundle gets
generated... Even if you fix that, you still have two files. Not
horrible and I do like being isolated from RoR but something to think
about. – [Cymen](/users/122868/cymen "4271 reputation") Apr 3 at 18:54
