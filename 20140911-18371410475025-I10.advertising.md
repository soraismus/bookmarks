[Indie Ads on The New Disruptors](/blog/2014/5/27/indie-ads-on-the-new-disruptors)
==================================================================================

Hi, folks! This podcast is a labor of love, but it has hard and soft
costs to keep episodes flowing: hosting, an audio engineer, my time,
equipment, travel, and other expenses. So far, we've relied on a
combination of advertising and patronage (collected via
[Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/newdisruptors)).

We have had an array of wonderful sponsors this year whose products
align with things listeners are interested in. But because I vary the
podcasts' guests so much across areas of art, music, industrial design,
production, commerce, and so forth, we're not a perfect fit for sponsors
who want to define and reach the same sort of person consistently, such
as graphic designers or small-batch whiskey producers. This has led to
fertile times full of ads alternating with fallow ones.

So we're going to try something new by offering [**indie
ads**](http://newdisrupt.org/indie-ads/indie-product-ads). If you're an
independent maker, creator, programmer, or what-have-you, **you can get
a 30-second ad on New Disruptors for $50 and a 60-second ad for $100**
read during the main body of the podcast. I'm treating companies of 1 to
10 people as "independent," and the goal by limiting the length is to
provide enough detail to listeners and have the space for a few ads
without filling up the show too much. (Our full-price ads run around two
to three minutes for the "midroll" spots during a podcast.)

We have **5,000 to 15,000 listeners per episode** within the first eight
weeks after a show airs, and some episodes continue to rack up hundreds
of listens months later.

I read all the ads and will work with you to craft copy that works and
fits. These "live reads" provide the intimacy of old-time radio that
listeners like, and give me a chance to explain in a natural voice why a
given product or service is worthwhile.

To help make this work, Cards Against Humanity is buying a sponsorship
slot on every episode that we devote to indie ads, which gives us the
financial underpinning to make it affordable. CAH in general and Max
Temkin in particular have worked hard to provide opportunities for other
independent creators even as they've grown in scale, and I thank him and
them for helping out.

Who would this be good for? Anyone selling games, mobile apps, mobile
services, or interesting designer-led products. I know from talking to
hundreds of listeners that they're passionate about things made by one
or a few people that are guided by strong design and engineering
principles.

You can [contact me directly](mailto:nd@newdisrupt.org) if you have
questions, or [sign up and
pay](http://newdisrupt.org/indie-ads/indie-product-ads) by credit card
(via Stripe) for a 30-second or 60-second ad [via this
form](https://newdisruptors.squarespace.com/indie-ads/indie-product-ads),
in which you can provide all the details and I can follow up on timing
and the content of the ad. (I can also accept alternate payment.)

    @[newdisruptors](https://twitter.com/newdisruptors) Oct 2
    (indefinite hiatus). It’s been a great run, but not enough listeners
