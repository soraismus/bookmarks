[javascript integration testing for one page applications](/questions/12158163/javascript-integration-testing-for-one-page-applications)

****

I am currently developing a one page javascript application using
Sinatra Ruby on server side and Backbone.js, jQuery, jQuery UI for the
client side. The application main purpose is to allow a customer to
view/edit different kind of items, each item view being a more or less
complicated form.

To make sure everything works right I am planning to do:

-   unitary tests using QUnit
-   functional/integration tests

What frameworks/tools do you recommend for integration testing in this
case ? I started with Selenium but I didn't like it too much. I just
started to look at PhantomJS and CasperJS and they seem pretty nice for
basic stuff like navigating, clicking on links, ...

What's your advice ?

You didn't say what you didn't like about Selenium, but I'm guessing you
are confident with JavaScript, so my recommendation would be to use
[CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) as the main tool. It does work well
with one-page web apps, and comes with its own testing tool. The code
can still get a bit convoluted at times, when using nested `wait`
clauses; deal with that by making sure you don't try to do too much in
each test, and then if still complex, refactor. And don't forget
design-for-testing: if your selector is horribly complex, consider
adding a `<span id="xxxx">...</span>` around it, so your tests can go
straight to it!

You can use CasperJS with both [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) and
[SlimerJS](http://slimerjs.org/). My preference is for SlimerJS
currently, as:

-   PhantomJS 1.x is stuck on an old WebKit (equivalent to Safari 5.1
    and Chrome 13), so testing any more modern features is frustrating.
-   SlimerJS can either work with the Gecko engine, or directly with a
    version of Firefox you have installed. This allows you to configure
    a Firefox profile with extra plugins, security certificates, etc.
-   SlimerJS is written in JavaScript, so easier to hack if you have the
    need.

Once PhantomJS 2.0 comes out (around the end of 2013, hopefully), or if
your site does not rely on any recent HTML5 APIs, you can run CasperJS
twice, to get double coverage. (BTW, PhantomJS is naturally headless;
SlimerJS needs to use [Xvfb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb), which
is Linux or Mac only.)

What [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) gives you extra is you can
control other browsers, IE in particular. (Though of course for IE you
need to run a Windows machine.) Selenium, like SlimerJS, needs Xvfb to
be headless (again, excluding Windows). (BTW, the Selenium docs [on
supported
browsers](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/about/platforms.jsp#browsers) has
not been updated in ages, but I'm assuming later versions of each
browser have at least the same support shown there.)

The first point against Selenium is its speed. It is very slow. –

@user337620 My Selenium scripts are dominated by network access, so I've
never perceived them as slow, except to start-up. I just realized your
question was August last year, not this year! What did you end up going
with, and are you happy with it? – [Darren

I used CasperJS with PhantomJS. I will have a look at SlimerJS too. –
