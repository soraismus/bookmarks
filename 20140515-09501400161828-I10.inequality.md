On Income Inequality: A French Economist Vs. An American Capitalist
===================================================================

Picture a cozy cafe. At a small table, an economics professor from Paris
is chatting with a wealthy businessman from New York.

As they sip coffee, they discuss economic history, and often nod and
agree.

Then, as they stand to leave, each states a conclusion drawn from their
conversation. But what they say is exactly, completely opposite.

One says economic history proves governments must impose very heavy
taxes to break up concentrations of wealth. The other says governments
should cut taxes to encourage wealthy people to pursue even bigger
profits.

Huh? Why such different conclusions about the future when they agreed on
the past?

Let's go back to the beginning and eavesdrop — and then decide whose
conclusion makes the most sense. You can vote at the bottom of this
story.

First, meet the debaters:

The professor is [Thomas
Piketty](http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5592198/the-short-guide-to-capital-in-the-21st-century),
author of *Capital in the Twenty-First Century*, a runaway best-seller
about income inequality.

![Businessman Edward Conard, author of Unintended Consequences, says
governments should cut taxes to encourage wealthy people to pursue even
bigger
profits.](http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2014/05/09/conrad-8623b168062890ff99d8d6ce4458b90b3402a243-s6-c30.jpg "Businessman Edward Conard, author of Unintended Consequences, says governments should cut taxes to encourage wealthy people to pursue even bigger profits.")

governments should cut taxes to encourage wealthy people to pursue even
bigger profits.

Bloomberg/Getty Images

The businessman is [Edward
Conard](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/magazine/romneys-former-bain-partner-makes-a-case-for-inequality.html?pagewanted=all),
author of *Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told
About the Economy Is Wrong*, a 2012 book about the role of investors.
From 1993 to 2007, Conard was a partner at Bain Capital — the firm made
famous by another partner, Mitt Romney.

In real life, Piketty and Conard may not be hanging out together, but
their books can allow them to debate. Here is an imaginary conversation,
drawn directly from what they wrote.

*The discussion begins with the men agreeing that during a golden era —
from roughly 1950 to 1980 — wealth inequality receded as the middle
class expanded.*

**CONARD:**"In the 1950s and 1960s, an explosion of great corporate
jobs, together with a restricted supply of labor, produced healthy wage
growth."

**PIKETTY:** "The high growth rates observed in all the developed
countries in the post-World War II period were a phenomenon of great
significance, as was the still more significant fact that all social
groups shared in the fruits of growth."

*The two agree that the good times were based on conditions unique to
that period — when labor was in short supply because of the birth-rate
plunge of the 1930s and death-rate increase of the war-torn 1940s. In
addition, the great fortunes of earlier eras had gotten battered by
depression, war and war-related taxes. It wasn't until the 1950s that
the global economy could rebuild, and this rising economic tide started
lifting all boats. But the era couldn't last.*

**CONARD:** "After the post-war catch-up, advanced economies saw their
growth slow and their unemployment rise ... . Free trade weakened labor
unions' monopolies on the supply of labor for industries such as steel,
auto manufacturing ... "

![French economist Thomas Piketty, author of Capital in the Twenty-First
Century, says governments must impose heavy taxes to break up
concentrations of
wealth.](http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2014/05/09/487565697-7b853fa33d0c8cb767015ab6181b2af2078eb19c-s6-c30.jpg "French economist Thomas Piketty, author of Capital in the Twenty-First Century, says governments must impose heavy taxes to break up concentrations of wealth.")

Century,* says governments must impose heavy taxes to break up
concentrations of wealth.

Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images

**PIKETTY:** "We subsequently see a rapid rise in inequality in the
1980s ... the magnitude of the change is impressive."

*Both men agree it would be unrealistic to try to reproduce**post-World
War II**conditions. Conard said it best:*

**CONARD:** "The United States was prosperous for a unique set of
reasons that are impossible to duplicate today."

*But now here's where they part company.*

*Conard concludes that in today's world, the engine of growth is
technological innovation. Income concentration is good for everyone
because 1-percenters can afford to invest
in**breakthrough**technologies. And it was their investment in Silicon
Valley that created good jobs from 1990 to 2008, he**says**.*

**CONARD:** "The United States ran the table on Internet innovations,
creating companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Intel, Apple,
Cisco, Twitter, Amazon, eBay, YouTube and others. Europe and Japan
scarcely contributed."

*His bottom line is simple: Only people with big fortunes can afford to
take the big risks that keep innovation going. And while investors do
make a lot of money, most of the rewards are widely dispersed among the
99 percent — in the form of radically cheaper, faster ways to shop,
communicate, work and entertain, he says.*

**CONARD:** "The willingness to take risk is largely a function of
wealth. ... An increase in risk taking accelerates the growth of the
economy. [Therefore, Congress should] ... accelerate the accumulation of
equity by lowering marginal tax rates."

*Piketty comes to the opposite conclusion:**Unless**governments use
heavy taxes to break up concentrations of wealth, the economy will
become increasingly unbalanced, with only a few people inheriting
massive fortunes.*

*Rather than take investment risks and innovate, the hereditary elite
will become complacent monopolists who try to hang on to the status quo.
And average people will become discouraged. It will make more sense to
focus on marrying into wealth rather than on working hard.*

**PIKETTY:** "Capital reproduces itself faster than output increases.
The past devours the future. ... The right solution is a progressive
annual tax on capital. This will make it possible to avoid an endless
inegalitarian spiral while preserving competition and incentives for new
instances of primitive accumulation."

['If You Had 50,000 Angry People Coming Across The River, You Think

*And Piketty notes that in a democracy, all citizens can vote. So if
rich people want political backing for pro-business policies, they
should support higher taxes to pay for programs that would win over
poorer voters. Higher taxes would allow for more government spending on
health care, schools, roads, housing and food stamps for voters
struggling in the modern economy.*

*Consider the example of free-trade policies. Right now, Senate
Democrats are blocking the trade agreements favored by businesses
because they know many voters fear foreign competition. Why vote for
trade pacts that help wealthy investors but cut jobs and wages for
low-skilled factory workers?*

**PIKETTY:** "Globalization weighs particularly heavily on the least
skilled workers in the wealthy countries. ... The progressive tax is
indispensable for making sure that everyone benefits from globalization,
and the increasingly glaring absence of [heavy] progressive taxation may
ultimately undermine support for a globalized economy."

*In contrast, Conard says voters just needed to be better educated about
free trade, which brings poorer consumers big savings in the form of
much cheaper goods.*

**CONARD:** "Making products for $17 an hour that we could have
purchased for 75 cents an hour wastes resources that we could have used
elsewhere."

And so ends the fantasy conversation. (As the men head out of the cafe,
the rich guy reaches for the tab.) Now you pull up a chair. Get your
coffee, think hard — and vote. Who wins the debate?
