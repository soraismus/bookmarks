Genes and intelligence

### The 3% solution

A potent source of genetic variation in cognitive ability has just been discovered

PEOPLE are living longer, which is good. But old age often brings a
decline in mental faculties and many researchers are looking for ways to
slow or halt such decline. One group doing so is led by Dena Dubal of
the University of California, San Francisco, and Lennart Mucke of the
Gladstone Institutes, also in San Francisco. Dr Dubal and Dr Mucke have
been studying the role in ageing of klotho, a protein encoded by a gene
called *KL*. A particular version of this gene, *KL-VS*, promotes
longevity. One way it does so is by reducing age-related heart disease.
Dr Dubal and Dr Mucke wondered if it might have similar powers over
age-related cognitive decline.

What they found was startling. *KL-VS* did not curb decline, but it did
boost cognitive faculties regardless of a person’s age by the equivalent
of about six IQ points. If this result, just published in *Cell
Reports*, is confirmed, *KL-VS* will be the most important genetic agent
of non-pathological variation in intelligence yet discovered.

Dr Dubal and Dr Mucke made their discovery when they looked at 220
volunteers aged 52 to 85, to study the effects of *KL-VS* on ageing.
They assessed their volunteers’ faculties of memory, attention,
visuo-spatial awareness and language. From these, they constructed a
composite measure of cognition.

That measure suggested people with a *VS* version of the *KL* gene in
their chromosomes had better cognition than those without one. When they
analysed data collected by two other groups who work independently on
*KL-VS* they discovered these researchers had found the same thing. That
comparison brought the number of people examined to 718, a fifth of whom
were possessors of *KL-VS*.

The six-point IQ gap is an extrapolation, since the cognitive tests did
not measure general intelligence directly. But if it is correct,
variation in the *KL* gene could account for as much as 3% of the
variation of IQ in the general population (or, rather, in the population
from which the researchers’ samples were drawn, namely white Americans).
In comparison, the previous record-holders, *HMGA2* and *NPTN*, each
account for only half a percent of that variation.

This sort of result, it must be cautioned, has a tendency to come and
go. The genome has so many genes in it that flukey correlations between
one of them and some human trait are common. But there are two reasons
to believe this is not a fluke. One is that these three independent
studies have found it. The second is that Dr Dubal and Dr Mucke did not
rest on their laurels, but did some experiments on mice to investigate
*KL-VS*’s actions.

Up the junction

To do this they added the murine equivalent of *KL-VS* to the genomes of
some mice. Doing this increases klotho levels in mice (an effect also
seen in *KL-VS-*positive people). The genetically engineered animals did
much better than regular mice at learning how to navigate mazes and
other memory tests which psychologists like to inflict on their
subjects. And analysis of their brain tissue revealed differences from
regular mice in the structure of their synapses, the junctions between
nerve cells (illustrated above) that act as neural switches.

Signals cross synapses in chemical form. The most common messenger
chemical, known as glutamate, is picked up by the receiving cell using
molecules called NMDA receptors. It is known from previous work that
glutamate stimulation of NMDA, or the lack of it, can strengthen or
weaken synaptic connections. This is believed to be the basis of memory.

The team’s genetic engineering changed the nature of the NMDA receptors
in the mice’s hippocampuses and frontal cortices—two regions of the
brain particularly involved in memory formation—by doubling in them the
number of a particular sort of molecular subunit, GluN2B. Previous
research has found links between GluN2B levels and cognitive
performance. Dr Dubal and Dr Mucke discovered that blocking GluN2B with
a drug called ifenprodil abolished the genetically engineered mice’s
advantage. That suggests klotho works its magic, at least in part, by
increasing the number of GluN2B subunits in the NMDA receptors of the
brain’s memory and learning circuits.

Dr Dubal and Dr Mucke hope, despite their failure to show any protective
effect of *KL-VS* on age-related cognitive decline, that this knowledge
may be put to use. A drug that elevates klotho levels, or mimics that
protein’s function, might indeed enhance cognition, and there is no
obvious reason why such a drug should be restricted to the elderly. If
it could be developed everyone—except, maybe, those already in
possession of a copy of *KL-VS* in their genes—might be able to take
pills to make themselves a little brighter.
