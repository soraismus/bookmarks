The Man Who Predicted Google Glass Forecasts The Near Future
============================================================

by [Elise Hu](http://www.npr.org/people/144449221/elise-hu)

July 11, 201312:02 PM ET

Google Glass isn't even available to the public yet. But the wearable
technology that packs a tiny computer into a lightweight frame has
already faced
[mockery](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/05/06/181623462/video-snl-tries-on-google-glass),
condemnation, fear and [threats of
regulation](http://www.fastcompany.com/3009432/tech-forecast/tracking-the-ban-on-google-glass).
As NPR's Steve Henn [reported in
May](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/05/13/183468218/google-fights-glass-backlash-before-it-even-hits-the-street):

> "Right now, Google Glass might be the world's worst spy camera; if you
> go out in public with a pair on, you are guaranteed to attract
> attention. Still, the idea of techies mounting a tiny screen and a
> little camera to their faces makes millions of people uncomfortable.
> According to Sarah Rotman Epps, a tech analyst at Forrester Research,
> that is why Google is rolling out Glass to the world slowly in stages.
>
> " 'Google has been incredibly transparent ... with their Glass
> rollout,' Epps says. They realize that Google Glass will require
> shifting social norms to be accepted."

Glass technology may be relatively new to us, but wearable lenses that
overlay data and record video is a decades-old idea in the minds of
science fiction writers. In physicist and author David Brin's 1990
novel, *Earth,*characters wore "True-Vu goggles" to surveil and record
"youngsters."

And the way society has reacted to wearable technology is what Brin
wrote about in his 1998 book, *The Transparent Society: Will Technology
Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?* It went on to win the
American Library Association's Freedom of Speech Award.

One of our [@NPRAllTech](http://www.twitter.com/npralltech) friends on
Twitter suggested that we reach out to Brin, a Hugo and Nebula
award-winning physicist and inventor, after I [discussed Google
Glass](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/07/09/200030825/arrest-caught-on-google-glass-reignites-privacy-debate)
on *All Things Considered* this week. So I called up Brin, and in a
freewheeling conversation, we talked about everything from restaurant
design to Judy Garland to Sun Yat-sen. But here are his takeaways on the
frontier of Google Glass:

**Like every other generation, "grouches" will fear this new
technology.**

"Every generation has been challenged by new powers of vision, memory,
perspective, attention and reach," says Brin. He cites inventions as old
as Gutenberg's printing press for evidence. "The press was originally
used for pamphleteering," he reminds us, which in the short term, made
it seem like it was degrading the public discourse. And as [Time
recently reminded
us](http://ideas.time.com/2013/05/22/fears-of-google-glass-are-unfounded/#ixzz2YfRHgQNw),
Kodak cameras, after first being introduced in the late 1800s, were
banned from beaches and feared by those who valued privacy. In recent
decades, Google's core product, the search engine, has also been subject
to considerable consternation. (Remember *The Atlantic* cover story,
['Is Google Making Us
Stupid?'](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/))

"Every time this [technological change] happens, grouches proclaimed
that humans were never meant to do this, that we never evolved to or
weren't created to handle that kind of information flow. They were
always right in the short term. The transcendentalists who would claim
this would make us bigger, better and wiser were always wrong in the
short term."

**Augmented reality will likely lead to casualties.**

Mainly because distracted drivers will get into accidents or distracted
lens wearers could walk off curbs or into moving vehicles. As Brin says,
"Duh."

**Most of us will become easily identifiable to one another.**

Brin imagines a society in which Google Glass and similar devices are
available to all of us, which then help identify us, as well. So you
could potentially put on your glasses, walk down the street, and
everyone would have "electronic name tags" on, along with background
data about one another. "You'd never be at a loss," says Brin.

**We won't need wallets anymore.**

Wallets are full of "objects for reputation," says Brin. Items like your
identification, or credit cards, will become unnecessary in a world
where you wear your data, and that means you enter into situations
already knowing one another's reputations.

**Handshake deals will come back in a big way.**

Since everything could potentially be recorded, you could make a
handshake deal "like in the village of old," says Brin. If your business
partner's specs record the deal and yours do, too, that's two copies of
the same transaction.

**Governments will be tempted to legislate Glass and similar
technologies, but regulation can't keep up with technology.**

"What's going to happen in the next 10 years is disruptions and
disappointments that will cause people to be tempted to legislate
against these things," Brin says. "The first impulse has to do with
privacy." But, he says, regulation will never keep up with the speed of
technological innovation, so by the time Google Glass gets regulated,
Glass-type technology will be built into contact lenses, or into even
more conspicuous devices.

So Brin says if wearable technology will allow for some segment of
society, say, government, to "spy," then all of us should want and have
the same technology available. Society, he says, should refrain from
bans on Glass and similar technology so that everyone has a way to peer
at everyone else, making the background knowledge we have of one another
the normal rules of human engagement.

Brin wrote in 1988, "The world had a choice. Let governments control
surveillance tech ... and therefore give a snooping monopoly to the rich
and powerful ... or let *everybody* have it. Let everyone snoop on
everyone else, including snooping the government!"

So, what do you think about Brin's predictions and positions? We got
some great feedback from y'all on Monday about Google Glass catching its
first arrest. Leave us a note in the comments or [via
Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/npralltech), and I'll save them for a
future post.
