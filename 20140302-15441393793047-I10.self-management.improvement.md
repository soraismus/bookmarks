![How to Stop Giving a F\*ck What People
Think](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_ku-xlarge/19gta6183sbvdjpg.jpg)S

We're all guilty. Every day from the moment we wake up, we live our
lives caring what other people think of us.

***This post originally appeared on Medium.***

*Author's note:**This article was inspired by the work of [Julien
Smith](http://inoveryourhead.net/) and [The
Flinch](http://www.amazon.ca/The-Flinch-Julien-Smith-ebook/dp/B0062Q7S3S).*

We accept the status quo for what it is because everyone around us does.
We tip toe our way through life by doing things in order to please
others, not because it's what we believe in. Eventually our actions,
appearances, and lives become molded by how we think other people
perceive us. How are these pants going to make me look? What will my
colleagues think if I spoke out? Are those people talking shit behind my
back? If I take this job, what will my friends and family think of me?

Just writing that paragraph alone gave me a headache. It's exhausting.
It's dreadful. It has to stop. Living a life that follows the ideal
notions of what other people think is a terrible way to live. It makes
you become the spineless spectator who waits for other people to take
action first. It makes you become a follower. Worst of all, it makes you
become someone who doesn't take a stand for anything.

Today is the last day we live a life dictated by others. Today, we're
going to get to the bottom of the truth. Today is the day [we stop
giving a
F@$%](http://lifehacker.com/stop-caring-about-what-others-think-and-get-back-your-1493922746).

### No One Really Cares

Believe it or not, we're not that special. We go through our days
thinking about how other people might be judging us. But the truth
is—those people are thinking the exact same thing. No one in today's
"smartphone-crazed" society has time in their schedule to think more
than a brief second about us. The fact of the matter is, when we do have
time get our thoughts straight, we're too busy thinking about ourselves
and our own shortcomings—not others.

A [study done by the National Science
Foundation](http://www.mind-sets.com/html/mindset/thoughts.htm) claims
that people have, on average, 50,000 plus thoughts a day. This means
that even if someone thought about us ten times in one day, it's only
0.02%****of their overall daily thoughts. It is a sad but simple truth
that the average person filters their world through their ego, meaning
that they think of most things relating to "me" or "my." This means that
unless you have done something that directly affects another person or
their life, they are not going to spend much time thinking about you at
all.

I've always enjoyed watching performers trying to hustle for some change
at New York City train stations. These guys simply don't give a F@$%.
But the more interesting observation I made is how the spectators react.
Rather than watching the actual performers, most people are looking
around to see how other people are reacting. If people were laughing,
they would start laughing too. But if people weren't paying attention,
they would also pay no mind.

![How to Stop Giving a F\*ck What People
Think](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/19gt9crlphnyujpg.jpg)

Even when provided with the blatantly obvious opportunity to judge
someone, people are still thinking about how others may perceive them.
Once you understand that this is how people's minds works, it's a big
step towards freedom.

### You Can't Please Everyone

It's impossible to live up to [everyone's
expectations](http://lifehacker.com/5959129/stop-being-a-people-pleaser).
There will always be people—no matter what we say or how we treat
them—that will judge us. Whether you're at the gym, at work, taking the
train, or even online playing Call of Duty. Even now it's happening. You
will never be able to stop people from judging you, but you can stop it
from affecting you.

Think about the worst thing that could possibly happen when someone is
judging you or what you're doing. I guarantee that chances are—nothing
will happen. Absolutely nothing. No one is going to go out of their busy
lives to confront us, or even react for that matter. Because as I
mentioned before, no one actually cares. What will happen is that these
people will actually respect you for claiming your ground. They may
disagree with you, but they'll respect you.

Start standing up for what you believe in—causes, opinions, anything.
You're going to have people that disagree with you anyways, so why not
express how you truly feel? I've learned that it's better to be
loved****by a few people you care about, than to be liked by everyone.
These are family, friends, your spouse—the people who love you for who
you are, and the people who will be there for you during your worst
times. Focus on these people. They're the only people that matter.

### You Reap What You Sow

Worrying too much about what other people think can become a
self-fulfilling prophecy, because *the way we think starts to become the
way we behave*.

These individuals become
[people-pleasers](http://lifehacker.com/how-people-pleasers-can-learn-to-say-no-more-often-1524324151)
and are overly accommodating to others, thinking it will stop them from
being judged. In fact, the opposite is true. Most people don't like
push-overs and are turned off by it. The behavior we use in an attempt
to please others, can actually cause the opposing effect. This means
that if you're a push-over, then you're going to be attracting others in
your life who are also push-overs. Vice versa. This can be quite a
dangerous path to go down if you don't recognize its consequences.

It's been said that we are the average of the five people we hang out
with the most. When we start to attract and associate with the same
people that share our weaknesses —we're stuck. We stop growing, because
there's no one to challenge us to be better. We start thinking that this
is the norm and we remain comfortable. This is not a place you want to
be.

Now let's talk about the cure. Here are five ways to stop giving a F@$%.

Reclaiming Your Freedom
-----------------------

#### 1. Know Your Values

First and foremost. You need to know what's important to you in life,
what you truly value, and what you're ultimately aiming for. Once you
know who you really are and what matters to you, what other people think
of you becomes significantly less important. When you know your values,
you'll have something to stand up for —something you believe in.

You'll stop saying yes to everything. Instead, you'll learn to say no
when friends pressure you to go bar-hopping, or when a tempting business
opportunity distracts you from your business. When you have your values
straight, you have your shit straight.

#### 2. Put Yourself Out There

Now that you know what your values are, it's time to [put yourself out
there](http://lifehacker.com/5802583/why-new-experiences-are-important-and-positively-affect-your-perception-of-time).
This can be done several ways. Here are a few suggestions:

-   Blogging
-   Wearing a polka-dot sweater
-   Public Speaking
-   Flirting/Asking someone out

Keep in mind that when you're doing any of these activities, you have to
speak your mind. Be honest with yourself and what you share, because the
world doesn't need another conflict-avoider who does what everyone else
does.

#### 3. Surround Yourself with Pros

Surround yourself with people who are self-assured, and live life
without comprising their core values. These people will rub off on you
quickly.

One of my best friends, Cody, has been a big influence on me. Having
spent the summer with him, I've observed countless times where he
strongly voiced his opinion on controversial topics. What I learned was
that he was simply voicing opinions that people already had in their
heads, but were too afraid to voice. People admired him for being so
honest and direct, even when they disagreed with his views. Thanks for
not giving a F@$%, Cody.

#### 4. Create a "Growth List"

OK, now we're getting personal. I haven't told anyone this, but I have
this list called the "Growth List." A Growth List is comprised of all
the things in life that makes you uncomfortable. These are fears,
insecurities—anything that gives you the jitters. Here's how it works.

![How to Stop Giving a F\*ck What People
Think](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/19gt9crlovj60png.png)

You start by writing all the things that make you feel uncomfortable.
Then one-by-one, you do them. Once you complete the task, you move on to
the next. Repeat.

My first growth task was taking a cold shower (*The Flinch)*. I turned
the water as cold as it could get, and I could feel my body shake before
I even entered the shower. This was the inner bullshit voice in my head
talking. It was hard at first. But surprisingly, it got easier the
second time. Then even easier the third time. Before I knew it, my body
stopped shaking—I was no longer uncomfortable; I'd conquered my fear.

This exercise does wonders. I have yet to find a better way to get out
of my comfort zone. You can read all the books in the world about being
confident or getting over your fears, but if you don't take action,
you're just someone who's read how to ride a bicycle without ever having
ridden one.

#### 5. Travel Alone

If you're looking for an ultimate transformation that combines all of
the points above, you should [travel
alone](http://lifehacker.com/how-i-learned-to-love-traveling-solo-1296986417).
Traveling with other people can be fun, but you won't get the
opportunity to truly get out of your comfort zone. You'll be exposed to
different social cultures, break social norms that you didn't even know
existed, and ultimately, be forced to burst out of your small bubble.

Bring as little as possible, and fit everything into one backpack. Plan
nothing, except for a one-way flight ticket to your destination—figure
everything else out when you're there. Trust me, you'll be just fine. It
won't be easy initially, but don't get discouraged. Being comfortable
with the uncomfortable will grow with time. I continue to struggle with
it everyday, as do many others. But you need to get started today.

The world is already full of people who obey the status quo. But the
people who don't give a F@$% are the ones that change the world. Be the
latter. Start living life the way you want, be fearless like you once
were as a child, and always, always stand up for the truth. Someone has
to.
