If you want to get an earful about paying for college, listen to parents
from states where tuition and fees have skyrocketed in the last five
years. In Arizona, for example, parents have seen a 77 percent increase
in costs. In Georgia, it's 75 percent, and in Washington state, 70
percent.

Even in Oklahoma, where tuition increases have been among the lowest in
the nation, parents are dismayed. In Stillwater, Okla., Jeffery
Corbett's daughter is attending community college. Corbett, a fundraiser
for a nonprofit, says a high school diploma just won't get you very far.
And he knows; he doesn't have a college degree.

"I think about it all the time, because I realize [how] it has limited
me, by not having that piece of paper," he says.

And that, experts say, is the source of parents' frustration today. A
college education seems unaffordable at the worst possible time — when
"people are really struggling," says Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the
Urban Institute who has spent much of her career studying trends in
college costs.

"The unemployment rate is high. Nobody's wages have gone up in recent
years," she adds. "Increases in college tuition at public colleges,
particularly in recent years, have really been unacceptable. And there's
no question that that is a much higher percentage of median [family]
incomes than it used to be."

And yet, Baum says, somehow, families are paying for it. "And the reason
people are paying for it is because the return to the investment is so
high." No matter what a higher education costs them, most Americans
think it will be worth it, she says.

It was a different story 70 years ago, when most Americans thought
college was only for the wealthy elite. That changed after World War II
with the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, better known as the GI
Bill of Rights.

A newsreel from the Army-Navy Screen Magazine about the Servicemen's
Readjustment Act of 1944, designed to help World War II veterans pay for
college.

The law made college affordable for a group of veterans who never would
have thought of going beyond high school, says John Thelin, a professor
at the University of Kentucky and author of *A History of American
Higher Education*.

The GI Bill was an unexpected success, Thelin says, enrolling just under
8 million veterans — 10 times the number the authors of the bill had
predicted.

This sudden, enormous demand, Thelin adds, *could* have pushed college
costs higher — but didn't, because states embraced the idea. The booming
postwar economy allowed them to spend unprecedented sums of money to
expand higher education.

"The biggest problem that was facing governors and legislators was,
could we build campuses fast enough?" Thelin says.

While states were investing, the federal government was carving out a
new role for itself: helping families pay for college. It spawned the
National Defense Student Loan program, later called the Federal Perkins
Loan program, which did for civilians what the GI Bill had done for
veterans — and opened college gates even wider.

Then, with the civil rights movement as the backdrop, the landmark
Higher Education Act of 1965 pushed for greater college access for women
and minorities.

At the same time, Thelin says, from "1965 to 1972, colleges and
universities dug very deep into their own pockets to provide grants and
other forms of student financial aid in partnership with the new federal
programs."

Americans flocked to campuses with the expectation that the government
was going to foot part of the bill, and college did become affordable
for many more Americans.

But a turning point arrived around 1970, Thelin says. With double-digit
inflation, an oil embargo and a sputtering economy, a perfect storm
began to build. College tuition and fees climbed as much or more than
the inflation rate. Private loans, heavily subsidized by the federal
government, gradually replaced federal grants as the main source of
money for both poor and middle-class college students.

As family income fell, borrowing to pay for college took off, while
public investment in higher education dropped. Sandy Baum of the Urban
Institute says that drop has been the single biggest reason for the
increase in college costs.

"So it's not that colleges are spending more money to educate students,"
Baum says. "It's that they have to get that money from someplace to
replace their lost state funding — and that's from tuition and fees from
students and families."

While most institutions tried to keep costs down, Baum says, some took
advantage of the public perception that a high tuition means a quality
education.

"There's certainly evidence that people don't know how to measure the
quality of a college education," she says. "They think that if it's
expensive it must be better. I don't think colleges *want* to have high
prices, but I do think they see strategic reasons why it may be in their
interest to have high prices."

For the average family though, the pricing of a college education has
become a shell game. As colleges love to point out, there's the sticker
price and there's the real price. That's great for the few who can
navigate the labyrinth of financial aid sources and discounts that
institutions say they offer.

Experts say parents are slowly but surely becoming smarter consumers of
higher education and are helping their kids find less-expensive options
— like community college — while coming to the realization that a
college education never will be the entitlement that many Americans
thought it was 30 or 40 years ago.

That brings us back to those bewildered, if not wary, parents who see no
end to the rise in college costs. Parents like Heather Gillette, a
mother of two in suburban Seattle. Her daughter attends Washington State
University, where she's studying to be a veterinarian.

There was never any question that her kids would go to college, Gillette
says. The only question is what they would study. Even so, she says, "it
does come down to the parent making the decision about what they can
afford."
