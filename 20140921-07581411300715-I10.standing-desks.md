Most standing desks are pretty stationary. They assume you stay in one
place 9 to 5.

But many of us are mobile during the day. We visit customers or
colleagues, hang out in coffee shops, or work while traveling.

That's when you might want something that's not only standing, but also
portable. Something like StandStand, for instance.

Now on Kickstarter, StandStand is a three-piece wooden kit that locks
together into one sturdy platform for your laptop.

It weighs less than two pounds, flattens into one interconnected lump,
and costs as little as $50 as part of the campaign, which is
considerably less than most standing desks other than one you make
yourself.

Luke Leafgren, who works at Harvard University, came up with the idea
last year.

The product is available in three sizes: 9, 12 and 14 inches. A birch
finish costs $50, while a denser bamboo version costs $90. Shipment date
is set for December.

Leafgren is trying to raise $15,000, which will go mostly towards a
professional-grade CNC cutting machine.

[Fund This!](/section/fund-this)

Picture yourself being "that standing desk guy" not just at the office,
but at a coffee shop, library, and wherever else you happen to be.

There are a lot of standing desks on the market these days. But most of
them are pretty stationary. They assume you have the sort of job where
staying in place is what you have to do from 9 to 5.

Many of us need to be mobile during the day. We visit customers or
colleagues, hang out in coffee shops, or work while traveling. That's
when you might want something that's not only standing, but also
portable. Something like
[StandStand](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1875488582/standstand?ref=nav_search),
perhaps?

Now on Kickstarter, StandStand is a three-piece wooden kit that locks
together into one sturdy platform for your laptop. And very elegant it
is too. It weighs less than two pounds, flattens into one interconnected
lump, and costs as little as $50 if buying early through the
crowdfunding campaign, which is considerably less than most standing
desks (probably only building your own is cheaper).

The design comes from [Luke
Leafgren](//www.fastcompany.com/person/luke-leafgren), who makes his
case in the video here:

Leafgren, who works as a student advisor at Harvard, came up with the
idea last year. "One thing about my job is that I work in a lot of
different places. I have students in my office. I'm in the dining hall,
the library and cafes. I thought it would be great to have the option of
standing in all these places, so I tried to design something like a
laptop that I could take wherever I go."

The product is available in three sizes: 9, 12 and 14 inches. A birch
finish costs $50, while a denser bamboo version costs $90. Shipment date
is set for December.

Leafgren is trying to raise $15,000, which will go mostly towards a
professional-grade CNC cutting machine (the pieces are currently cut by
hand in Wisconsin).

There are other portable standing desks on the market, like the [Stork
Stand](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3032727/want-a-standing-desk-youre-sitting-on-one?partner=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=feedburner+fastcoexist&utm_content=feedburner),
which fits to the back of a chair. But Leafgren argues that his product
is usable in more situations and is cheaper and lighter (two pounds
compared to more than four pounds).

"It's more attractive than some of the designs out there and more
sturdy," he says. In tests, the StandStand held its own under 900 pounds
of evenly distributed weight. Which isn't bad for something lighter than
a laptop.

    That is so cool! And we love the wood too! We make another similar
    portable desktop for the vehicles. For the vehicularly inclined
    productive traffic jammers, or, anytime in the vehicle. D2D A.K.A.
    Dashboards to Desktops. Come See! We'll Saw!

    I think this is a good concept. Often we have laptop in the kitchen
    or at our desk at work or home that is at the wrong height (no
    ergonomic pull-out tray available). A lot of people suffer from
    shoulder and forearm pain because of the wrong angle of typing.
    Standing might be the ticket and is an option as this unit could
    easily fold down and be put under the desk if needed. I agree that
    the 900 pounds weight is a bit of a overkill; however, I would like
    to know if I could stand on it and use it as step stool also,
    thereby eliminating another piece of furniture. Would be great in
    those "little houses".

    I've stood on StandStand to test the strength, and people love to
    sit on them at parties. While I'm comfortable to do this safely at
    my own risk, it's not quite as stable as my kitchen step stool.

    I've been a "standing desk guy" since 1989. My workstations are
    designed to provide individual levels each for monitor, keyboard,
    mouse. Standing is a human's natural position. As a standup guy, I
    have never had back problems, nor neck strain, nor carpal tunnel
    issues. I just turned 79 and feel great!

    It certainly looks good so major kudos for design *appearance*.
    However for the other part of design, one of those sliding trade-off
    things seems obvious. Two pounds seems very small, but ask everyone
    who carries a laptop how they would feel about adding 2 pounds to
    the weight of the laptop.

    I also understand that rigidity is important, but the
    engineered/sandwiched material used is pretty good for that. Have
    they actually tried using a slightly thinner material that might
    still be suitably rigid and stable, weigh maybe 1.25 pounds and
    support a *mere* 300 pounds ? (900 is really silly isn't it ?)

    I don't have or know the material and certainly haven't done the
    math, but if this were my product to manage I would certainly
    investigate that direction.

    Thanks, DBJARRELL! A thinner material and lighter weight is
    definitely desirable. 3/8-inch plywood was the thinnest I could use
    in my prototypes while still avoiding any warping, and the
    super-strong rigidity was a surprising byproduct.

    Somehow i'm afraid bringing my laptop to STAND and work in a
    coffeeshop might come across a tad pretentious. Also, the danger of
    passing people knocking either the laptop of the stand or the stand
    of the desk.
