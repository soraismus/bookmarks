Moving From Backbone To React
=============================

We've been building a fairly big, interaction-heavy JavaScript app for
Propeller (you can check out a slice of it on our [homepage](/)). We
started with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) as the base for most of
our code, but we started to feel some pain at the view layer as our app
grew larger.

Then, just as we started to looking for new solutions,
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) appeared.

What is React? In effect, React is a replacement for `Backbone.View`.
It's not a huge application-level framework like Angular or Ember, and
it can peacefully coexist with existing components like
`Backbone.Model`.

Why did we replace `Backbone.View`? The biggest headache with vanilla
Backbone is once you start nesting `Backbone.View` objects, you're
basically on your own with regards to managing the lifecycle of the view
hierarchy.

See, for every subview, you have to remember to a) tear it down b)
respect its internal state when its parent is `#render`'d. You'll often
encounter code like this, if not more complex:

    ProfileView = Backbone.View.extend({
        render: function() {
            var template = _.template($("#profile-view-template").html());
            $(this.el).html(template);

            // Add a subview
            if (!this._avatarView) {
                this._avatarView = new AvatarView({model: this.model});
            }

            $(".avatar-container", this.el).html(this._avatarView.render().el);

            // ... Add a bunch of other subviews

            return this;
        },
        remove: function() {
            // Remove a subview
            this._avatarView.remove();

            // ... Remove a bunch of other subviews

            return Backbone.View.prototype.remove.apply(this, arguments);
        }
    });

Subviews involve a lot of easy-to-forget boilerplate that Backbone (by
design) doesn't automate. Libraries like
[Backbone.Marionette](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette)
offer more abstractions to make view nesting easier, but they're all
limited by the fact that Backbone delegates how and when view-document
attachment occurs to the application code.

React, on the other hand, manages the DOM and only exposes real nodes at
select points in its API. The "elements" you code in React are actually
objects which wrap DOM nodes, not the actual instances which get
inserted into the DOM. Internally, React converts those abstractions
into real DOMElements and fills the document accordingly.

To make that a little clearer, our `ProfileView` example turns into
something like this using React (without JSX, which we'll get to later):

    ProfileView = React.createClass({
        render: function() {
            return React.DOM.div({},
            [
                React.DOM.div({className: "avatar-container"},
                [
                    AvatarView({model: this.getModel()})
                ])
            ]);
        }
    });

    // Outside of your React code:
    var view = ProfileView({model: User.profile()});
    React.renderComponent(view, $("#profile-container")[0]);

Now our `AvatarView`'s clean-up code will be called automatically, and
successive calls to `ProfileView#render` will be intelligently diff'd to
update the DOM when necesssary. In other words, less memory leaks and
faster interfaces.

JSX
---

React also ships with JSX, a quasi-preprocessor-language. JSX is a
custom XML-ish syntax which compiles into vanilla JavaScript. Our
`ProfileView` example above would look more like this using JSX:

    /** @jsx React.DOM */
    ProfileView = React.createClass({
        render: function() {
            return (
                <div>
                    <div className="avatar-container">
                        <AvatarView model={this.getModel()} />
                    </div>
                </div>
            );
        }
    });

JSX makes React code easier to read and write when dealing with a
complex hierarchy, but it's not required. And since JSX elements get
converted to normal JavaScript, we can use them anywhere we would use
plain-old objects:

    /** @jsx React.DOM */
    UserListView = React.createClass({
        render: function() {
            var listElements = _.map(this.props.users, function(user) {
                return (<UserView user={user} />);
            });
            return (
                <ul>
                    { listElements }
                </ul>
            );
        }
    });

Migrating
---------

Once we figured out that React is what we were looking for, it was time
to move our classes over. The pattern for this is:

1.  Pick a `Backbone.View` subclass to migrate.
2.  Use our
    [react.backbone](https://github.com/usepropeller/react.backbone)
    helpers as a starting point.
3.  React-ify the code: change your `#render` code to use JSX, move code
    from `#initialize` to `#componentDidMount`, and move code from
    `#remove` to `#componentWillUnmount`.
4.  Convert the parent view to use `React.renderComponent` instead of
    something like `$.append`.

At Propeller, our JSX workflow is:

1.  Write JSX views in `.jsx` files
2.  Add a daemon to watch `.jsx` file changes
3.  When a change occurs, trigger the `jsx` tool to compile our files
    into `.js` variants:

<!-- -->

    // Monitors `.jsx` files in `js/views` and outputs the result to `js/views/_jsx`
    jsx ./js/views ./js/views/_jsx -x jsx

Those compiled `.js` files in `views/jsx` are what end up getting served
in our HTML files.

There is also an in-browser JSX compiler which will do this process at
runtime while your app loads, but I wouldn't recommend using it even for
rapid prototyping. It makes debugging crashes in your JSX snippets
challenging, as stack-traces often get mangled with the compiler's own
(sizable) implementation.

Gotchas
-------

React is used in production at Instagram (the entire page) and Facebook
(comments), so it's far from unstable, but there are still some quirks:

-   Say goodbye to your CSS `#id` selectors. React currently generates
    DOM element IDs on all React-generated elements, so your CSS and
    JQuery selectors will need to be changed to work with exclusively
    `.class`'s. Check out [Instagram's
    markup](//i.imgur.com/Xhs5jOC.png) to see what I'm talking about.
-   JSX looks like normal HTML, but it isn't. If you want to specify a
    custom DOM property (like `ng-something`), you'll need to do that in
    `#componentDidUpdate` with the actual DOMElement instance. React
    elements *will* accept DOM properties prefixed with `data-` or
    `aria-`, but if you have your own custom scheme you'll have to do it
    elsewhere.
-   As of React 0.3.2, you need to include that `/** @jsx React.DOM */`
    comment in all your JSX files for React's tools to work correctly,
    which took awhile to figure out the first time. There's an [open
    issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/114) about removing
    it on Github.

Worth It?
---------

We moved about 20 different Backbone view classes to React over the past
few weeks, including the live-preview pane that you see in our little
[iOS demo](/). Most importantly, it's allowed us to put energy into
making each component work great on its own, instead of spending extra
cycles to ensure they function in unison. For that reason, we think
React is a more scalable way to build view-intensive apps than Backbone
alone, and it doesn't require you to drop-everything-and-refactor like a
move to Ember or Angular would demand.
