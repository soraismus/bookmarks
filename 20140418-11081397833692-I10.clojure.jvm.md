Decompiling Clojure I
=====================

Apr 13th, 2014 | [Comments](#disqus_thread)

This is the first in a series of articles about decompiling Clojure,
that is, going from JVM bytecode created by the Clojure compiler, to
some kind of higher level language, not necessarily Clojure.

This article was written in the scope of a larger project, building a
better Clojure debugger, which I’ll probably blog about in the future.

These articles are going to build form the ground up, so you may skip
forward if you find some of the stuff obvious.

Clojure targets the JVM
=======================

To be more precise, there is a [Clojure compiler targeting the
JVM](https://github.com/clojure/clojure), there’s also one [targeting
Javascript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript), one for [the
CLR](https://github.com/richhickey/clojure-clr) and there are some less
known projects [targeting
lua](https://github.com/raph-amiard/clojurescript-lua) or [even
C](https://github.com/schani/clojurec).

But the official [clojure core](http://clojure.com/) efforts are mainly
on the JVM, which stands for *Java Virtual Machine*.

That means when you write some clojure code:

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2
3
~~~~

    (ns hello-world)

    (println "Hello World")

You won’t get a native binary, for instance a x86
[PE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301805.aspx) or
[ELF](http://www.skyfree.org/linux/references/ELF_Format.pdf) file,
although it’s entirely possible to write a compiler to do it.

When you target a particular runtime though, you usually get a different
set of functions to interact with the host, there’s a lot of language
primitives just to deal with [Java inter
operation](http://clojure.org/java_interop) which do not migrate easily
to other runtimes or virtual machines.

The JVM is about Java, or is it?
================================

This doesn’t mean that the JVM can *only* run programs written in Java.

In fact, Clojure doesn’t use Java as an intermediate language before
compiling, the Clojure compiler for the JVM generates [JVM
bytecode](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html)
directly [using the ASM library](http://asm.ow2.org/).

So, what does it mean the JVM is about Java if you can compile directly
to bytecode without a mandatory visit to [the kingdom of
nouns](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html)?

Besides its name, the JVM was designed by James Gosling in 1992 to
support the [Oak Programming
Language](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se5.0/html/Preface.doc.html),
before evolving into its current form.

Its main responsibility is to achieve independence from hardware and
operating system, and like a real machine, it has an instruction set and
manipulates memory at runtime, and the truth is the JVM knows nothing
about the Java Programming Language, it only knows of a particularly
binary format, [the class file
format](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html),
which contains bytecode and other information.

So, any programming language with features that can be expressed in
terms of a valid class file, can by hosted on the JVM.

But the truth is that the class file format, maintains a lot of
resemblance with concepts appearing in Java, or any other OO programming
language as a matter of fact, to name a few:

-   A `class` file corresponds to a Class
-   A `class` file has members
-   A `class` file has methods
-   Methods of the `class` file can be static or instance methods
-   There are primitive types and reference types, that can be stored in
    variables
-   Exceptions are an instance or subclass of `Throwable`
-   etc

So, we can say the JVM is **not** agnostic regarding the concepts
supported by the language, as [the LISP
machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_Machines) were not agnostic
either.

Clojure compiles to bytecode
============================

So we have a language like Clojure, with many concepts not easily mapped
to the JVM spec, but that it was mapped none the less, how?

Namespaces do not exist
-----------------------

Maybe you think Clojure namespaces correspond to a **class**, and each
method in the namespace is mapped to a method in the class.

Well, that is not the case.

Namespaces [were criticized
before](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/What-Sucks-about-Clojure-and-Why-You-ll-Love-It-Anyway)
for being tough, and the truth is they’re used for proper modularity,
but do not map to an entity in the JVM. They’re equivalent to java
packages or modules in other languages.

Each function is a class
------------------------

Each function in your namespace will get compiled to a complete
different class. That’s something you can easily confirm listing the
files under `target/classes` in a leiningen project directory.

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
~~~~

    git:(master) ✗ ls target/classes/

    config$fn__292.class
    routes__init.class
    config$loading__4910__auto__.class
    config$read_environment$fn__300.class
    config$read_environment.class
    config$read_properties$iter__304__308$fn__309$fn__310.class
    server
    server$_main.class
    server$_main$fn__4006.class
    server$fn__3939.class

You will find a `.class` file for each function you have defined,
`namespace$function.class` being the standard syntax.

Each anonymous function is also a class
---------------------------------------

As you saw in the previous listing, there are many functions with
numbers like `config$fn__292.class`.

Those correspond to anonymous functions that get their own class when
compiled, so if you have this code:

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
~~~~

    (map #(+ 34 %) (range 10))

You should expect a `.class` file for the anonymous function
`#(+ 34 %)`.

*class* files don’t need to be on disk
--------------------------------------

Many times you’ll find the `class` files on disk, but it doesn’t have to
be that way.

In many circumstances we’re going to be modifying the `class` structure
on runtime, or creating new `class` structures to be run, entirely on
memory. Even the compiler can `eval` some code compiling to memory
without creating a `class` file on disk.

What does bytecode look like?
=============================

For the first example, I selected a real simple clojure function

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
~~~~

    (defn test-multi-let
      []
      (let [a 1
            b 2
            c 3
            b 4]
        9))

To explore the bytecode we will use `javap`, simple, but does the job:

~~~~ {.line-numbers}

    javap -c target/classes/debugee/test\$test_multi_let.class
    ...
    public static {};
        Code:
           0: lconst_1
           1: invokestatic  #19                 // Method java/lang/Long.valueOf:(J)Ljava/lang/Long;
           4: putstatic     #21                 // Field const__0:Ljava/lang/Object;
           7: ldc2_w        #22                 // long 2l
          10: invokestatic  #19                 // Method java/lang/Long.valueOf:(J)Ljava/lang/Long;
          13: putstatic     #25                 // Field const__1:Ljava/lang/Object;
          16: ldc2_w        #26                 // long 3l
          19: invokestatic  #19                 // Method java/lang/Long.valueOf:(J)Ljava/lang/Long;
          22: putstatic     #29                 // Field const__2:Ljava/lang/Object;
          25: ldc2_w        #30                 // long 4l
          28: invokestatic  #19                 // Method java/lang/Long.valueOf:(J)Ljava/lang/Long;
          31: putstatic     #33                 // Field const__3:Ljava/lang/Object;
          34: ldc2_w        #34                 // long 9l
          37: invokestatic  #19                 // Method java/lang/Long.valueOf:(J)Ljava/lang/Long;
          40: putstatic     #37                 // Field const__4:Ljava/lang/Object;
          43: return

I’ve removed some extra information such as variable tables, we’re going
to be visiting those later.

What you see here are JVM *assembly instructions*, just a subset of the
JVM instruction set, generated by the Clojure compiler when feed with
the sample function above.

Before we get into more details, let me show you how that code looks
after a basic decompiler pass:

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2
3
4
5
~~~~

    0:a = 1
    2:b = 2
    6:c = 3
    11:b = 4
    16:RETURN 9

Prettier uh?

That is until you decompile this:

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2
3
4
5
~~~~

    (defn test-if
      []
      (if (= (inc 1) 2)
        8
        9))

And get this:

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2
3
~~~~

    0:IF (2 != clojure.lang.Numbers.inc(1)) GOTO 11 ELSE GOTO 18
    11:RETURN 9
    18:RETURN 8

Who was the moron that put a
[**BASIC**](http://groups.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/basic/basic.html)
in my Clojure!

Ain’t it?

Keep reading… there’s more to be seen ahead.

The operand stack
=================

I won’t dwell into many details about each JVM instruction and how that
translates to something resembling Clojure, or Basic for that matter,
but there’s one thing worth of mention, and that is the operand stack.

Frames
------

A new Frame is created each time a method is invoked and destroyed when
the method completes, whether that information is normal or abrupt
(throws an uncaught exception), frames are allocated in the JVM stack
and have its own array of local variables and its own operand stack.

If you set a breakpoint on your code, each different entry in your
thread callstack, is a frame.

Stack
-----

The operand stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack and its empty when
the Frame that contains it is created, and the JVM provides instructions
for loading constants or variables into the operand stack, and to put
values from the operand stack in variables.

The operand stack is usually used to prepare parameters to be passed to
methods and to receive method results, [as opposed to using registers to
do
it](http://markfaction.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/stack-based-vs-register-based-virtual-machine-architecture-and-the-dalvik-vm/).

So you should expect something along these lines:

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
~~~~

    f(a, b, c)

    => compiling to

    push a
    push b
    push c
    call f

So looking again at the bytecode of the previous function:

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2
3
4
5
~~~~

    (defn test-if
      []
      (if (= (inc 1) 2)
        8
        9))

Here:

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
~~~~

    public java.lang.Object invoke();
        Code:
           0: lconst_1
           1: invokestatic  #63                 // Method clojure/lang/Numbers.inc:(J)J
           4: ldc2_w        #42                 // long 2l
           7: lcmp
           8: ifne          18
          11: getstatic     #49                 // Field const__4:Ljava/lang/Object;
          14: goto          21
          17: pop
          18: getstatic     #53                 // Field const__5:Ljava/lang/Object;
          21: areturn

We can make ourselves an interpretation about what’s going on…

`lconst_1` is pushing the constant value `1` into the stack, then
calling a static method with `invokestatic`, as you’ve already guessed
that’s the `clojure.lang.Numbers.inc(1)` we saw on the *basic*
decompiler earlier.

Then `ld2_w` loads the value `2` into the stack and `lcmp` will compare
it against the function result, `ifne` tests for non equality and jumps
to line `18` if values differ.

One thing to consider here is that each entry on the operand stack can
hold a value of any JVM type, and those must be operated in ways
appropriate to their types, so many operations have a different
operation code according to the type they’re handling.

So looking at this example from the JVM specification, we see the
operations are prefixed with a `d` since they operate on `double`
values.

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2
3
4
5
~~~~

    Method double doubleLocals(double,double)
    0 dload_1 // First argument in local variables 1 and 2
    1 dload_3 // Second argument in local variables 3 and 4
    2 dadd
    3 dreturn

Which as you may have guessed, is adding double values `1` and `3`.

JVM auxiliary information
=========================

The JVM `class` format has support for some extra information that can
be used for debugging purposes, some of which you can get rid from your
files if you want.

Among those we find [the LineNumberTable
attribute](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.12)
and the [the LocalVariableTable
attribute](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.13),
which may be used by debuggers to determine the value of a given local
variable during the execution of a method.

According to the jvm spec, the table has the following structure inside
the `class` file format

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
~~~~

    LocalVariableTable_attribute {
           u2 attribute_name_index;
           u4 attribute_length;
           u2 local_variable_table_length;
           {   u2 start_pc;
               u2 length;
               u2 name_index;
               u2 descriptor_index;
               u2 index;
           } local_variable_table[local_variable_table_length];
       }

Basically it says which variable starts at which instruction: `start_pc`
and lasts for how long: `length`.

If we look at that table for our `let` example:

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
~~~~

    (defn test-multi-let
      []
      (let [a 1
            b 2
            c 3
            b 4]
        9))

We see how each variable is referenced against program counter(`pc`)
line numbers (do not get confused with source file line numbers).

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
~~~~

    LocalVariableTable:
          Start  Length  Slot  Name   Signature
                 2      17     1     a   J
                 6      13     3     b   J
                11       8     5     c   J
                16       3     7     b   J
                 0      19     0  this   Ljava/lang/Object;

One interesting thing though, is the `LineNumberTable`

~~~~ {.line-numbers}
1
2
3
~~~~

      public debugee.test$test_multi_let();
        LineNumberTable:
          line 204: 0

Which has only **one** line number reference, even if our function was 7
lines long, obviously that cannot be good for a debugger expecting to
step over each line!

Next post I’ll blog about the Clojure compiler and how it ends up
creating that bytecode, before visiting again the decompiling process.
