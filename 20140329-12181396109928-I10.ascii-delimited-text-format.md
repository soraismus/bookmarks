Text File formats – ASCII Delimited Text – Not CSV or TAB delimited text

Unfortunately a quick google search on “ASCII Delimited Text” shows that
IBM and Oracle failed to read the ASCII specification and both define
ASCII Delimited Text as a CSV format. ASCII Delimited Text should use
the record separators defined as ASCII 28-31.

The most common formats are CSV (Comma Separated Values) and tab
delimited text. Tab delimited text breaks when ever you have either a
field with a tab or a new line in it, and CSV breaks depending on the
implementation on Quotes, Commas and lines. Sadly Quotes, Commas and Tab
characters are very common in text, and this makes the formats extremely
bad for exporting and importing data. There are some other formats such
as pipe (|) delimited text, and whilst better in that | is less
frequently used they still suffer from being printable characters that
are entered into text, and worst of all people, when they look at a file
format and see the delimiter, think that it is a good idea to break
things up with in fields using the same delimiter as the file format.

The **most anoying thing** about the **whole problem** is that it **was
solved by design** in the **ASCII character set**.

If you use ASCII 31 as your field separator instead of comma or tab, and
ASCII 30 as your record separator instead of new line. Then you have a
text file format that is trivial to write out and read in, with no
restrictions on the text in fields or the need to try and escape
characters.

It is even part of the design of the file encoding system. The ASCII
standard calls these fields

-   31 Unit Separator
-   30 Record Separator

And ASCII has two more levels with Group and File Separators

-   29 Group Separator
-   28 File Separator

See
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit\_separator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_separator)
and\

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter\#ASCII\_Delimited\_Text](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter#ASCII_Delimited_Text)

In summary ASCII Delimited Text is using the last 4 control characters
(28-31) for their purpose as field and record delimiters and not using
CSV (Comma Separated Values)

1.  I’ve \*always\* wondered why nobody ever used these characters for
    non-hierarchical information, and I personally think XML is overkill
    in most applications.

    CSVs suffer from a standardization problem. Since this pretty much
    obviates the need for escaping except perhaps with BLOBs, I don’t
    know why nobody ever thinks to do it.

    Furthermore, terminals could print them if they really wanted to
    with a switch to allow easy reading. UTF-8 should continue to let us
    use them verbatim, so I don’t see that as a problem, either.

    I think the file and group chars were used on tapes; otherwise this
    has all been forgotten. Too bad, it would make life a lot easier.

3.  Good point.

    So, what if somebody decided to implement a ADT format should the
    ‘official’ format name remain specified as ‘ASCII Delimited Text’
    and what extension should these files carry?

    With the acceptance of the ASCII sub-set into UTF-8 I personally
    think just ‘Delimited Text’ would be more appropriate. The term
    ‘ASCII’ itself just feels anachronistic these days.

    I have actually implemented a complete (ie RFC 4801) CSV parser in
    Javascript and it was a complete pain in the ass.The RFC creates a
    decent initial baseline but it’s still missing 3 rules (involving
    handling null values) and it’s very challenging to implement.

    By far the worst case is where new-line characters are added as
    values (delimited by quotes). In that case, no variation of
    split([newlines]) will work without breaking. Getting around that
    takes nothing less than a FSM (Finite State Machine).

    Just for a sanity check I’m seriously debating whether I want to
    release a library that makes use of ASCII Delimited Text. I don’t
    see how any other text-based format could be more efficient and
    cross-platform compatible. It’s about time somebody steps up and
    creates a working implementation.

    If you have any interest, feel free to contact me.

    -   Thanks Evan,\
         My company @UK uses it for all our internal ETL activities
        since it is a simple clean way of tranfering data. I have been
        looking at it as a way of transfering xml data in a more
        efficent format. The problem is that XML has both Elements and
        Attributes, which are duplication that makes it more difficult
        to represent in a cleaner structure with out having to have a
        start/end tag.

        XML also has the maddest escape logic I have come across the
        only thing that should need escaped is < and it feels like lots
        and lots of arbitary chars are escaped.

        Regards Ronald

4.  Interesting.

    I’m not sure how your back-end works but if you’re exposing a REST
    service via a HTTP server you could always use intermediate gzip
    compression. If you use a data format where the attribute keys are
    made up of the column headers (ie there’s a lot of repetition) it
    shouldn’t be too hard to compress away most of the overhead that XML
    adds.

    XML is really intended to be used as a human-readable storage
    format. If you’re just exchanging internal data, I would personally
    use JSON. It’s much more compact, is optimized to be
    machine-readable, and you could find a (de)serializer implementation
    in just about any language.

    I have a working implementation of a data-specific XML micro format
    (serializable by python) for a proof-of-concept but haven’t publicly
    documented any details about it yet. Actually, I have a complete
    REST API service layer written for GAE (Google App Engine) that I
    eventually plan to document. A ASCII delimited format will probably
    be added at some point in the future.

    If you’re interested in hearing about it, feel free to email me or
