Rapid Development
=================

> “God help us; we’re in the hands of engineers.” Dr Ian Malcolm,
> Jurassic Park

The Startup Genome^[1](#fn1)^ project analysed data from thousands of
web start-ups to identify patterns of success, and found a common theme
among the 90% that failed. Of these unsuccessful start-ups, 70% had got
ahead of themselves and invested effort before it was needed, in what
the report calls premature scaling. This can manifest itself in many
ways, such as building features that are nice to have but not essential,
devoting time to product scalability before the app has evolved to fit
the market, and failing to solicit customer feedback regularly.

And so, while code characteristics like maintainability and scalability
are important, they are also something of a champagne problem: if
they’re your biggest headaches, it’s a good indication that your app has
successfully found it’s market.

It’s better to focus early development on immediate concerns to stand
the best chance of making it into the small winner’s circle. The Startup
Genome project found that problematic start-ups wrote over three times
more code than their successful counterparts in the first stage of
development^[2](#fn2)^.

\

For a new app, base your initial technology decisions on:

-   **Ease of development:** there may only be a 10% chance of success,
    but this drops to 0% if you don’t start or complete the app. Make
    the development as straightforward as possible.
-   **Speed of development:** the sooner you get your app in front of
    potential customers and test the market, the more quickly you can
    identify the features that people need and will pay for.
-   **Capacity for change:** create code that is easy to reuse and
    replace as you iteratively mould your product to fit the market. The
    report found that the apps that shifted their focus to better align
    with users (‘pivoted’ – [see chapter 21](33-chapter21.html)) one or
    two times experienced over three and a half times better user growth
    and went on to raise two and a half times more money from investors.

Before you start development
----------------------------

Your market research and user-tested prototype will form the backbone of
your development plan: the list of features that are essential to your
customers, how they function, and their user interface behaviour.

Even a minimal app can seem daunting when you first start, so begin by
breaking down the features and interface components into discrete tasks.
If you’re still clinging on to non-essential features, record these too
(so that you don’t forget them) but keep them separate or flag them as
lower priority.

![img-17\_1](img-17_1.jpg)

Keep track of individual development tasks with a lightweight project
management tool like the free Redmine^[3](#fn3)^

If you’re working in a team or with a customer, you need to ensure that
there is clarity and consensus on how different aspects of the app are
named – the domain language. Does the app record milestones, deadlines,
targets or due dates? If it creates a report, what does that mean,
exactly?

“There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation
and naming things.”\
 **Phil Karlton**^[4](#fn4)^

Create a shared list of definitions if you need to, but make sure that
everyone involved in the project uses the same words to refer to the
same concepts. You’ll need to name things in your database, in your
code, in the interface and in conversation with technical and
non-technical people, so avoid risky misunderstandings and clarify all
nomenclature upfront.

Use the platform you know
-------------------------

It’s tempting to learn the hottest new language that you keep reading
about, but to get something to test in front of customers as quickly as
possible, don’t get caught up in the hype. Use what you already know and
enjoy.

If you’re not developing the app in-house but are contracting out the
development, stick with proven technologies. The strength of online
community is a good signal that a technology is tried and tested. The
six most popular web languages – PHP, Java, C\#, Perl, Python and Ruby –
are all well represented with online discussions and documentation.

The availability of freelancers for a given technology has advantages
and drawbacks. As a rule of thumb, contractors of the most popular
languages (PHP and Java) are available for the lowest rates, but are
slightly less likely to have perfect rating from previous jobs.

![img-17\_2](img-17_2.jpg)

Elance^[5](#fn5)^ data shows that the technologies with fewer available
contractors tend to have a slightly higher percentage of 5\* ratings
among those contractors.

![img-17\_3](img-17_3.jpg)

Generally speaking, the more contractors that are available for a
language, the greater proportion who offer a low rate.

Borrow before you build
-----------------------

To develop an app quickly and easily, it makes sense to write as little
code as possible. After non-essential features have been cut or
postponed, the next best way of speeding up development is to take
advantage of appropriate code that others have written and shared, in
the form of libraries, frameworks and web services.

A library is essentially a collection of functions for a given topic.
These come in all shapes and sizes, from database connection management
and encryption, to image manipulation and Twitter integration. Your code
calls a library function, it performs the requested operation, and
returns the result and control back to your code. You can choose which
parts of a library to use and which parts to ignore; if you only use a
single feature of a larger library, that’s perfectly acceptable.

A framework defines a skeleton system, a predetermined flow of calls and
fundamental behaviours that you insert business logic into. Because of
this loss of control^[6](#fn6)^ over the architecture, it’s a larger
commitment to adopt a framework than a library, but you benefit from
tested design decisions and prebuilt workflows. If you’re contracting
out development, using a framework also gives you some instantly agreed
and documented conventions.

A web service (or web API) is the equivalent of a remote library, a set
of autonomous functions located on a third-party web server that can be
called independently. Web services are often made available instead of
libraries when the functionality requires a large repository of data
that would be impractical to ship with a library, or access to other
centralised resources or data. Examples of web services include the
OpenCalais API^[7](#fn7)^ that extracts names, facts and events from
unstructured text, and the Google Prediction API^[8](#fn8)^ that
provides machine learning capabilities.

Risk increases as you move from libraries to frameworks to web services.
Using a library has minimal risk, as you have a copy of the code on your
server and you rely on library functions only for discrete tasks. It is
usually straightforward to replace one library with another, partially
or fully. In contrast, for a framework, much of your code is written to
slot into a predefined architecture, which ties the development to the
choice of framework more tightly than for a library.

And though you only rely on web services for isolated tasks, the
complete lack of control makes them the riskiest form of code reuse: you
can’t control the response speed, service uptime, changes to
functionality or modifications to the terms of service.

Even so, an established framework will probably expedite the development
process and if a suitable web service is available, use it. At this
stage, speed and ease of development is vital. You can worry about
replacing web services with custom-built local code once the app has
successfully evolved to fit the market.

Borrow, maybe beg, but don’t steal. Always check the software licence
attached to any library or framework you use. Many will be available
under a permissive open source license (such as MIT^[9](#fn9)^ or
BSD^[10](#fn10)^) that doesn’t oblige you to take any special action,
but some (like the superb Ext JS^[11](#fn11)^) require the purchase of a
commercial licence for use in a commercial product.

Model-View-Controller
---------------------

Many web frameworks (including Rails^[12](#fn12)^, Django^[13](#fn13)^
and the Zend Framework^[14](#fn14)^) implement a model-view-controller
(MVC) architecture. This is designed to separate the presentation (user
interface) from the business logic, or domain model. The MVC pattern
supports our need to create reusable, easily modifiable code quickly:

-   Data can be displayed in multiple formats (such as a full HTML page,
    an RSS feed entry, and a partial stub of HTML for an Ajax call)
    without duplicating code.
-   Changes to the interface can be made easily, so that a rough
    prototype page can be evolved into a rich application screen without
    shifting awkwardly around embedded logic.
-   Development effort can be distributed among team members; the user
    interface and domain model can be separately assigned to those with
    the most suitable skills.

Most web frameworks organise MVC code into four component types: the
front controller, controllers, views and models.

![img-17\_4](img-17_4.jpg)

Structure of MVC components in a web app

The front controller is an addition to the classic three-piece MVC
pattern. It centralises and handles common issues associated with a web
request, such as caching, session management and basic security checks.
The front controller also analyses the incoming HTTP message (typically
generated by the user clicking an element in the app interface) and
delegates the request to a relevant controller.

The role of the controller is to respond appropriately to the specific
request. However, the controller should not contain complex logic, but
instead use a relevant model or view, or both, to fulfil the request.

A model encapsulates domain logic and data, and often represents a
specific entity in the system, such as a document, user or recipe. The
model is designed to be completely ignorant of how it is displayed, but
instead exposes methods to manipulate and access the model data. A
controller uses the model methods to fulfil the request, which may be to
select a specific item or update a value.

Where it is the role of the controller to handle the input, the view
manages the output. Once the controller has performed the appropriate
action on the model, a view renders the output. If it needs to, it can
access the data in the model or other values that have been prepared by
the controller.

For example, when a user submits a new recipe in a culinary app, the
front controller first inspects the incoming recipe data for security
risks and prepares the user session. It routes the request to the
`RecipeController` controller, which in turn passes the incoming form
data to the `createNewRecipe()` action inside the `RecipeModel` model.
Finally, the `RecipeCreatedView` view is called, which accesses the
newly created data in the model to display a summary of the recipe under
a boilerplate confirmation message.

For maximum code reuse and testability, all domain logic should be
located inside models, and controllers should be as thin as possible, in
general no more than a few lines of code that call the necessary models
or views.

Design for reuse and replacement
--------------------------------

The MVC architecture is a good example of the benefits of thoughtfully
organised code. By separating presentation from logic and modularising
both, we’re able to quickly and easily change independent parts of the
app as the market shapes it towards profitability. Similar principles
should be used throughout your code.

Keep related things together in the same class, function, or whatever is
suitable for your language of choice. Ideally, every unit of code will
serve a single purpose, which means that they should be relatively
small.

If several units of code contain similar behaviours, the similarities
should be abstracted out into a separate generic unit that the others
can use. These generic, reusable units should hide as much of their
internal complexity as possible and instead expose relatively few
straightforward methods^[15](#fn15)^ to limit their abuse.

To make code that is highly reusable and replaceable, it should be
loosely coupled. Each unit should be independent and should function
with little knowledge of other units. As the Law of Demeter^[16](#fn16)^
puts it, ‘a component should only talk to its immediate friends’. Use
techniques like dependency injection^[17](#fn17)^ and the observer
pattern^[18](#fn18)^ to reduce coupling in your code.

Front-end libraries and frameworks
----------------------------------

Much like server-side code can make use of prebuilt libraries and
frameworks to speed up development, so can front-end HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.

The HTML5 Boilerplate^[19](#fn19)^ is a useful starting point for app
markup. In the spirit of a library, you can choose to cut or keep as
much of the skeleton code as you need, from cross-browser and mobile
device support, to the accompanying web server configuration (.htaccess)
and search engine (robots.txt) files.

![img-17\_5](img-17_5.jpg)

Part of the HTML5 Boilerplate

Most CSS and JavaScript frameworks provide two crucial benefits to
development speed. They are designed to neutralise cross-browser
discrepancies, and to reduce the amount of code needed by providing
shortcuts to complicated features and commonly used techniques.

A reset style sheet is the most basic type of CSS library. It defines a
set of rules to remove inconsistent browser default styles, such as the
margin around a form. A reset style sheet is purposely liberal to ensure
the highest level of consistency, and it can even remove some default
styles that are useful, like italic `<em>` text or headings that are
larger than paragraph text. As Eric Meyer says for his Reset
CSS^[20](#fn20)^ style sheet, “The reset styles given here are
intentionally very generic. […] It should be tweaked, edited, extended,
and otherwise tuned to match your specific reset baseline.”

The Yahoo! Base CSS^[21](#fn21)^ file is an extension to their reset
file^[22](#fn22)^ that applies a consistent baseline style to common
HTML elements. This approach of removing variations and applying a
baseline is combined in the normalize.css^[23](#fn23)^ file, which not
only sets a consistent default style but also fixes a number of browser
rendering bugs.

After browser variations have been neutralised, CSS grid frameworks can
help to arrange app interfaces that are designed with a grid layout. The
960 Grid System^[24](#fn24)^ defines a 960 pixels-wide grid with 12 or
16 columns; the 1Kb CSS Grid^[25](#fn25)^ and Yahoo! Grids
CSS^[26](#fn26)^ are more configurable in width and number of columns.
Blueprint^[27](#fn27)^ goes one step further and combines a grid, reset
style sheet and baseline style into a single CSS framework.

Instead of prebuilt classes and styles, extensions to CSS add new
features to the core language to make CSS development faster and easier
to change. LESS^[28](#fn28)^ and Sass^[29](#fn29)^ offer comparable
support for CSS variables, functions and nested rules, with minor
differences in syntax. Both systems include server-side compilers to
convert their bespoke CSS language into standard CSS files, and both
offer a ‘watch’ feature that automatically recreates a standard CSS file
whenever a change to the custom LESS or Sass file is detected.

  LESS                                                                                                                                        Sass
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `@main-color: #333333;`                                                                                                                     `$main-color: #333333;`
  `                 .photoframe(@width: 5px) {                 border: @width solid #eee;                 }                 `                 `                 @mixin photoframe($width: 5px) {                 border: $width solid #eee;                 }                 `
  `                 .large-photo {                 color: @main-color;                 .bordered(10px);                 }                 `   `                 .large-photo {                 color: $main-color;                 @include bordered(10px);                 }                 `

Minor differences in syntax between LESS and Sass

Compass^[30](#fn30)^ combines the reset, baseline and grid styles of
Blueprint with the features of Sass. There’s also an accompanying
cross-platform Compass app^[31](#fn31)^ to help you set up new projects
and automatically compile CSS.

When it comes to JavaScript libraries, jQuery^[32](#fn32)^ reigns
supreme. As of September 2011, jQuery is used on half of the 10,000 most
popular websites, and is steadily growing^[33](#fn33)^. The
cross-browser library makes it easy to select and modify DOM elements,
manipulate style, respond to events and make Ajax calls. It is also
designed to support plug-ins, of which there are thousands^[34](#fn34)^,
ranging from form validation to multimedia players.

Other comparable JavaScript libraries tend to focus more on providing
advanced object oriented features, so jQuery’s straightforward DOM and
style manipulation make it particularly suited to rapid app interface
development. The jQuery UI library extends jQuery to introduce practical
interactions (drag-and-drop, resize, sort), effects (fade, hide, slide)
and widgets (calendar, progress bar, tabs). The library is one of the
simplest tools that you can exploit to quickly build a rich web app
interface, with the bonus that jQuery UI widgets can be easily styled
with themes to match your design.

jQuery UI provides numerous ready-built widgets and themes

Summary
-------

Many developers have a deep-rooted need to solve problems elegantly and
they invest time in the minutiae of artful custom code. While this can
be a desirable trait for the stability and longevity of established
products, the unpredictability of early-stage apps demands a less
fastidious mindset.

-   Create code in the easiest, fastest way possible.
-   Consider that all code might change or be thrown away.
-   Stick to core technologies that you already know.
-   Break down the app features into individual tasks.
-   Agree on nomenclature.
-   Use libraries, frameworks and web services to speed up early
    development and neutralise browser inconsistencies.
-   Check the licence of any third-party code that you use.
-   The MVC architecture is suitable for many web apps.
-   Where possible, create code that is modularised, abstracted and
    loosely coupled.
