### Programs

A quick way of backing up a list of programs is to run this:

    dpkg --get-selections > ~/Package.list
    sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list ~/sources.list
    sudo apt-key exportall > ~/Repo.keys

It will back them up in a format that dpkg can read for after your
reinstall, like this:

    sudo apt-key add ~/Repo.keys
    sudo cp ~/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list 
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install dselect
    sudo dpkg --set-selections < ~/Package.list
    sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade -y

### Settings and Personal Data

Before you reinstall, you should probably back up the settings from some
of your programs, this can easily be done by grabbing folders from /etc
and all the content from your user directory (not just the stuff you can
see in nautilus!):

    rsync --progress /home/`whoami` /path/to/user/profile/backup/here

After you reinstall, you can restore it with:

    rsync --progress /path/to/user/profile/backup/here /home/`whoami`

### So all together as a pseudo-bash script.

This assumes there is only one user on the machine (remove `/'whoami'`
otherwise) and that you used the same username on both installs (modify
dest. of rsync otherwise).

    dpkg --get-selections > ~/Package.list
    sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list ~/sources.list
    sudo apt-key exportall > ~/Repo.keys
    rsync --progress /home/`whoami` /path/to/user/profile/backup/here

    ##  Reinstall now

    rsync --progress /path/to/user/profile/backup/here /home/`whoami`
    sudo apt-key add ~/Repo.keys
    sudo cp ~/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list 
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install dselect
    sudo dpkg --set-selections < ~/Package.list
    sudo dselect

The only thing missing here is to remember to back up the sources.list!
I can say from personal experience the restore will fail without this.
For a complete backup, make sure deja vu is backing up your home folder
and files along with your sources.list and a list of installed packages.
I used to have a seperate cron that ran to back this up into a file on
my home directory, along with a simple script that would restore
everything using the sources.list backup and the package.list file.
Reinstalling requires you to restore your home folder, then execute the
script to restore everything. –

**Who is this for:** users that have normal regular use of their
computer, that have done minimal or no configuration outside their home
folder, did not mess up startup scripts and services. A user that wants
to have his software restored to how it was when he installed it with
all customizations being done and kept in their home folder.

**Who this will not fit for:** servers geeks, power users with software
installed by source (restoring the package list might break your
system), users that have changed the startup script of some application
to fit better their needs. Caution: there is a big chance any
modifications outside home will be over written.

### Backup your current packages and user settings

* * * * *

Once you are ready with your system and happy with the software
installed you can get a list of the installed packages using the command
`dpkg --get-selections` and save the output in to a log file.

Create a `backup` folder in your home

    sudo mkdir ~/backup

Save the currently installed packages list

    dpkg --get-selections > ~/backup/installed_packages.log

Make a backup of your apt sources file

    sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list ~/backup/sources.bak

and a copy of your apt's list of trusted keys

    sudo apt-key exportall > ~/backup/repositories.keys

Make a backup of your home folder with the integrated backup tool in
Ubuntu, Deja-dup.

-   Set the backup folder

![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sFKv7.png)

-   Verify that it will make a backup of your home folder and add any
    folders your might not want, like for instance the `Trash` folder

![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9n8ld.png)

-   On the overview tab press *Make Backup Now* to backup your home
    folder

![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3PGiT.png)

-   The backup tool will ask if you want to add a password to your
    backup, your choice. Your backup will start after you press
    *Continue*

![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/R62qG.png)

When this is done you will have a backup of your packages and
configuration files relative to your user. If when necessary you will be
able to restore your files from the `~/backup` folder. \
\

### Restoring your backup

* * * * *

Start by restoring the sources file from the backup made

    sudo cp ~/backup/sources.bak /etc/apt/sources.list

The backed-up keys

    sudo apt-key add ~/backup/repositories.keys

Update your sources lists

    sudo apt-get update

Restore the packages from the saved `installed_packages.log`

    sudo dpkg --clear-selections
    sudo dpkg --set-selections < ~/backup/installed_packages.log && sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade

`sudo dpkg --clear-selections` will mark all current packages installed
for removal, that way when you restore your saved package list the
packages that are not on the list will be removed from your system.

Remove your current configuration from your home creating a backup of
the folder in their current state (after all, whats the use of restoring
fresh files if there are other there that can affect the configuration?)

    mkdir ~/.old-gnome-config/ && mv ~/.gnome* ~/.old-gnome-config/ && mv ~/.gconf* ~/.old-gnome-config/ && mv ~/.metacity ~/.old-gnome-config/ && mv ~/.cache ~/.old-gnome-config/ && mv ~/.dbus ~/.old-gnome-config/ && mv ~/.dmrc ~/.old-gnome-config/ && mv ~/.mission-control ~/.old-gnome-config/ && mv ~/.thumbnails ~/.old-gnome-config/   && ~/.config/dconf/* ~/.old-gnome-config/

After this is done restore the backup created with Deja-dup.

-   Open the backup tool and on the overview tab press restore

![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/G0KFJ.png)

-   Follow the prompts to restore the files to their original positions

![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IMf0v.png)

After this is done you will have your packages back to the saved
selection, our configuration restored and hopefully a working desktop,
all of that without installing a single extra application and using the
Ubuntu default tools.

The only thing left is to do some clean up and check that everything is
working. \
\

### Something went wrong, my desktop is gone

* * * * *

There are a few posts in Ask Ubuntu that can guide you in case something
when wrong and you need to hard reset your desktop. If something when
wrong and you find your self needing to do so, please have a look at
these posts:

Backups take some planning and there are several viable strategies. You
will have to decide which method works best for you.

Be careful about "best way" , what works best for one person may not be
best for another.

**At the end of the day, the "best method" is one that has been tested
and known to work. You need to test your backup strategy BEFORE you need
it**

Using images
------------

One way is to simply copy and compress an image of your partitions. You
can do this with several tools, anything from dd to partimage to
clonezilla

[partimage](http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/partimage)\
 [clonezilla](http://www.clonezilla.org/)

The advantage of this strategy is that it is (relatively) easy and very
complete. The disadvantage is that the back up images are large.

Smaller backups
---------------

You can make smaller backups by only backing up data and settings. There
are several tools to do this, everything from dd to tar to rsync.

**The key here is to know what you need to back up.**

Advantage - Backups will be smaller.\
 Disadvantage - This is a manual method, so it is easy to forget about a
critical file (/etc/passwd).

A list of what to back will always need to be reviewed to make sure the
list is complete.

\1) List of **installed packages**

Package list \# Create a text list of an existing installation of all
apt-get installed packages \# in order to re-install on a newly
installed distro

    # make the list
    [old distro] sudo dpkg --get-selections > packages

You would then perform a fresh install, and restore your packages. The
following commands also update all the packages on your system (so
restore and full update all at once).

    # Now put them back on the new distro
    [new distro] sudo dpkg --set-selections < packages

    [new distro] sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade

\2) **Data**. Generally this would be /home . Most user data and
customization's are going to be in your users home directory. If you
save data in other locations, include that (for example /media/data).

\3) **system settings** . Here is where there is going to be some
variation. Personally if I edit **ANY** system setting, I keep a copy of
the original configuration file and my custom file in /root. So if I
edit `/etc/fstab` for example, keep a copy in /root/etc/fstab and
original in /root/etc/fstab.orig

You will also need `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow` , `/etc/group` ,
`/etc/sudoers`, `/etc/hostname`, and `/etc/hosts` (you may need more in
/etc, if I forgot something I will add it)

On a server you may need to include `/var/www` or other data
directories.

I understand this takes some effort, so, **it may be easier to include
all of `/etc`**.

\4) A copy of your disk **partition table**.

    sudo fdisk -l > fdisk.bak

You can use this information to restore your partition table if you
replace your hard drive.

\5) A copy of your **MBR**

    dd if=/dev/sda of=MBR.bak bs=512 count=1

You would then restore with

    dd if=MBR.bak of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1

\6) **Other files/directories** - Depending on your system and
customization you may need to include additional directories.
Considerations might include `/opt` , `/usr/local`, /usr/share\`, and/or
your .desktop files. Anything on your system you downloaded or
customized outside of apt-get or software manager.

\7) Put all that into an **archive**

    tar -cvpzf backup.tar.gz /home /root /etc ./MBR.bak ./fsdisk.bak ./packages

\8) **rsync**

As an alternate to tar, you can use rsync.

See -
[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/rsync](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/rsync)

Network backups
---------------

Another option is to use NFS or Samba to back up data.

Cron
----

You can automate backups by writing a backup script and running it
(daily / hourly) with cron.

Restore
-------

\1) Using a live CD, restore your partitions using gparted or fdisk from
the information in fdisk.bak\
 2) Install Ubuntu.\
 3) Boot your new install, update your packages.\
 4) Restore your data and settings

    tar -xvpzf /home/test/backup.tar.gz -C / 

Then reboot

See also -
[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem/TAR](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem/TAR)

Other Strategies
----------------

There are many additional strategies for backup, some for backing up
your home directory only, some graphical.

see:
[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem)

Testing
-------

It is not a backup unless it is tested. This is most important when you
are NOT using an image of your root partition.

Test restoring your system in a VM, a spare computer, or a spare
partition or hard drive.

To create a backup list of all your installed programs:
[http://savvyadmin.com/backup-and-restore-package-lists-in-ubuntu/](http://savvyadmin.com/backup-and-restore-package-lists-in-ubuntu/)\
 You will obviously need to backup your software sources that some of
those installed packages are from:
[http://askubuntu.com/questions/2038/backup-software-sources/2042\#2042](http://askubuntu.com/questions/2038/backup-software-sources/2042#2042)

As for your program settings, most of those are in hidden (start with a
`.`) folders and files in your home folder. I would just backup all of
them.

Although this question has been answered for a while, I noticed that
nobody mentioned etckeeper. Run `apt-get install etckeeper`, configure
your VCS in `/etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf`, and you will from then on
have much better control of your /etc directory. This can **also** be
used to restore your configurations within the /etc directory.

For instance, (assuming you configured git as your VCS) back up your
`/etc/.git` directory. Any time you need to restore your configurations
onto a fresh /etc, you copy your backed-up /etc/.git directory into the
fresh /etc directory. You now have many options for managing your
restoration:

-   View differences
    -   `git diff`

-   Keep all differences in the "fresh" directory in a git branch
    -   `git checkout -b new; git add -A; git commit -m 'new etc'`

-   Unconditionally revert to your backup
    -   `git clean -f`

> I want to have ready-to-restore apps and their data, also offline.

That defeats the purpose of a "format-and-install". If you want to do
that, just do an upgrade from your existing Ubuntu installation.

Since "installation" in Ubuntu is as simply as going into the Software
Center (or Synaptic or `apt-get`), and most programs are themselves
updated frequently, there's no real point in backing up the programs,
reinstalling Ubuntu and then installing from the backups instead of just
getting the latest versions from the repositories.

As long as your data and program settings are backed up, you should be
fine. If you still want a comprehensive list of everything in your
system so you know if a package is missing, just go into the terminal
and type `dpkg --list > mypackages.txt`, and put that text file
somewhere safe -- it contains *every* package ever installed on your
current system.

I'll assume its a new HDD, SSD or new system or you had on an old
Ubuntu. Now you want to upgrade to 12.04?

I'll assume you detest installing them all again or reconfiguring? No
need to.

Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T, and run the following command:

    sudo dpkg --get-selections > app-backup-list.txt

Then cp the text file to your home directory by:

    sudo cp app-backup-list.txt /home/username

Next run backup application from the systems settings in side bar.

Backup `/home` to Ubuntu One, a flash stick, a floppy (oops scratch
that) or burn onto a CD, or other HDD in system or external HDD drive or
use whatever backup program you want.

Then reversed the backup using restore, pick in the backup program you
used, and now \\home is back.

Lastly, reverse the `dkpg` command:

    sudo dpkg --get-selections < app-backup-list.txt
    sudo apt-get -y update
    sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade

**Note**:

Restoring home, gets all settings for your applications. I installed a
SSD ,and copied all the files, but still did a backup just in case.

**PS**: this avoids, actually backing up, massive apps machine code,
etc. Make sure your download folder is clean. Not full of machine code
or videos then burn the `download` folder to DVD using k3B.

HERE](http://utherpendragonfly.wordpress.com/2011/07/20/reinstalling-applications-in-linux-with-synaptic-package-manager/)

I will copy what the website says for backing up the programs:

"*Along with backing up my /home partition, I also use Synaptic Package
Manager to periodically make a backup list of all my installed packages
(applications and their dependencies). To do this you need to be using
an Ubuntu-based distro or one that uses Synaptic. I’m not familiar with
doing this in other distros that use a different package manager. But in
Bodhi Linux, Linux Mint, or any other Ubuntu/Debian derivative, just
open Synaptic; go to File\> Save Markings. Make sure to check the little
box that says ‘Save full state, not only changes’ and then save that
file to wherever you want (preferably wherever you saved your /home
backup). Then when you need to reinstall an operating system, after
applying all updates, you can open Synaptic, go to File\> Read Markings
and choose your saved Packages file. As long as you’re connected to the
internet it will automatically download and install all the applications
and other packages that you had originally installed. This certainly
saves a lot of time and trouble so you don’t have to search for and
reinstall all your application*"

cheers

To backup all your installed package, with a GUI, you can use the Ubuntu
Software Center, Go in Menu (then log-in) and Sync all your package.
When you will need to re-install, select all package from a machine and
click 'install' from the same menu.

From the command line (CLI) you can also use OneConf (oneconf).

I didn't check for a year, maybe this have now more option like some
settings instead of only package listing backup.
