I believe the day-to-day practice of writing JavaScript is going to
change dramatically for the better when ECMAScript.next arrives. The
coming year is going to be an exciting time for developers as features
proposed or finalised for the next versions of the language start to
become more widely available.

In this post, I will review some of the features I'm personally looking
forward to landing and being used in 2013 and beyond.

ES.next implementation status
-----------------------------

Be sure to look at Juriy Zaytsev's [ECMAScript 6 compatibility
table](http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/es6/), Mozilla's ES6
[status](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/ECMAScript_6_support_in_Mozilla)
page as well as the bleeding edge versions of modern browsers (e.g
[Chrome Canary](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs), [Firefox
Aurora](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/aurora/)) to find out what
ES.next features are available to play with right now.

In Canary, remember that to enable all of the latest JavaScript
experiments you should navigate to `chrome:flags` and use the 'Enable
Experimental JavaScript' option.

Alternatively, many ES.next features can be experimented with using
Google's [Traceur](https://code.google.com/p/traceur-compiler/)
transpiler (useful unit tests with examples
[here](http://code.google.com/p/traceur-compiler/source/browse/#git%2Ftest%2Ffeature))
and there are shims available for other features via projects such as
[ES6-Shim](https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim) and [Harmony
Collections](https://github.com/Benvie/harmony-collections).

Finally, in Node.js (V8), the `--harmony` flag activates a number of
experimental ES.next features including block scoping, WeakMaps and
more.

Modules
-------

We're used to separating our code into manageable blocks of
functionality. In ES.next, A module is a unit of code contained within a
`module` declaration. It can either be defined inline or within an
externally loaded module file. A skeleton inline module for a Car could
be written:

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
module Car {
  // import …
  // export …
}
~~~~

A module *instance* is a module which has been evaluated, is linked to
other modules or has lexically encapsulated data. An example of a module
instance is:

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
module myCar at "car.js";
~~~~

`module` declarations can be used in the following contexts:

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
module UniverseTest {};
module Universe { module MilkyWay {} };
module MilkyWay = 'Universe/MilkyWay';
module SolarSystem = Universe.MilkyWay.SolarSystem;
module MySystem = SolarSystem;
~~~~

An `export` declaration declares that a local function or variable
binding is visible externally to other modules. If familiar with the
module pattern, think of this concept as being parallel to the idea of
exposing functionality publicly.

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
module Car {
  // Internal
  var licensePlateNo = '556-343';
  // External
  export function drive(speed, direction) {
    console.log('details:', speed, direction);
  }
  export module engine{
    export function check() { }
  }
  export var miles = 5000;
  export var color = 'silver';
};
~~~~

Modules `import` what they wish to use from other modules. Other modules
may read the module exports (e.g `drive()`, `miles` etc. above) but they
cannot modify them. Exports can be renamed as well so their names are
different from local names.

Revisiting the export example above, we can now selectively choose what
we wish to `import` when in another module.

We can just import `drive()`:

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
import drive from Car;
~~~~

We can import `drive()` and `miles`:

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
import {drive, miles} from Car;
~~~~

Earlier, we mentioned the concept of a Module Loader API. The module
loader allows us to dynamically load in scripts for consumption. Similar
to `import`, we are able to consume anything defined as an `export` from
such modules.

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
// Signature: load(moduleURL, callback, errorCallback)
Loader.load('car.js', function(car) {
  console.log(car.drive(500, 'north'));
}, function(err) {
  console.log('Error:' + err);
});
~~~~

`load()` accepts three arguments:

-   `moduleURL`: The string representing a module URL (e.g "car.js")
-   `callback`: A callback function which receives the output result of
    attempting to load, compile and then execute the module
-   `errorCallback`: A callback triggered if an error occurs during
    loading or compilation

Whilst the above example seems fairly trivial to use, the Loader API is
there to provide a way to load modules in controlled contexts and
actually supports a number of different configuration options. `Loader`
itself is a system provided instance of the API, but it's possible to
create custom loaders using the `Loader` constructor.

#### What about classes?

I'm not going to be covering ES.next
[classes](http://infrequently.org/2012/04/class-warfare/) in this post
in more, but for those wondering how they relate to modules, Alex
Russell has previously shared a pretty
[readable](http://infrequently.org/2011/09/why-class-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-means/)
example of how the two fit in – it's not at all about turning JavaScript
into Java.

Classes in ES.next are there to provide a declarative surface for the
semantics we're used to (e.g functions, prototypes) so that developer
intent is expressed instead of the underlying imperative mechanics.

Here's some ES.next code for defining a widget:

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
module widgets {
  // ...
  class DropDownButton extends Widget {
    constructor(attributes) {
      super(attributes);
      this.buildUI();
    }
    buildUI() {
      this.domNode.onclick = function(){
        // ...
      };
    }
  }
}
~~~~

Followed by today's de-sugared approach that ignores the semantic
improvements brought by ES.next modules over the module pattern and
instead emphasises our reliance of function variants:

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
var widgets = (function(global) {
  // ...
  function DropDownButton(attributes) {
    Widget.call(this, attributes);
    this.buildUI();
  }
  DropDownButton.prototype = Object.create(Widget.prototype, {
    constructor: { value: DropDownButton },
    buildUI:     {
      value: function(e) {
        this.domNode.onclick = function(e) {
          // ...
        }
      }
    }
  });
})(this);
~~~~

All the ES.next version does it makes the code more easy to read. What
`class` means here is `function`, or at least, one of the things we
currently do with functions. If you enjoy JavaScript and like using
functions and prototypes, such sugar is nothing to fear in the next
version of JavaScript.

#### Where do these modules fit in with AMD?

If anything, the landscape for modularization and loading of code on the
front-end has seen a wealth of hacks, abuse and experimentation, but
we've been able to get by so far.

Are ES.next modules a step in the right direction? Perhaps. My own take
on them is that reading their specs is one thing and actually using them
is another. Playing with the newer module syntax in
[Harmonizr](https://github.com/jdiamond/harmonizr), [Require
HM](https://github.com/jrburke/require-hm) and
[Traceur](traceur-compiler.googlecode.com), you actually get used to the
syntax and semantics very quickly – it feels like using a cleaner module
pattern but with access to native loader API for any dynamic module
loading required at runtime. That said, the syntax might feel a little
too much like Python for some peoples tastes (e.g the `import`
statements).

I'm part of the camp that believe if there's functionality developers
are using broadly enough (e.g better modules), the platform (i.e the
browser) should be trying to offer some of this natively and I'm not
alone in feeling this way. James Burke, who was instrumental in bringing
us AMD and RequireJS has previously said:

> I want AMD and RequireJS to go away. They solve a real problem, but
> ideally the language and runtime should have similar capabilities
> built in. Native support should be able to cover the 80% case of
> RequireJS usage, to the point that no userland "module loader" library
> should be needed for those use cases, at least in the browser.

James has however questioned whether ES.next modules are a sufficient
solution. He covered some more of his thoughts on ES.next modules back
in June in [ES6 Modules: Suggestions for
improvement](http://tagneto.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/es-modules-suggestions-for-improvement.html)
and later in [Why not
AMD?](http://tagneto.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/why-not-amd.html) for anyone
interested in reading more about how these modules fit in with RequireJS
and AMD.

Isaac Schlueter has also previously written up thoughts on where ES6
modules [fall
short](http://blog.izs.me/post/25906678790/on-es-6-modules) that are
worth noting. Try them out yourself using some of the options below and
see what you think.

Object.observe()
----------------

The idea behind `Object.observe` is that we gain the ability to observe
and notify applications of changes made to specific JavaScript objects.
Such changes include properties being added, updated, removed or
reconfigured.

Property observing is behaviour we commonly find in JavaScript MVC
frameworks at at the moment and is an important component of
data-binding, found in solutions like AngularJS and Ember.

This is a fundamentally important addition to JS as it could both offer
performance improvements over a framework's custom implementations and
allow easier observation of plain native objects.

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
// A model can be a simple object
var todoModel = {
    label: 'Default',
    completed: false
};
// Which we then observe
Object.observe(todoModel, function(changes) {
    changes.forEach(function(change, i) {
        console.log(change);
        /*
            What property changed? change.name
            How did it change? change.type
            Whats the current value? change.object[change.name]
        */
    });
});
// Examples
todoModel.label = 'Buy some more milk';
/*
    label changed
    It was changed by being updated
    Its current value is 'Buy some more milk'
*/
todoModel.completeBy = '01/01/2013';
/*
    completeBy changed
    It was changed by being new
    Its current value is '01/01/2013'
*/
delete todoModel.completed;
/*
    completed changed
    It was changed by being deleted
    Its current value is undefined
*/
~~~~

Availability: Object.observe will be available in Chrome Canary behind
the "Enable Experimental JS APIs" flag. If you don't feel like getting
that setup, you can also checkout this video by Rafael Weinstein
[discussing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO--VXFJnmE) the proposal.

### Use it today

-   [Special build of Chromium](http://github.com/rafaelw/v8)
-   [Watch.JS](https://github.com/melanke/Watch.JS) appears to offer
    similar behaviour, but isn't a polyfill or shim for `Object.observe`
    outright

Default Parameter Values
------------------------

Default parameter values allow us to initialize parameters if they are
not explicitly supplied. This means that we no longer have to write
`options = options || {};`.

The syntax is modified by allowing an (optional) initialiser after the
parameter names:

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
function addTodo(caption = 'Do something') {
    console.log(caption);
}
addTodo(); // Do something
~~~~

Only trailing parameters may have default values:

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
function addTodo(caption, order = 4) {}
function addTodo(caption = 'Do something', order = 4) {}
function addTodo(caption, order = 10, other = this) {}
~~~~

Block Scoping
-------------

Block scoping introduces new declaration forms for defining variables
scoped to a single block. This includes:

-   `let`: which syntactically is quite similar to `var`, but defines a
    variable in the current block function, allowing function
    declarations in nested blocks
-   `const`: like `let`, but is for read-only constant declarations

Using `let` in place of `var` makes it easier to define block-local
variables without worrying about them clashing with variables elsewhere
in the same function body. The scope of a variable that's been declared
inside a `let` statement using `var` is the same as if it had been
declared outside the `let` statement. These types of variables will
still have function scoping.

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
var x = 8;
var y = 0;
let (x = x+10, y = 12) {
  console.log(x+y); // 30
}
console.log(x + y); // 8
~~~~

`let` availability: FF18, Chrome 24+

`const` availability: FF18, Chrome 24+, SF6, WebKit, Opera 12

Maps and sets
-------------

### Maps

Many of you will already be familiar with the concept of maps as we've
been using plain JavaScript objects as them for quite some time. Maps
allow us to map a value to a unique key such that we can retrieve the
value using the key without the pains of prototype-based inheritance.

With the Maps `set()` method, new name-value pairs are stored in the map
and using `get()`, the values can be retrieved. Maps also have the
following three methods:

-   `has(key)` : a boolean check to test if a key exists
-   `delete(key)` : deletes the key specified from the map
-   `size()` : returns the number of stored name-value pairs

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
let m = new Map();
m.set('todo', 'todo'.length);  // "something" → 4
m.get('todo');                 // 4
m.has('todo');                 // true
m.delete('todo');              // true
m.has('todo');                 // false
~~~~

### Sets

As Nicholas has pointed out before, sets won't be new to developers
coming from Ruby or Python, but it's a feature thats been missing from
JavaScript. Data of any type can be stored in a set, although values can
be set only once. They are an effective means of creating ordered list
of values that cannot contain duplicates.

-   `add(value)` – adds the value to the set.
-   `delete(value)` – sets the value for the key in the set.
-   `has(value)` – returns a boolean asserting whether the value has
    been added to the set

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
let s = new Set([1, 2, 3]);  // s has 1, 2 and 3.
s.has(-Infinity);            // false
s.add(-Infinity);            // s has 1, 2, 3, and -Infinity.
s.has(-Infinity);            // true
s.delete(-Infinity);         // true
s.has(-Infinity);            // false
~~~~

One possible use for sets is reducing the complexity of filtering
operations. e.g:

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
function unique(array) {
    var seen = new Set;
    return array.filter(function (item) {
        if (!seen.has(item)) {
            seen.add(item);
            return true;
        }
    });
}
~~~~

This results in O(n) for filtering uniques in an array. Almost all
methods of array unique with objects are O(n\^2) (credit goes to Brandon
Benvie for this suggestion).

Proxies
-------

The Proxy API will allow us to create objects whose properties may be
computed at run-time dynamically. It will also support hooking into
other objects for tasks such as logging or auditing.

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
var obj = {foo: "bar"};
var proxyObj = Proxy.create({
  get: function(obj, propertyName) {
    return 'Hey, '+ propertyName;
  }
});
console.log(proxyObj.Alex); // "Hey, Alex"
~~~~

Zakas)](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2011/09/15/experimenting-with-ecmascript-6-proxies/)

WeakMaps
--------

WeakMaps help developers avoid memory leaks by holding references to
their properties weakly, meaning that if a WeakMap is the only object
with a reference to another object, the garbage collector may collect
the referenced object. This behavior differs from all variable
references in ES5.

A key property of Weak Maps is the inability to enumerate their keys.

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
let m = new WeakMap();
m.set('todo', 'todo'.length);  // Exception!
// TypeError: Invalid value used as weak map key
m.has('todo');                 // Exception!
// TypeError: Invalid value used as weak map key
let wmk = {};
m.set(wmk, 'thinger');  // wmk → 'thinger'
m.get(wmk);             // 'thinger'
m.has(wmk);             // true
m.delete(wmk);          // true
m.has(wmk);             // false
~~~~

So again, the main difference between WeakMaps and Maps is that WeakMaps
are not enumerable.

API improvements
----------------

### Object.is

Introduces a function for comparison called `Object.is`. The main
difference between `===` and `Object.is` are the way `NaN`s and
(negative) zeroes are treated. A `NaN` is equal to another `NaN` and
negative zeroes are not equal from other positive zeroes.

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
Object.is(0, -0); // false
Object.is(NaN, NaN); // true
0 === -0; // true
NaN === NaN; // false
~~~~

#### Use it today

-   [ES6 Shim](https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim)

### Array.from

`Array.from`: Converts a single argument that is an array-like object or
list (eg. arguments, NodeList, DOMTokenList (used by classList),
NamedNodeMap (used by attributes property)) into a `new Array()` and
returns it;

Converting any Array-Like objects:

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
Array.from({
    0: 'Buy some milk',
    1: 'Go running',
    2: 'Pick up birthday gifts',
    length: 3
});
~~~~

The following examples illustrate common DOM use cases:

~~~~ {.javascript name="code"}
var divs = document.querySelectorAll('div');
Array.from(divs);
// [<div class=​"some classes" data-info=​"12">​</div>​, <div data-info=​"10">​</div>​]
Array.from(divs).forEach(function(node) {
    console.log(node);
});
~~~~

Conclusions
-----------

ES.next is shaping up to potentially include solutions for what many of
us consider are missing from JavaScript at the moment. Whilst ES6 is
targeting a 2013 spec release, browsers are already implementing
individual features and it's only a matter of time before their
availability is widespread.

In the meantime, we can use (some) modern browsers, transpilers, shims
and in some cases custom builds to experiment with features before ES6
is fully here.

For more examples and up to date information, feel free to checkout the
[TC39 Codex Wiki](https://github.com/dherman/tc39-codex-wiki/) (which
was a great reference when putting together this post) maintained by
Dave Herman and others. It contains summaries of all features currently
being targeted for the next version of JavaScript.

Exciting times are most definitely ahead.

        I know there’s a lot coming, but it’s thankfully not too scary
        ![:)](http://addyosmani.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
        Many of these changes will take time to be both finalized and
        implemented across all modern browsers so we’ll have a decent
        period in between to get used to the new syntax and semantics.

    Many of these shiny new features are available today via
    CoffeeScript + Static Compilation + Closure Library. For example:
    github.com/Steida/este\
     Of course native support is much better, but we don’t have to wait
    for awesomeness.

    Very nice review of ES.next features, Addy.\
     I look forward to use most of these features, however I see an
    increasing layer of complexity being added to JS. Making for a steep
    learning curve for beginners.\
     Criticisms aside, I’m really excited for obj.observe and modules =)

        I understand the worry. However, especially block scoping,
        classes and modules will \*reduce\* the learning curve.

    Can you explain what the point of Map and Set are as in what was
    wrong with plain-old js object?

    One of things I dislike about python is the difference between on
    object and a dict. One of the things I love about JavaScript is
    there is only one kind and the syntax is always correct.

    In python, sometimes it’s v.key, sometimes it’s v["key"]. In JS both
    are the same. In python sometimes it’s if key in dict. Otherwise
    it’s if hasattr(key). In JS it’s always simple.

    Serializing is simple. Inspecting and debugging is simple.

    python pseudo code

    def dump(o):\
     if o is obj\
     iterater through attributes\
     if o is dict\
     iterator through keys

    js pseudo code

    function dump(o) {\
     iterate through keys

    Adding map and set will make life more complicated

        Objects-as-maps have a few pitfalls (overriding methods,
        \_\_proto\_\_). Furthermore, you can only use strings as keys.
        With maps, you can use any kind of value.

        I think you are right here.\
         I’m trying to learn Python and I ran today into a problem where
        I needed to create some custom dictionaries (
        dictionary[key1][key2] ). With JavaScript, it would have been
        very easy but with Python… let’s just I’m grateful StackOverflow
        exists.

    I’ve written an ES6 virtual machine that runs in ES3 (IE8+). It has
    nearly everything that’s going to be in ES6 including modules and
    the loader api, proxies, generators, destructuring, @symbols (the
    really hard/impossible stuff to shim). It also has a built in debug
    API and built in debugger.

        I’m certain someone like Rick Waldron or Alex Russell would have

        spec won’t be ‘complete’ until mid-2013.

    Just a heads up, the proxy proposal is a bit different now than it
    was when I wrote my article and examples. These are now called
    [direct
    proxies](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:direct_proxies)
    to distinguish them from the earlier proxy proposal. The main
    difference is that direct proxies are designed specifically to wrap
    an object whereas the original proxies were just generic objects
    that had no relationship to any other objects. As far as I know, no
    browsers have implemented direct proxies yet (Firefox and Chrome
    still have the old proxy implementation).

        Thank you Nicholas. I greatly appreciate the head’s up regarding
        direct proxies – I wasn’t aware they changed directions. I’ll
        have to check on the status of us updating the old proxy
        implementation in Chrome to the newer proposal. Great work on
        the very thorough write-ups on ES.next that you’ve been

            Direct Proxies landed recently in Firefox (17 or 18). Not in

    Oh oh. The classical programmers have invaded. I wonder what
    Crockford thinks of all this?

    Javascript is not a classical language, and any attempt of making it
    so is obfuscation. GWT. So I cringed a bit when you called the
    classes example a “semantic improvement”. But I suppose that from
    the perspective of a classical programmer, that would be true. “This
    is what I mean in the language I understand. Now javascript, convert
    this to something you understand.”

    I empathize with Dumbunny on collections in javascript. Probably not
    a coincidence that my favorite languages (php, C, javascript) are
    the simplest and don’t have many datatypes.

        Just want to point out that this actually is a semantic
        enhancement.\
         I don’t know how much you use .NET and/or LINQ, but there were
        the same arguments when LINQ was introduced.\
         The idea is that instead of writing HOW something should be
        done, I would rather write WHAT I want to do. The language is
        smart enough to figure out how this should be done, for me.\
         The way I see it, the issue is the name, not the feature.
        Because, like you said, these are not actually classes in the
        classical sense, but rather just syntactic sugar for objects and
        prototypes. If only we could think of a better name that
        describes what we are trying to accomplish.

    Nice review!\
     There is small inaccuracy regarding observables. As far as i know
    AngularJS dosen’t have observables, it is doing “dirty checking” of
    properties, not getters and setters. KnockoutJS on the other hand
    has really great observables, better use it as example.

    ES.next is the salvation for Javascript. It will take Javascript
    from “too simple” to “just right simple” . Remember: Everything
    should be as simple as possible but no simpler. JS extreme
    simplicity in fact complicated things unnecessarily. With ES.next JS
    reaches the perfect middle term between too simple and bloated. I
    believe in harmony. People complaining are obssessed with
    minimalism. Except that minimalism is as much evil as ‘bloatism’ is.
    Yeah JS needed native module support (i dislike every current module
    system), yeah JS needed lightweight classes and now we got them.

        Maybe … but I’m concerned that once the ball gets rolling, it
        won’t stop until Javascript becomes bloated – I can’t see
        Occam’s razor applied to what’s being added to the language.

        Weak maps are just a workaround for memory leaks – but memory
        leaks should be fixed, not worked around. Sets can be easily
        implemented with what the language already provides, with O[ log
        n] complexity for insertion and search. Module loading will
        always be platform-dependant, why pack it into the language
        spec? Object.observe is half-baked – it doesn’t allow proper
        property validation or transformation, and it introduces
        problems related to the order of execution.

        What I like is classes and let. Default parameter values are
        syntactic sugar, but IMO unlikely to have bad side effects – as
        opposed to Object.observe and proxies (IMO hiding function calls
        behind assignments is a bad idea in any language not supporting
        operator overloading – it makes the caller unaware of the
        potential cost of his assignment). I’d rather keep Array.from as
        a shim than having it part of the language – it adds to the
        interpreter complexity without adding significant benefits when
        compared to a shim, IMO.

            What JavaScript really needs is a strong focus on
            “mechanism, not policy”. Alas, that’s highly unlikely, given
            that it’s now a design-by-comittee language and has a
            particularly awful (read: highly political) committee at
            that.

    Sets are implicitly unique
    ![;)](http://addyosmani.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)

    Ex:

    new Set([ 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4 ]); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

    So you could make a unique array like this:

    var unique = Array.from(new Set([ 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4 ]));

    … Currently spread is spec’ed to disallow a similar behaviour, but I
    suspect that after next week’s TC39 meeting, the following will be
    allowed:

    var unique = [ ... new Set([ 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4 ]) ];

        Even if not using the constructor this way, the set.has(value)
        test is unnecessary. Adding an element will perform the same
        test. Which is a great thing about sets. You just keep adding
        stuff and don’t worry about duplicates.

    I love the new features, and I love the performance improvements
    modern browsers have recently delivered.

    My question is how much of a performance hit are we going to have to
    absorb using the new features?

    Will be be back to poor performing javascript?

        Re unrelated: I have indeed. The challenge with the last

        the larger resources available on the site, but I might try
        experimenting with a wider layout in the next refresh. I

    So ES6 classes will be sugar, rather than a new feature? As much as
    prototypical syntax and semantics can be confusing to developers who
    spend more time in class-based languages, I do not want to see the
    fundamental paradigm of Javascript become fractured. Even
    introducing the “class” keyword may confuse new developers, but I’m
    guessing this change was made for a good reason.

    Modules, on the other hand, thank God for them. Great addition to
    the spec.

    It’s good to see JS getting some significant, useful updates based
    on how JS is already being used in the real world. I’d like to see
    Javascript expanded out so that we have to rely less on ‘frameworks’
    and plugins and can do more with JS natively. Having things in-built
    means it is easier to standardise and it’s easier to apply
    best-practice, and also less HTTP requests per page due to including
    fewer JS libraries.

### About

![image](http://addyosmani.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/avatar-2014.jpeg)I'm
an engineer at Google working with the Chrome team to build tools to
help improve developer productivity and satisfaction.

I've also written ['Developing Backbone.js
Applications'](http://addyosmani.github.com/backbone-fundamentals) and
['Learning JavaScript Design
Patterns'](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/).

### Fundamentals

**First do it, then do it right, then do it better.** This is one
fundamental I always keep in mind when developing anything.

If you're a developer wishing to learn something new, regardless of
skill-level, remember that as important as it is to read, it's equally
as important to get out there and \*do\*.

Create a new [gist](http://gist.github.com) or
[JSBin](http://jsbin.com), pop open the
[console](http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/console.html) and
experiment. It's effing fun.
