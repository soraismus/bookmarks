Why I can’t stop using Vim
==========================

In 1992 or 1993, my brother-in-law hired me to help him with some
maintenance on a software system he had written for a customer. It ran
on SCO Xenix.

“Hey, Bro, why doesn’t ‘EDIT’ work on this computer?” I was a DOS rookie
back in those early days, having just started my major in Computer
Science.

“Um, there’s no EDIT command on Xenix. Let me introduce you to vi. You
use hjkl to move around, plus a few other keystrokes. Once you get used
to it, it’s not that bad.” I swear he had a sly grin on his face as he
said that, but he was serious. Vi was what I was going to have to use.
Only now, as I write this, do I recall that he was, at that time,
working in Windows with a shiny graphical editor. Oh, well, he was the
boss, after all.

Anyway, I learned to move around pretty quickly, hitting ‘i’ to start
typing, and ‘Esc’ to move around again. I wouldn’t say I was a wizard,
but I got the work done. We would tap away on Wednesday nights and
Saturday mornings in our work sessions, while our wives played Super
Mario Brothers out in the front room. Good times. I really miss it
sometimes.

That was the side job. The day job kept me programming on OS/2 and some
Windows. The stock editor on OS/2 was a decent editor – you typed text,
and it saved it just fine. I cranked out many, many lines of code using
that editor.

We’re programmers. Editing text is the very essence of what we do. We
get excited about these sorts of things.

Fast forward to 1997. My brother-in-law once again helped me get my foot
in the door at a small telecommunications company in Phoenix. My first
workstation was a Sun SPARCstation 20, running Solaris. Cool, I thought,
I can use vi to get going. But by now, everyone was using UltraEdit on
their Windows machines. I didn’t have one of those, but I really needed
the productivity boost of a better editor. A little Yahoo searching
turned up some vi clone called [Vim](http://www.vim.org "Link to Vim").
There was a new release of it, version 5, and it came with syntax
highlighting! Take that, UltraEdit!

This is getting long… Let’s just say, I used Vim for all my editing on
that SPARC station. And when I finally got a Windows PC, I was elated to
find that there was a Windows version of Vim, with a GUI and everything!

Vim and I have had a bit of a fickle relationship over the years.
Although it does an amazing job helping you type text, it’s not flashy,
and it’s not perfect, and because of those imperfections, I strayed from
time to time, looking for something to fix those imperfections, and
still give me the second-nature editing reflexes I had come to enjoy
from Vim.

Here’s a list of the things that have caused me to look beyond Vim.

-   viml – Vim’s built in scripting language is tedious to work in. Some
    folks have done some amazing things with it, but, try as I have, I
    can’t get myself to enjoy it.
-   Glossy finish – I admit, I’m guilty of a little editor envy when I
    see some of the prettier interfaces out there, especially these
    days.
-   Emacs’s Org Mode – this is such a killer emacs app. Others have
    tried to replicate it for Vim. Someday.
-   Context-aware code completion – OmniComplete provides a decent
    framework, but nobody has really matched the power of Visual Studio,
    Eclipse, or Xcode.

Yes, I have strayed, and flirted with many other editors…

-   [JEdit](http://www.jedit.org) (Ugh, looks like a Java Swing App, and
    too much clutter everywhere)
-   [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (Love the features and
    the eLISP, but can’t tolerate the myriad key chords needed to
    navigate around my files.)
-   Emacs + [Evil Mode](https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home) (Evil
    mode is REALLY good. The only thing that made me frown was poor code
    navigation via ETAGS.)
-   [J](http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net) (A tiny little Java based
    editor, built around ABCLisp from Armed Bear. I really loved this
    editor, but it fell behind in features, and I needed more power.)
    EDIT: This editor is still alive (somewhat) on github:
    [https://github.com/kevinkrouse/j/tree/master/j](https://github.com/kevinkrouse/j/tree/master/j).
    Thanks to bokchoi on ihackernews.com for the link.
-   [Programmers Notepad](http://www.pnotepad.org) (Decent editor, but
    not enough features).
-   [Editra](http://editra.org) (a Python/WxWindows based editor, with
    Vi emulation. But it also lacked things like smart indent and other
    features I have come to take for granted.)
-   [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org) (A very respectable
    editor. Tons of features. But for some reason, I just don’t enjoy
    using it. Maybe it’s all the visual clutter around the borders of
    the screen?)
-   [Visual SlickEdit](http://www.slickedit.com) (I actually bought a
    license for this once, about a decade ago. I liked using it, but I
    could only afford one platform, and there are lots of free editors
    that do most of the same things. With Vim in my toolbox, I’ll never
    pay $300 to edit text.)
-   [TextMate](http://macromates.com) (When on a Mac, it had to be
    tried. The free TextMate 2 is a great editor, and I flirted with
    this one the longest. Were it not for the things I’m about to
    mention below, I’d be using this editor as much as possible.)
-   A whole slew of respected MacOS based editors: Kod, Smultron,
    SublimeText, TextWrangler, etc.

Here’s where they all fell short, and what took me back to Vim every
time…

-   hjkl for navigation
-   / for searching (really, no other editor has made it this simple)
-   m to bookmark a spot, ‘ to hop back to it
-   and ctags
-   q to record a macro; @ to execute it again
-   1G to go to the top of the file, G to go to the bottom
-   \^, $ to go to the front, or end, of a line.
-   Text Objects! Holy cow, if you’re a Vim user and you’re not using
    these, you’re missing something special.
-   Platform ubiquity. (Mac, Linux, Windows – Vim works great on all the
    platforms I use day in and day out.)

What it boils down to, really, is that the above keys have become a part
of me. They are so ingrained in my brain and reflexes, that I think of
what I want done in the text and my hands just naturally do it for me.
It’s like drinking water. I don’t have to think about how to go about
bringing the cup to my mouth and tipping it just right. I just do it,
and keep going on about my business.

THAT’s what keeps me coming back to vim.

Yes, it still has its imperfections. I end up using IDE’s for a large
part of the work I do, and they provide a lot of what I wish vim would
do better. But there are some plugins that bring the above features into
those environments…

For Eclipse, I use the
[Vrapper](http://vrapper.sourceforge.net "Link to Vrapper") plugin.
Works great!

For Xcode, I have used
[XVim](http://github.com/JugglerShu/XVim "Link to Xvim"). It’s not
perfect, and crashes Xcode in a couple of situations. But it’s getting
better, and is actively developed.

As a special bonus for having read my lengthy article all the way to the
bottom. Here’s a chunk of my .vimrc that allows me to have nested
“project” settings in my directory tree…

    " Search for any .vimsettings files in the path to the file.
    " Source them if you find them.
    function! ApplyLocalSettings(dirname)
        " Don't try to walk a remote directory tree -- takes too long, too many
        " what if's
        let l:netrwProtocol = strpart(a:dirname, 0, stridx(a:dirname, "://"))
        if l:netrwProtocol != ""
            return
        endif

        " Convert windows paths to unix style (they still work)
        let l:curDir = substitute(a:dirname, "", "/", "g")
        let l:parentDir = strpart(l:curDir, 0, strridx(l:curDir, "/"))
        if isdirectory(l:parentDir)
            call ApplyLocalSettings(l:parentDir)
        endif

        " Now walk back up the path and source .vimsettings as you find them. This
        " way child directories can 'inherit' from their parents
        let l:settingsFile = a:dirname . "/.vimsettings"
        if filereadable(l:settingsFile)
            exec ":source " . l:settingsFile
        endif
    endfunction
    autocmd! BufEnter * call ApplyLocalSettings(expand("<afile>:p:h"))

I posted it to Reddit a couple of years ago, and the feedback was
overall positive. There were a few good ideas posted in the comments, so
[here’s the
link](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/12tpf9/per_project_vim_settings/).

Thanks for reading. I’d love to hear your feedback below.

    “We’re programmers. Editing text is the very essence of what we do.”

    I’m a programmer. Writing and editing and debugging programs is the
    very essence of what I do. Editing lines of text is simply an
    implementation detail which describes how most programming has been
    for the past couple decades.

    When my father learned to program, programming consisted of flipping
    switches. When my first boss learned to program, programming
    consisted of punching Hollerith cards. When I first learned to
    program, programming consisted of entering hexadecimal opcodes. In
    hindsight, it’s clear that none of these is the very essence of
    programming.

    I sincerely hope that we’re not stuck forever with today’s
    convention of writing programs out of raw ASCII text, with funny
    punctuation (the kind common on our keyboards by historical
    accident, but almost never used for actual text) and the occasional
    whitespace for style. Computing didn’t get stuck on front-panel
    switches, Hollerith cards, or hexadecimal opcodes, convenient as
    each of these was in its day.

    My father is still suspicious of any computer that doesn’t have
    lights and switches on the front panel for debugging, and I’m sure
    most of today’s programmers will have trouble adapting to
    post-textual programming, too, but time moves on. Vim will
    eventually die out not because there’s going to be a better text
    editor that will convert all the Vim users, but because text itself
    as a fundamental representation will die out. Vim will be a good
    solution to an obsolete problem, like the hand-crank on the front of
    the R1 which could step the processor forward 60 instructions at
    once.

    Awesome post. As a vim enthusiast too, I love it when others get
    around to sharing why they used vim. But your article here says
    more. It shows that it’s important not to get married to your
    editor, and only from the experience of trying other editors do you
    a) have the right to share the pros and cons of vim and b)
    appreciate how powerful vim can be.

    Also, [Vim Awesome](http://vimawesome.com) is a great little repo
    for searching for plugins!

        I’ve learned to never actually delete Vim when I go exploring
        another editor. I just know that I’ll be back someday. I have
        always come back, and been happy to do so each time.

        But, oh, how I wish I had an Org-Mode equivalent for Vim, today!

    Thanks for sharing your story. Just want to say that I nodded all
    way true, feeling very familiar to what you say.

    I think it boils down to the fact that once you have a two-mode
    editor engraved in your fingers and brain, it is impossible to feel
    at home elsewhere. I switched to vi(m) in -96 (leaving emacs), and
    have at times tried the new glossy editors. But it is impossible to
    switch back to single-mode.

    And which other editor have something like cib – try that next time
    you need to replace some text inside parenthesis:)

    Well written but opinionated article. But the reason I post is
    because of the Vim key mapping plugin which I occasionally engage in
    IntelliJ IDEA studio. This might interest you and I noticed it
    wasn’t on your list. Although its hard to unbloat the software (boot
    time of the program and indexing can be slow unless you have a SSD,)
    I’ve come to enjoy the versatility and modernity of this particular
    IDE.

            I am really enjoying IdeaVim plugin for IntelliJ IDEA –
            using it with PyCharm for Python development. There’re
            couple of imperfections that don’t really get in the way,
            but other than that my productivity is very high due to
            having both powerful IDE and Vim combined.

        I’m going to have to re-train my brain to hit `gg` instead.
        Thanks to Christopher, Sean, and bibliotranstornado for point
        this out. Definitely faster than the `1-<shift>-g` I’ve been
        using for 20+ years!

        Funny story – that brother-in-law tried to teach me that the
        easiest way to get to the end of a line of text was to type
        `1234l`. I’m glad I quickly realized there were better ways. :)

    You might prefer “gg” to “1G”. It does the same thing and is
    quicker.

    For going to first line “gg” is speedy than “1G”.

    Thanks for the article.

    Bye, I must search what Text objects are.

    “Context-aware code completion – OmniComplete provides a decent
    framework, but nobody has really matched the power of Visual Studio,
    Eclipse, or Xcode.”\
     Have u tried Eclim? it works more then perfect for me. (Eclim is a
    headless eclipse server, with which u can interact through vim)

        I tried getting Eclim to work several years ago and never got it
        right. I know a few people like yourself that love it. I may
        have to give it another shot.\

            Clang complete.\

            [https://github.com/asolanki/cs1501-final.git](https://github.com/asolanki/cs1501-final.git)\
             C-x C-u\
             or just foo-\> and the list of possible completions pops
            up. And it’s a proper list populated by clang (or clang++)
            parsing your code and knowing what’s legal rather than just
            guessing. Jumps to definitions without having to create a
            tags file too.

                Thanks for mentioning it. I should have mentioned it in
                the main article. I have used clang-complete and love
                it. I work in something of a polyglot environment, where
                C/C++/ObjC are only used occasionally, and the client
                project I have worked on since finding clang-complete is
                a complete mess to set up (literally hundreds of -I
                includes and -D defines).
