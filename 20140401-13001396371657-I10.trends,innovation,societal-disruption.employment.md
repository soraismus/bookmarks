“OUR ROBOTS PUT people to work,” says the rejected slogan still on the
whiteboard in Rodney Brooks’s office. It was meant to convey the belief
that led Mr Brooks to start Rethink Robotics: that robots in small
manufacturing businesses can create new jobs, or at least bring old ones
back from China, thus helping to launch an American manufacturing
renaissance. But the message could also be read another way: robot
overlords forcing human helots into back-breaking labour. Better left
unsaid.

Small and medium-sized companies are between 20 and 200 times less
likely to use robots than large ones in similar sectors, according to a
study carried out by Metra Martech, a consultancy, for the IFR. They
could thus become an important market if someone were to offer them the
right robots, which would open up new sectors of the economy to the
productivity gains that can come with automation. Such robots would
still do routine tasks but would be able to switch from one set of tasks
to another as required, perhaps every few weeks, perhaps a couple of
times a day. They would therefore be heavily dependent on their human
fellow workers to set them up and get them going.

Rethink reckons it has the right robot for the job in Baxter, a
two-armed quasi-humanoid (it cannot move itself) that can be easily
adapted to a number of packaging and assembly tasks. It embodies a lot
of innovative technology. The joints of its arms use a relatively new
gizmo called a series elastic actuator which gives the robot’s software
control over the amount of force that they exert at any given time,
rather than just their location in space (an innovation pioneered by Mr
Pratt, now running robotics at DARPA). This makes Baxter very safe to be
around; if it meets unexpected resistance from, say, the head of a human
worker, it will stop before any harm is done.

Baxter also has a splendidly intuitive programming interface. By
grasping Baxter’s wrists, an operator can easily take it through new
movements; the robot’s “face”—a screen with animated eyes which show
what Baxter is “paying attention to”, among other things—helps gauge the
success of the programming. Mike Fair of Rethink says it took him just a
couple of hours to teach Baxter to make a cup of coffee using a kitchen
coffee-maker, and he did not have to touch a computer keyboard. That all
this cleverness could be put into a machine that sells for just $25,000
has amazed many of Mr Brooks’s former colleagues in academia.

However, Baxter has not taken the market by storm, perhaps in part
because it started off rather imprecise in its movements (a software
upgrade, Mr Brooks says, has improved precision a lot). Being designed
for a market that almost by definition barely knows it wants such a
thing has not made life any easier. Rethink laid off some workers last
December and is trying harder to sell Baxter to robotics researchers.
One former colleague of Mr Brooks’s sees this as a potentially dangerous
splitting of the company’s attention: if Baxter is to succeed as a
practical robot, the company should concentrate on the robot’s
industrial users.

More broadly, though, the idea that robots are no longer the preserve of
manufacturers with capital budgets in the tens of millions of dollars is
taking root, alongside the idea that such robots offer industrial
countries a way of keeping, or winning back, jobs that would otherwise
be carried out in places where labour is a lot cheaper. Universal
Robots, which has less nifty technology than Rethink but perhaps a more
down-to-earth approach to the market, is taken seriously in Denmark in
part because Danish workers are among the most expensive in the world
and will keep their jobs, or find new ones, only by becoming ever more
productive. Integrating ever more user-friendly robots into the human
teams on the factory and workshop floor could offer such productivity
gains, especially when the strengths of the robots are used to the
full—for example, when robot precision is used to guide work carried out
by human hands.

Is this time different?

Robot-makers see their wares as a way of creating employment, both by
allowing companies to make existing products more efficiently and by
enabling them to manufacture new things that could not be made in any
other way, such as ever more precisely engineered electronics and cars,
not to mention films like “Gravity”. Others fear that their net effect
will be to destroy a lot of jobs, and indeed that they may already be
doing so. Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford, has seen a big
change of heart about such technological unemployment in his discipline
recently. The received wisdom used to be that although new technologies
put some workers out of jobs, the extra wealth they generated increased
consumption and thus created jobs elsewhere. Now many economists are
taking the short- to medium-term risk to jobs far more seriously, and
some think the potential scale of change may be huge. Mr Thrun draws a
parallel with employment in agriculture, which accounted for almost all
jobs in the pre-modern era but has since shrunk to just 2% of the
workforce. The advent of robots will have a similar effect, he predicts,
but over a much shorter period. Even so, he is sure that human ingenuity
will generate new jobs, just as it created vast new industries to
counteract the decline in agricultural employment.

Technological dislocation may create great problems for moderately
skilled workers in the coming decades

Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, both at MIT, also have high hopes
for the long-term effect of robots and similar technologies. But in a
recent book, “The Second Machine Age”, they argue that technological
dislocation may create great problems for moderately skilled workers in
the coming decades. They reckon that innovation has speeded up a lot in
the past few years and will continue at this pace, for three reasons:
the exponential growth in computing power; the progressive digitisation
of things that people work with, from maps to legal texts to
spreadsheets; and the opportunities for innovators to combine an
ever-growing stock of things, ideas and processes into ever more new
products and services.

Between them, these trends might continue to “hollow out” labour markets
in developed countries and, soon enough, developing ones, as more and
more jobs requiring medium levels of skill are automated away. This
helps explain, the authors argue, why the benefits of economic growth
increasingly accrue to a small group of highly paid people, citing in
evidence the lack of growth in America’s median wage and the decline in
workforce participation. A paper by Jeffrey Sachs and Lawrence Kotlikoff
highlights the worrying possibility that this shift could be
self-perpetuating: if automation absorbs jobs previously reserved for
young people, who have not yet had time to build up skills, it will stop
them from acquiring those skills, and its destructive effects will
reverberate down the years.

There is some cause for scepticism. If new technology is eating jobs,
one might expect it to show up more clearly in productivity figures,
which are not changing much—though it is possible that those figures
fail to pick up the benefits of, say, the easier availability of a much
wider range of entertainment through the internet. The rise in the
number of women in the workforce and the effects of globalisation have
also had an effect on the working prospects of American men.

That said, even if it turned out that technology was not the problem,
the fact that people worry about technology and that they project their
technological worries onto robots means that robots would be blamed. In
truth, a noticeable robot presence in a workplace may be a good
indicator that human employment, too, is flourishing there; it shows
that the process is worth investing in. Even in a heavily robotised
modern car factory such as the one which builds Tesla’s electric
cars—perhaps the most advanced such workplace in the world—there are
still a lot of human workers to be seen.

“Invisible” robots, such as Aethon’s Tugs, look like more pernicious job
eaters, ready to take over much of the work that hospital porters do
today. Mr Thrun offers Kiva’s warehouse robots as an example of a
similar labour-replacing system. And software will take over a lot of
the tasks carried out by humans sitting in front of screens. In a recent
study of the susceptibility of jobs to computerisation carried out by
Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne at Oxford University, many of the
job categories at greatest risk involved hardly any manual labour at
all.

Given the doornail dumbness of machines, how can they take over so many
moderately skilled jobs? One of the answers is that if you have enough
doornails and enough data, there are ways of simulating smartness that
are proving good enough to solve an ever greater range of problems, and
that problems restricted to the world of data are much more tractable
than those that require manipulating things in the real world.

Andrew Ng of Stanford is a pioneer and advocate of this sort of “machine
learning”, a product of the trends towards ever cheaper computing power
and ever more widespread digitisation that Mr Brynjolfsson and Mr McAfee
describe. Working with Google, Mr Ng came up with a system that, using
16,000 processors to look at a significant fraction of a video on
YouTube, came to “recognise” cats with no prior knowledge that there was
such a thing. Google uses related approaches to tackle a number of more
practical problems, such as machine translation and voice recognition.
It would be surprising if it did not apply the same sort of thinking to
its new acquisitions in robotics, whether they are used in
manufacturing, in services or for that matter in agriculture or
construction.

To work, perchance to play

Managing changing tasks in a changing world means that many workplaces
will still need humans, but as workplaces become more efficient the
number of people employed will shrink in the long run. William Nordhaus,
a Yale economist, has shown that even though the world has become much
better lit in an ever-widening variety of ways over the past few
centuries, the number of people who provide the ever better lighting has
declined. There is, in the end, only so much light that people can
consume. Many other human needs, too, can probably be satisfied with
less labour in the future, though that will take time.

Whether this job attrition will be too quick to allow for the creation
of new jobs in other sectors of the economy (if, indeed, there are
sectors that can continue to grow without limit) is impossible to say,
not least because it depends on how well society as a whole adapts
through continuing education and other investments. It is even
conceivable that the fruits of greater productivity will be distributed
so as to allow people to work less and spend more time doing other
things. After all, the humour in the double meaning of the message that
“Our robots put people to work” depends on understanding that people do
not necessarily want to work, if they have better things to do.
