**Hawala** or **Hewala**
([Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): حِوالة‎, meaning
*transfer*), also known as **hundi**, is an [informal value transfer
system](/wiki/Informal_value_transfer_system "Informal value transfer system")
based on the performance and honour of a huge network of money brokers,
primarily located in the [Middle East](/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East"),
[North Africa](/wiki/North_Africa "North Africa"), the [Horn of
Africa](/wiki/Horn_of_Africa "Horn of Africa"), and the [Indian
subcontinent](/wiki/Indian_subcontinent "Indian subcontinent"),
operating outside of, or parallel to, traditional banking, financial
channels, and [remittance](/wiki/Remittance "Remittance") systems.

Origins[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hawala&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Origins")]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Hawala* itself influenced the development of the
[agency](/wiki/Agency_(law) "Agency (law)") in [common
law](/wiki/Common_law "Common law") and in [civil
laws](/wiki/Civil_law_(private_law) "Civil law (private law)"), such as
the *[aval](/wiki/Aval "Aval")* in [French
law](/wiki/Law_of_France "Law of France") and the *avallo* in Italian
law. The words *aval* and *avallo* were themselves derived from
*hawala*.^[[1]](#cite_note-1)^ The transfer of
[debt](/wiki/Debt "Debt"), which was "not permissible under [Roman
law](/wiki/Roman_law "Roman law") but became widely practiced in
medieval Europe, especially in [commercial
transactions](/wiki/Commercial_transaction "Commercial transaction")",
was due to the large extent of the "trade conducted by the Italian
cities with the Muslim world in the Middle Ages". The agency was also
"an institution unknown to Roman law" as no "individual could conclude a
binding contract on behalf of another as his
[agent](/wiki/Agent_(law) "Agent (law)")". In Roman law, the "contractor
himself was considered the party to the contract and it took a second
contract between the person who acted on behalf of a principal and the
latter in order to transfer the rights and the obligations deriving from
the contract to him". On the other hand, Islamic law and the later
common law "had no difficulty in accepting agency as one of its
institutions in the field of contracts and of obligations in
general".^[[2]](#cite_note-2)^

Hawala is believed to have arisen in the financing of long-distance
trade around the emerging capital trade centers in the early medieval
period. In [South Asia](/wiki/South_Asia "South Asia"), it appears to
have developed into a fully-fledged money market instrument, which was
only gradually replaced by the instruments of the formal [banking
system](/wiki/Bank "Bank") in the first half of the 20th century. Today,
hawala is probably used mostly for migrant workers'
[remittances](/wiki/Remittance "Remittance") to their countries of
origin.

How hawala works[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hawala&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: How hawala works")]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the most basic variant of the hawala system, money is transferred via
a network of hawala brokers, or *hawaladars*. It is the transfer of
money without actually moving it. In fact, a successful definition of
the hawala system that is used is "money transfer without money
movement".

[![image](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Hawala.png/220px-Hawala.png)](/wiki/File:Hawala.png)

[![image](//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.24wmf17/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png)](/wiki/File:Hawala.png "Enlarge")

Hawala example transaction; see text for an explanation

The figure shows how Hawala works: (1) a customer (*A*, left-hand side)
approaches a hawala broker (*X*) in one city and gives a sum of money
(red arrow) that is to be transferred to a recipient (*B*, right-hand
side) in another, usually foreign, city. Along with the money, he
usually specifies something like a password that will lead to the money
being paid out (blue arrows). (2b) The hawala broker *X* calls another
hawala broker *M* in the recipient's city, and informs *M* about the
agreed password, or gives other disposition instructions of the funds.
Then, the intended recipient (*B*), who also has been informed by *A*
about the password (2a), now approaches *M* and tells him the agreed
password (3a). If the password is correct, then *M* releases the
transferred sum to *B* (3b), usually minus a small commission. *X* now
basically owes *M* the money that *M* had paid out to *B*; thus *M* has
to trust *X*'s promise to settle the debt at a later date.

The unique feature of the system is that no [promissory
instruments](/wiki/Promissory_note "Promissory note") are exchanged
between the hawala brokers; the transaction takes place entirely on the
[honour system](/wiki/Honour_system "Honour system"). As the system does
not depend on the legal enforceability of claims, it can operate even in
the absence of a legal and juridical environment. Trust and extensive
use of connections, such as family relations and regional affiliations,
are the components that distinguish it from other remittance systems.

Informal records are produced of individual transactions, and a running
tally of the amount owed by one broker to another is kept. Settlements
of debts between hawala brokers can take a variety of forms (such as
goods, services, properties, transfers of employees, etc.), and need not
take the form of direct cash transactions.

In addition to commissions, hawala brokers often earn their profits
through bypassing official [exchange
rates](/wiki/Exchange_rate "Exchange rate"). Generally, the funds enter
the system in the source country's currency and leave the system in the
recipient country's currency. As settlements often take place without
any foreign exchange transactions, they can be made at other than
official exchange rates.

Hawala is attractive to customers because it provides a fast and
convenient transfer of funds, usually with a far lower commission than
that charged by banks. Its advantages are most pronounced when the
receiving country applies unprofitable exchange rate regulations (as has
been the case for many typical receiving countries such as Pakistan or
Egypt) or when the banking system in the receiving country is less
complex (e.g., due to differences in legal environment in places such as
Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia). Moreover, in some parts of the world it is
the only option for legitimate fund transfers, and has even been used by
aid organizations in areas where it is the best-functioning
institution.^[[3]](#cite_note-Passas.2C_Nikos_2006_pp._46.E2.80.9362-3)^

Regional variants[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hawala&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Regional variants")]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### South Asia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hawala&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: South Asia")]

#### Hundis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hawala&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Hundis")]

Main article: [hundi](/wiki/Hundi "Hundi")

[![image](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/1951_Bombay_Province_Rs_2500_Hundi.jpg/220px-1951_Bombay_Province_Rs_2500_Hundi.jpg)](/wiki/File:1951_Bombay_Province_Rs_2500_Hundi.jpg)

[![image](//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.24wmf17/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png)](/wiki/File:1951_Bombay_Province_Rs_2500_Hundi.jpg "Enlarge")

A 1951 hundi of Bombay Province for Rs 2500 with a pre-printed [revenue
stamp](/wiki/Revenue_stamp "Revenue stamp").

The *hundi* is a financial instrument that developed on the Indian
sub-continent for use in trade and credit transactions. Hundis are used
as a form of remittance instrument to transfer money from place to
place, as a form of credit instrument or IOU to borrow money and as a
[bill of exchange](/wiki/Bill_of_exchange "Bill of exchange") in trade
transactions. The [Reserve Bank of
India](/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India "Reserve Bank of India") describes
the Hundi as "an unconditional order in writing made by a person
directing another to pay a certain sum of money to a person named in the
order."^[[4]](#cite_note-4)^

#### Angadia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hawala&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Angadia")]

The word *angadia* means courier in Hindi, but also designates those who
act as hawaladars within India. These people mostly act as a parallel
banking system for businessmen. They charge a commission of around
0.2–0.5% per transaction from transferring money from one city to
another.

### Horn of Africa[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hawala&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Horn of Africa")]

According to the CIA, with the dissolution of Somalia's formal banking
system, many informal money transfer operators have arisen to fill the
void. It estimates that such *hawaladars* are now responsible for the
transfer of up to $1.6 billion per year in remittances to the
country,^[[5]](#cite_note-CIAhaw-5)^ most coming from working Somalis
outside Somalia.^[[6]](#cite_note-CBShaw-6)^ Such funds have in turn had
a stimulating effect on local business
activity.^[[5]](#cite_note-CIAhaw-5)^^[[6]](#cite_note-CBShaw-6)^

### West Africa[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hawala&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: West Africa")]

[The 2012 Tuareg
rebellion](/wiki/Tuareg_rebellion_(2012) "Tuareg rebellion (2012)") has
left Northern Mali without official money transfer service for months.
The coping mechanisms that appeared are patterned on the Hawala
system.^[[7]](#cite_note-04385FSIHSD3-7)^

Post-9/11 money laundering crackdowns[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hawala&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Post-9/11 money laundering crackdowns")]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some government officials assert that hawala can be used to facilitate
money laundering, avoid taxation, and move wealth
anonymously.^[*[citation\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^
As a result, it is illegal in some U.S. states, India,
Pakistan,^[[8]](#cite_note-8)^ and some other
countries.^[*[citation\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^

After the [September 11 terrorist
attacks](/wiki/September_11,_2001_attacks "September 11, 2001 attacks"),
the American government suspected that some hawala brokers may have
helped terrorist organizations to transfer money to fund their
activities, but the [9/11
Commission](/wiki/9/11_Commission "9/11 Commission") Report since showed
that that the bulk of the funds were instead sent by an official
inter-bank wire
transfer.^[*[citation\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^
As a result of intense pressure from the U.S. authorities to introduce
systematic anti-money laundering initiatives on a global scale, a number
of hawala networks have been closed down and a number of hawaladars have
been successfully prosecuted for money laundering. However, there is
little evidence that these actions have brought the authorities any
closer to identifying and arresting a significant number of terrorists
or drug smugglers.^[[9]](#cite_note-9)^ Experts emphasize that the
overwhelming majority of those who use these informal networks are doing
so for legitimate purposes, and simply choose to use a transaction
medium other than state-supported banking
systems.^[[3]](#cite_note-Passas.2C_Nikos_2006_pp._46.E2.80.9362-3)^
Today, the hawala system in Afghanistan is instrumental in providing
financial services for the delivery of emergency relief and humanitarian
and developmental aid for the majority of international and domestic
NGOs, donor organizations, and development aid
agencies.^[[10]](#cite_note-10)^

In November 2001, the Bush administration froze the assets of
[Al-Barakat](/wiki/Al-Barakat "Al-Barakat"), a Somali remittance hawala
company used primarily by a large amount of [Somalian
immigrants](/wiki/Somali_diaspora "Somali diaspora"). Many of its agents
in several countries were initially arrested, though later freed after
no concrete evidence against them was found. In August 2006 the last
Al-Barakat representatives were taken off the U.S. terror list, though
some assets remain frozen.^[[11]](#cite_note-Bbc060828-11)^ The mass
media has speculated that [pirates from
Somalia](/wiki/Somali_pirates "Somali pirates") use the hawala system to
move funds internationally, for example into neighboring Kenya, where
these transactions are neither taxed nor
recorded.^[[12]](#cite_note-12)^

In January 2010, the [Kabul](/wiki/Kabul "Kabul") office of New Ansari
Exchange, [Afghanistan](/wiki/Afghanistan "Afghanistan")'s largest
hawala money transfer business, was shuttered following a raid by the
Sensitive Investigative Unit, the country's national anti-[political
corruption](/wiki/Political_corruption "Political corruption") unit,
allegedly because this company was involved in
[laundering](/wiki/Money_laundering "Money laundering") profits from the
illicit [opium](/wiki/Opium "Opium") trade and the moving of cash earned
by [Taliban](/wiki/Taliban "Taliban") through extortion and drug
trafficking. Thousands of records were seized, from which links were
found between money transfers by this company and political and business
figures and NGOs in the country, including relatives of President [Hamid
Karzai](/wiki/Hamid_Karzai "Hamid Karzai").^[[13]](#cite_note-13)^ In
August 2010, Karzai took control of the task force that staged the raid,
and the US-advised anti-corruption group, the Major Crimes Task Force.
He ordered a commission to review scores of past and current
anti-corruption inquests.^[[14]](#cite_note-14)^
