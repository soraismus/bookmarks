Introduction
------------

Git is currently the most widely used version control system in the
world, mostly thanks to GitHub. By that measure, I’d argue that it’s
also the most misunderstood version control system in the world.

This statement probably doesn’t ring true straight away because on the
surface, Git is pretty simple. It’s really easy to pick up if you’ve
come from another VCS like Subversion or Mercurial. It’s even relatively
easy to pick up if you’ve never used a VCS before. Everybody understands
adding, committing, pushing and pulling; but this is about as far as
Git’s simplicity goes. Past this point, Git is shrouded by fear,
uncertainty and doubt.

Once you start talking about branching, merging, rebasing, multiple
remotes, remote-tracking branches, detached HEAD states… Git becomes
less of an easily-understood tool and more of a feared deity. Anybody
who talks about no-fast-forward merges is regarded with quiet
superstition, and even veteran hackers would rather stay away from
rebasing “just to be safe”.

I think a big part of this is due to many people coming to Git from a
conceptually simpler VCS — probably Subversion — and trying to apply
their past knowledge to Git. It’s easy to understand why people want to
do this. Take Subversion, for example. Subversion is simple, right? It’s
just files and folders. Commits are numbered sequentially. Even
branching and tagging is simple — it’s just like taking a backup of a
folder.

Basically, Subversion fits in nicely with our existing computing
paradigms. Everybody understands files and folders. Everybody knows that
revision \#10 was the one after \#9 and before \#11. But these paradigms
break down when you try to apply them to Git’s advanced features.

That’s why trying to understand Git in this way is wrong. Git doesn’t
work like Subversion at all. Which is pretty confusing, right? You can
add and remove files. You can commit your changes. You can generate
diffs and patches which look just like Subversion’s. How can something
which appears so similar really be so different?

Complex systems like Git become much easier to understand once you
figure out how they really work. The goal of this post is to shed some
light on how Git works under the hood. We’re going to take a look at
some of Git’s core concepts including its basic object storage, how
commits work, how branches and tags work, and we’ll look at the
different kinds of merging in Git including the much-feared rebase.
Hopefully at the end of it all, you’ll have a solid understanding of
these concepts and will be able to use some of Git’s more advanced
features with confidence.

It’s worth noting at this point that this guide is not intended to be a
beginner’s introduction to Git. This guide was written for people who
already use Git, but would like to better understand it by taking a peek
under the hood, and learn a few neat tricks along the way. With that
said, let’s begin.

Repositories
------------

At the core of Git, like other VCS, is the repository. A Git repository
is really just a simple key-value data store. This is where Git stores,
among other things:

-   **Blobs**, which are the most basic data type in Git. Essentially, a
    blob is just a bunch of bytes; usually a binary representation of a
    file.
-   **Tree objects**, which are a bit like directories. Tree objects can
    contain pointers to blobs and other tree objects.
-   **Commit objects**, which point to a single tree object, and contain
    some metadata including the commit author and any parent commits.
-   **Tag objects**, which point to a single commit object, and contain
    some metadata.
-   **References**, which are pointers to a single object (usually a
    commit or tag object).

You don’t need to worry about all of this just yet; we’ll cover these
things in more detail later.

The important thing to remember about a Git repository is that it exists
entirely in a single `.git` directory in your project root. There is no
central repository like in Subversion or CVS. This is what allows Git to
be a *distributed* version control system — everybody has their own
self-contained version of a repository.

You can initialize a Git repository anywhere with the `git init`
command. Take a look inside the `.git` folder to get a glimpse of what a
repository looks like.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/demo/demo-repository/.git/
$ ls -l .git
total 32
drwxrwxr-x 2 demo demo 4096 May 24 20:10 branches

drwxrwxr-x 4 demo demo 4096 May 24 20:10 objects
drwxrwxr-x 4 demo demo 4096 May 24 20:10 refs
~~~~

The important directories are `.git/objects`, where Git stores all of
its objects; and `.git/refs`, where Git stores all of its references.

We’ll see how all of this fits together as we learn about the rest of
Git. For now, let’s learn a little bit more about tree objects.

Tree Objects
------------

A tree object in Git can be thought of as a directory. It contains a
list of blobs (files) and other tree objects (sub-directories).

Imagine we had a simple repository, with a `README` file and a `src/`
directory containing a `hello.c` file.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
README
src/
    hello.c
~~~~

This would be represented by two tree objects: one for the root
directory, and another for the `src/` directory. Here’s what they would
look like.

**tree 4da454..**

  ------ ---------- --------
  blob   976165..   README
  tree   81fc8b..   src
  ------ ---------- --------

**tree 81fc8b..**

  ------ ---------- ---------
  blob   1febef..   hello.c
  ------ ---------- ---------

If we draw the blobs (in green) as well as the tree objects (in blue),
we end up with a diagram that looks a lot like our directory structure.

![Git tree
graph](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tree-graph.png)

Notice how given the root tree object, we can recurse through every tree
object to figure out the state of the entire working tree. The root tree
object, therefore, is essentially a snapshot of your repository at a
given time. Usually when Git refers to “the tree”, it is referring to
the root tree object.

Now let’s learn how you can track the history of your repository with
commit objects.

Commits
-------

A commit object is essentially a pointer that contains a few pieces of
important metadata. The commit itself has a hash, which is built from a
combination of the metadata that it contains:

-   The hash of the tree (the root tree object) at the time of the
    commit. As we learned in *Tree Objects*, this means that with a
    single commit, Git can build the entire working tree by recursing
    into the tree.
-   The hash of any parent commits. This is what gives a repository its
    history: every commit has a parent commit, all the way back to the
    very first commit.
-   The author’s name and email address, and the time that the changes
    were authored.
-   The committer’s name and email address, and the time that the commit
    was made.
-   The commit message.

Let’s see a commit object in action by creating a simple repository.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
 $ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/demo/simple-repository/.git/
 $ echo 'This is the readme.' > README
 $ git add README
 $ git commit -m "First commit"
[master (root-commit) d409ca7] First commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README
~~~~

When you create a commit, Git will give you the hash of that commit.
Using `git show` with the `--format=raw` flag, we can see this
newly-created commit’s metadata.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git show --format=raw d409ca7

commit d409ca76bc919d9ca797f39ae724b7c65700fd27

author Joseph Wynn <joseph@wildlyianccurate.com> 1400976134 -0400
committer Joseph Wynn <joseph@wildlyianccurate.com> 1400976134 -0400

    First commit

index 0000000..9761654
--- /dev/null
+++ b/README
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+This is the readme.
~~~~

Notice how although we referenced the commit by the partial hash
`d409ca7`, Git was able to figure out that we actually meant
`d409ca76bc919d9ca797f39ae724b7c65700fd27`. This is because the hashes
that Git assigns to objects are unique enough to be identified by the
first few characters. You can see here that Git is able to find this
commit with as few as four characters; after which point Git will tell
you that the reference is ambiguous.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git show d409c
$ git show d409
$ git show d40
fatal: ambiguous argument 'd40': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
~~~~

References
----------

In previous sections, we saw how objects in Git are identified by a
hash. Since we want to manipulate objects quite often in Git, it’s
important to know their hashes. You could run all your Git commands
referencing each object’s hash, like `git show d409ca7`, but that would
require you to remember the hash of every object you want to manipulate.

To save you from having to memorize these hashes, Git has references, or
“refs”. A reference is simply a file stored somewhere in `.git/refs`,
containing the hash of a commit object.

To carry on the example from *Commits*, let’s figure out the hash of
“First commit” using references only.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
~~~~

`git status` has told us that we are on branch `master`. As we will
learn in a later section, branches are just references. We can see this
by looking in `.git/refs/heads`.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ ls -l .git/refs/heads/
total 4
-rw-rw-r-- 1 demo demo 41 May 24 20:02 master
~~~~

We can easily see which commit `master` points to by reading the file.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ cat .git/refs/heads/master
d409ca76bc919d9ca797f39ae724b7c65700fd27
~~~~

Sure enough, `master` contains the hash of the “First commit” object.

Of course, it’s possible to simplify this process. Git can tell us which
commit a reference is pointing to with the `show` and `rev-parse`
commands.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git show --oneline master
d409ca7 First commit
$ git rev-parse master
d409ca76bc919d9ca797f39ae724b7c65700fd27
~~~~

Git also has a special reference, `HEAD`. This is a “symbolic” reference
which points to the tip of the current branch rather than an actual
commit. If we inspect `HEAD`, we see that it simply points to
`refs/head/master`.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master
~~~~

It is actually possible for `HEAD` to point directly to a commit object.
When this happens, Git will tell you that you are in a “detached HEAD
state”. We’ll talk a bit more about this later, but really all this
means is that you’re not currently on a branch.

Branches
--------

Git’s branches are often touted as being one of its strongest features.
This is because branches in Git are very lightweight, compared to other
VCS where a branch is usually a clone of the entire repository.

The reason branches are so lightweight in Git is because they’re just
references. We saw in *References* that the `master` branch was simply a
file inside `.git/refs/heads`. Let’s create another branch to see what
happens under the hood.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git branch test-branch
$ cat .git/refs/heads/test-branch 
d409ca76bc919d9ca797f39ae724b7c65700fd27
~~~~

It’s as simple as that. Git has created a new entry in `.git/refs/heads`
and pointed it at the current commit.

We also saw in *References* that `HEAD` is Git’s reference to the
current branch. Let’s see that in action by switching to our
newly-created branch.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master
$ git checkout test-branch 
Switched to branch 'test-branch'
$ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/test-branch
~~~~

When you create a new commit, Git simply changes the current branch to
point to the newly-created commit object.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ echo 'Some more information here.' >> README
$ git add README
$ git commit -m "Update README in a new branch"
[test-branch 7604067] Update README in a new branch
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
$ cat .git/refs/heads/test-branch 
76040677d717fd090e327681064ac6af9f0083fb
~~~~

Later on we’ll look at the difference between **local branches** and
**remote-tracking branches**.

Tags
----

There are two types of tags in Git – **lightweight tags** and
**annotated tags**.

On the surface, these two types of tags look very similar. Both of them
are references stored in `.git/refs/tags`. However, that’s about as far
as the similarities go. Let’s create a lightweight tag to see how they
work.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git tag 1.0-lightweight
$ cat .git/refs/tags/1.0-lightweight 
d409ca76bc919d9ca797f39ae724b7c65700fd27
~~~~

We can see that Git has created a tag reference which points to the
current commit. By default, `git tag` will create a lightweight tag.
Note that this is **not a tag object**. We can verify this by using
`git cat-file` to inspect the tag.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git cat-file -p 1.0-lightweight
tree 9d073fcdfaf07a39631ef94bcb3b8268bc2106b1
author Joseph Wynn <joseph@wildlyianccurate.com> 1400976134 -0400
committer Joseph Wynn <joseph@wildlyianccurate.com> 1400976134 -0400

First commit
$ git cat-file -p d409ca7
tree 9d073fcdfaf07a39631ef94bcb3b8268bc2106b1
author Joseph Wynn <joseph@wildlyianccurate.com> 1400976134 -0400
committer Joseph Wynn <joseph@wildlyianccurate.com> 1400976134 -0400

First commit
~~~~

You can see that as far as Git is concerned, the `1.0-lightweight` tag
and the `d409ca7` commit are the *same object*. That’s because the
lightweight tag is *only a reference* to the commit object.

Let’s compare this to an annotated tag.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git tag -a -m "Tagged 1.0" 1.0
$ cat .git/refs/tags/1.0
10589beae63c6e111e99a0cd631c28479e2d11bf
~~~~

We’ve passed the `-a` (`--annotate`) flag to `git tag` to create an
annotated tag. Notice how Git creates a reference for the tag just like
the lightweight tag, but this reference is not pointing to the same
object as the lightweight tag. Let’s use `git cat-file` again to inspect
the object.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git cat-file -p 1.0
object d409ca76bc919d9ca797f39ae724b7c65700fd27
type commit
tag 1.0
tagger Joseph Wynn <joseph@wildlyianccurate.com> 1401029229 -0400

Tagged 1.0
~~~~

This is a **tag object**, separate to the commit that it points to. As
well as containing a pointer to a commit, tag objects also store a tag
message and information about the tagger. Tag objects can also be signed
with a [GPG
key](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard "GNU Privacy Guard")
to prevent commit or email spoofing.

Aside from being GPG-signable, there are a few reasons why annotated
tags are preferred over lightweight tags.

Probably the most important reason is that annotated tags have their own
author information. This can be helpful when you want to know who
created the tag, rather than who created the commit that the tag is
referring to.

Annotated tags are also timestamped. Since new versions are usually
tagged right before they are released, an annotated tag can tell you
when a version was released rather than just when the final commit was
made.

Merging
-------

Merging in Git is the process of joining two histories (usually
branches) together. Let’s start with a simple example. Say you’ve
created a new feature branch from `master`, and done some work on it.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git checkout -b feature-branch
Switched to a new branch 'feature-branch'
$ vim feature.html
$ git commit -am "Finished the new feature"
[feature-branch 0c21359] Finished the new feature
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~~

At the same time, you need to fix an urgent bug. So you create a
`hotfix` branch from `master`, and do some work in there.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
$ git checkout -b hotfix
Switched to a new branch 'hotfix'
$ vim index.html
$ git commit -am "Fixed some wording"
[hotfix 40837f1] Fixed some wording
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
~~~~

At this point, the history will look something like this.

![Branching -- hotfix and feature
branch](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/branch-feature-hotfix.png)

Now you want to bring the bug fix into `master` so that you can tag it
and release it.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
$ git merge hotfix
Updating d939a3a..40837f1
Fast-forward
 index.html | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
~~~~

Notice how Git mentions **fast-forward** during the merge. What this
means is that all of the commits in `hotfix` were directly upstream from
`master`. This allows Git to simply move the `master` pointer up the
tree to `hotfix`. What you end up with looks like this.

![Branching -- after merging
hotfix](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/branch-merge-hotfix.png)

Now let’s try and merge `feature-branch` into `master`.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git merge feature-branch 
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 feature.html | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~~

This time, Git wasn’t able to perform a fast-forward. This is because
`feature-branch` isn’t directly upstream from `master`. This is clear on
the graph above, where `master` is at commit **D** which is in a
different history tree to `feature-branch` at commit **C**.

So how did Git handle this merge? Taking a look at the log, we see that
Git has actually created a new “merge” commit, as well as bringing the
commit from `feature-branch`.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git log --oneline
8ad0923 Merge branch 'feature-branch'
0c21359 Finished the new feature
40837f1 Fixed some wording
d939a3a Initial commit
~~~~

Upon closer inspection, we can see that this is a special kind of commit
object — it has **two parent commits**. This is referred to as a **merge
commit**.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git show --format=raw 8ad0923

commit 8ad09238b0dff99e8a99c84d68161ebeebbfc714
tree e5ee97c8f9a4173f07aa4c46cb7f26b7a9ff7a17
parent 40837f14b8122ac6b37c0919743b1fd429b3bbab

author Joseph Wynn <joseph@wildlyinaccurate.com> 1401134489 +0100
committer Joseph Wynn <joseph@wildlyinaccurate.com> 1401134489 +0100

 Merge branch 'feature-branch'
~~~~

This means that our history graph now looks something like this (commit
**E** is the new merge commit).

![Branching -- after merging
feature-branch](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/branch-merge-feature.png)

Some people believe that this sort of history graph is undesirable. In
the *Rebasing (Continued)* section, we’ll learn how to prevent
non-fast-forward merges by rebasing feature branches before merging them
with `master`.

Rebasing
--------

Rebasing is without a doubt one of Git’s most misunderstood features.
For most people, `git rebase` is a command that should be avoided at all
costs. This is probably due to the extraordinary amount of
scaremongering around rebasing. *“Rebase Considered Harmful”*, and
*“Please, stay away from rebase”*are just two of the many anti-rebase
articles you will find in the vast archives of the Internet.

But rebase isn’t scary, or dangerous, so long as you understand what it
does. But before we get into rebasing, I’m going to take a quick
digression, because it’s actually much easier to explain rebasing in the
context of cherry-picking.

Cherry-Picking
--------------

What git cherry-pick does is take one or more commits, and replay them
on top of the current commit. Imagine a repository with the following
history graph.

![Node graph -- before
cherry-pick](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cherry-pick-before.png)

If you are on commit **D** and you run `git cherry-pick F`, Git will
take the changes that were introduced in commit **F** and replay them
*as a new commit* (shown as **F’**) on top of commit **D.**

![Node graph -- after
cherry-pick](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cherry-pick-after.png)

The reason you end up with a *copy* of commit **F** rather than commit
**F** itself is due to the way commits are constructed. Recall that the
parent commit is part of a commit’s hash. So despite containing the
exact same changes, author information and timestamp; **F’** will have a
different parent to **F**, giving it a different hash.

A common workflow in Git is to develop features on small branches, and
merge the features one at a time into the master branch. Let’s recreate
this scenario by adding some branch labels to the graphs.

![Node graph -- with branch
labels](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/graph-branch-labels.png)

As you can see, `master` has been updated since `foo` was created. To
avoid potential conflicts when `foo` is merged with `master`, we want
bring `master`‘s changes into `foo`. Because `master` is the *base*
branch, we want to play `foo`‘s commits *on top* of `master`.
Essentially, we want to change commit **C**‘s parent from **B** to
**F**.

It’s not going to be easy, but we can achieve this with
`git cherry-pick`. First, we need to create a temporary branch at commit
**F**.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git checkout master
$ git checkout -b foo-tmp
~~~~

![Node graph -- after creating
foo-tmp](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/foo-tmp.png)

Now that we have a base on commit **F**, we can `cherry-pick` all of
`foo`‘s commits on top if it.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git cherry-pick C D
~~~~

![Node graph -- after cherry-picking C and
D](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cherry-pick-c-d.png)

Now all that’s left to do is point `foo` at commit **D’**, and delete
the temporary branch `foo-tmp`. We do this with the `reset` command,
which points `HEAD` (and therefore the current branch) at a specified
commit. The `--hard` flag ensures our working tree is updated as well.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git checkout foo
$ git reset --hard foo-tmp
$ git branch -D foo-tmp
~~~~

This gives the desired result of `foo`‘s commits being upstream of
`master`. Note that the original **C** and **D** commits are no longer
reachable because no branch points to them.

![Node graph -- after resetting
foo](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cherry-pick-final.png)

Rebasing (Continued)
--------------------

While the example in *Cherry-Picking* worked, it’s not practical. In
Git, rebasing allows us to replace our verbose cherry-pick workflow…

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git checkout master
$ git checkout -b foo-tmp
$ git cherry-pick C D
$ git checkout foo
$ git reset --hard foo-bar
$ git branch -D foo-bar
~~~~

…With a single command.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git rebase master foo
~~~~

With the format `git rebase <base> <target>`, the `rebase` command will
take all of the commits from `<target>` and play them on top of `<base>`
one by one. It does this without actually modifying `<base>`, so the end
result is a linear history in which `<base>` can be fast-forwarded to
`<target>`.

In a sense, performing a rebase is like telling Git, **“Hey, I want to
pretend that `<target>` was actually branched from `<base>`. Take all of
the commits from `<target>`, and pretend that they happened *after*
`<base>`“**.

Let’s take a look again at the example graph from *Merging* to see how
rebasing can prevent us from having to do a non-fast-forward merge.

![Branching -- after merging
hotfix](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/branch-merge-hotfix.png)

All we have to do to enable a fast-forward merge of `feature-branch`
into `master` is run `git rebase master feature-branch` before
performing the merge.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git rebase master feature-branch
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: Finished the new feature
~~~~

This has brought `feature-branch` directly upstream of `master`.

Now all that’s left to do is let Git perform the merge.

With a solid understanding of Git’s inner workings, some of the more
advanced Git tools start to make more sense.

### git-reflog

Whenever you make a change in Git that affects the tip of a branch, Git
records information about that change in what’s called the reflog.
Usually you shouldn’t need to look at these logs, but sometimes they can
come in *very* handy.

Let’s say you have a repository with a few commits.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git log --oneline
d6f2a84 Add empty LICENSE file
51c4b49 Add some actual content to readme
3413f46 Add TODO note to readme
322c826 Add empty readme
~~~~

You decide, for some reason, to perform a destructive action on your
`master` branch.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git reset --hard 3413f46
HEAD is now at 3413f46 Add TODO note to readme
~~~~

Since performing this action, you’ve realised that you lost some commits
and you have no idea what their hashes were. You never pushed the
changes; they were only in your local repository. `git log` is no help,
since the commits are no longer reachable from `HEAD`.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git log --oneline
3413f46 Add TODO note to readme
322c826 Add empty readme
~~~~

This is where `git reflog` can be useful.

~~~~ {.no-highglight}
$ git reflog
3413f46 HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to 3413f46
d6f2a84 HEAD@{1}: commit: Add empty LICENSE file
51c4b49 HEAD@{2}: commit: Add some actual content to readme
3413f46 HEAD@{3}: commit: Add TODO note to readme
322c826 HEAD@{4}: commit (initial): Add empty readme
~~~~

The reflog shows a list of all changes to `HEAD` in reverse
chronological order. The hash in the first column is the value of `HEAD`
*after the change was made*. We can see, therefore, that we were at
commit `d6f2a84` before the destructive change.

How you want to recover commits depends on the situation. In this
particular example, we can simply do a `git reset --hard d6f2a84` to
restore `HEAD` to its original position. However if we have introduced
new commits since the destructive change, we may need to do something
like `cherry-pick` all the commits that were lost.

Note that Git’s reflog is only a record of changes **for your local
repository. If your local repository becomes corrupt or is deleted, the
reflog won’t be of any use (if the repository is deleted the reflog
won’t exist at all!)**

Depending on the situation, you may find `git fsck` more suitable for
recovering lost commits.

### git-fsck

In a way, Git’s object storage works like a primitive file system —
objects are like files on a hard drive, and their hashes are the
objects’ physical address on the disk. The Git index is exactly like the
index of a file system, in that it contains references which point at an
object’s physical location.

By this analogy, `git fsck` is aptly named after `fsck` (“file system
check”). This tool is able to check Git’s database and verify the
validity and reachability of every object that it finds.

When a reference (like a branch) is deleted from Git’s index, the
object(s) they refer to usually aren’t deleted, even if they are no
longer reachable by any other references. Using a simple example, we can
see this in practice.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git checkout -b foobar
Switched to a new branch 'foobar'
$ echo 'foobar' > foo.txt 
$* git commit -am "Update foo.txt with foobar"
[foobar bcbaac7] Update foo.txt with foobar
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
$ git branch -D foobar
Deleted branch foobar (was bcbaac7).
~~~~

At this point, commit `bcbaac7` still exists in our repository, but
there are no references pointing to it. By search through the database,
`git fsck` is able to find it.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git fsck --lost-found
Checking object directories: 100% (256/256), done.
dangling commit bcbaac709e0b8abbd3f1f322990d204907be5841
~~~~

For simple cases, `git reflog` may be preferred. Where `git fsck` excels
over `git reflog`, though, is when you need to find objects which you
never referenced in your local repository (and therefore would not be in
your reflog). An example of this is when you delete a remote branch
through an interface like GitHub. Assuming the objects haven’t been
garbage-collected, you can clone the remote repository and use
`git fsck` to recover the deleted branch.

### git-stash

// TODO

### git-describe

Git’s `describe` command is summed up pretty neatly in the
documentation:

> git-describe – Show the most recent tag that is reachable from a
> commit

This can be helpful for things like build and release scripts, as well
as figuring out which version a change was introduced in.

`git describe` will take any reference or commit hash, and return the
name of the most recent tag. If the tag points at the commit you gave
it, `git describe` will return only the tag name. Otherwise, it will
suffix the tag name with some information including the number of
commits since the tag and an abbreviation of the commit hash.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git describe v1.2.15
v1.2.15
$ git describe 2db66f
v1.2.15-80-g2db66f5
~~~~

If you want to ensure that only the tag name is returned, you can force
Git to remove the suffix by passing `--abbrev=0`.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git describe --abbrev=0 2db66f
v1.2.15
~~~~

### git-rev-parse

`git rev-parse` is an ancillary plumbing command which takes a wide
range of inputs and returns one or more commit hashes. The most common
use case is figuring out which commit a tag or branch points to.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git rev-parse v1.2.15        
2a46f5e2fbe83ccb47a1cd42b81f815f2f36ee9d
$ git rev-parse --short v1.2.15        
2a46f5e
~~~~

### git-bisect

`git bisect` is an indispensable tool when you need to figure out which
commit introduced a breaking change. The `bisect` command does a binary
search through your commit history to help you find the breaking change
as quickly as possible. To get started simply run `git bisect start`.
Then you need to `bisect` a couple of important hints: you can tell Git
that the commit you’re currently on is broken with `git bisect bad`.
Then, you can give Git a commit that you know is working with
`git bisect good <commit>`.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad
$ git bisect good v1.2.15
Bisecting: 41 revisions left to test after this (roughly 5 steps)
[b87713687ecaa7a873eeb3b83952ebf95afdd853] docs(misc/index): add header; general links
~~~~

Git will checkout a commit and ask you to test whether it’s broken or
not. If the commit is broken, run `git bisect bad`, otherwise if it’s
fine, run `git bisect good`. After a few goes of this, Git will be able
to pinpoint at which commit the breaking change was first introduced.

~~~~ {.no-highlight}
$ git bisect bad
e145a8df72f309d5fb80eaa6469a6148b532c821 is the first bad commit
~~~~

Once the `bisect` is finished (or when you want to abort it), be sure to
run `git bisect reset` to reset `HEAD` to where it was before the
`bisect`.

    great article, but I was truly confused by the directions of the
    arrows in the a-b-c-d-e-f diagrams of commits in rebase/cherry-pick.
    I read it, seeing the arrows as the flow of history forward in time,
    and more or less ignored that the letters were running backwards
    (after all, commit hashes are random looking things, I’m used to
    ignoring their names). I would suggest you have another arrow
    somewhere pointing which direction is forward to save on confusion.

-   Matt S

    I think you should add a section on the reset command before the
    cherry-pick section. Reading from start to finish, it was kind of
    confusing when you suddenly used a new command (which can be tricky
    in its own right) while explaining cherry-pick with only a quick
    explanation of what it does.

    Great guide so far, though. One of the clearer explanations of Git
    internals that I’ve seen.

-   Harro van der Klauw

    In the cherry pick example at the end you say that commits C and D
    are no longer reachable becaus eno branch points to them. But the
    commits are still there right?\
     If I have the revision of those specific commits I would still get
    them.

    I really like the page so far, I hope you manage to finish it!\
     If you’re planning on adding to your ‘rebase’ section, like another
    comment suggested, might I request a bit on interactive git rebase
    and, related, commit squashing? I found reading up on those to be
    really helpful in practice.

    I love Git because of GitHub, but beyond that I am not so taken.
    It’s not that there is something technically wrong with git, rather,
    it is technically very right, but it is in the wrong place. When you
    said “Subversion fits in nicely with our existing computing
    paradigms. Everybody understands files and folders.” That pretty
    much hits the nail on the head. Git has essentially built a file
    system on top of a file system. This limits access to ones files via
    the git gate keeper, so to speak, and a disconnect between the
    actual file system and the vcs (e.g. \`rm foo\` vs \`git rm foo\`).
    I am convinced the next generation of version control system will be
    the one that integrates the concepts of versioning, a la git, into
    the file system itself, allowing us to work once again in the
    conceptual paradigm of files and folders, but with all the benefits
    of version control, a la svn.

    would be helpful to mention how to deal with conflicts during merge
    and rebase

-   http://shime.github.com/ Hrvoje Šimi?

    Couldn’t a problem in a cherry picking example be solved in a
    simpler way? Maybe I’m crazy, but I usually just merge master into
    the feature branch.

    -   Sam Wyman

        I think the point is that it’s a simple, contrived example.
        Especially since that section is used as an introduction to the
        rebase section.

-   http://madhur.github.com Madhur

    The article is good. But I feel there are some missing pieces:

    $ git reset –hard foo-bar\
     $ git branch -D foo-bar\
     What is “foo-bar” here? There is no mention of it in the text.

    Can you elaborate on difference between rebase and merge? In which
    scenarios you prefer one over another.

    -   wildlyinaccurate

        Thank you, that was supposed to be foo-tmp — I’ve fixed that.

        I’d certainly like to expand on merge & rebase; I’ll be adding
        more on that this week. For now though, my rule of thumb is that
        rebase is for bringing feature branches up-to-date with master.
        Merge is for bringing feature branches into master. There are
        other situations, of course, like wanting to bring a feature
        branch up-to-date with another feature branch. Usually in this
        case I’d rebase, but this really depends on the situation. Like
        I said, hopefully I’ll be able to expand on this in the guide
        later.

    -   tunesmith

        I tend to prefer merge over rebase when it is important to me to
        accurately track the dates of when changes were actually first
        committed. Like, when it’s important to see from the revision
        history that I implemented Feature X between 2 and 4pm on
        Tuesday afternoon.

        I tend to prefer rebase over merge when timeline isn’t so
        important, and when I instead want to optimize for gathering
        chunks of commits together into one conceptual whole. Like, if I
        have worked on a new feature privately over a two-week period,
        during a time when bunches of other commits have been pushed to
        origin. If I want to push my feature to origin and have its
        commits bundled together as a cohesive whole (for easier
        review), then rebase is better than merge.

        So it depends on whether you want to optimize for accurate
        history (merge), or clarity of conceptual change (rebase).

        -   mcagl

            Well, man git-rebase mentions this option:

            –committer-date-is-author-date, –ignore-date\
             These flags are passed to git am to easily change the dates
            of the rebased commits (see git-am(1)). Incompatible with
            the –interactive option.

            which is what you want to do when you choose merging instead
            of rebasing, if I understood correctly.

    \>The reason you end up with a copy of commit F rather than commit F
    itself is due to the way commits are constructed. Recall that the
    parent commit is part of a commit’s hash. So despite containing the
    exact same changes, author information and timestamp; F’ will have a
    different parent to F, giving it a different hash.

    This is very misleading. Commits do not contain “changes”, they
    contain full snapshots of the codebase (or whatever files you’re
    tracking). F’ is not a copy of F in any way. F’ is a commit that is
    formed by taking the diff from E to F and applying that diff to D,
    just like 105 is a number formed by taking the difference between 7
    and 12 and adding it to 100. 105 is not a “copy of 12″, and neither
    is F’ a copy of F.

    Furthermore, since commits contain snapshots and not diffs, the hash
    of F’ would be completely different from the hash of F even if their
    parent fields were identical, because they would contain completely
    different tree objects created from completely different blob
    objects. To imply that the reason their hashes are different is
    merely that they have different parents is, well, wildly inaccurate.

    -   wildlyinaccurate

        Thanks for the feedback; I guess the wording could be clearer.
        While a commit doesn’t actually contain a diff, when Git
        performs a cherry-pick it calculates the diff for that commit
        and re-applies it at HEAD. So (and bare with me here), given A
        <– B <– C, if you did \`git reset –hard B\`, reset the
        computer's clock to be the same time that C was committed, and
        then ran \`git cherry-pick C\`… C \*should\* have the exact same
        hash that it did before. At least that's my understanding of it
        — please correct me if I'm wrong!

        -   Keshav Kini

            C will have the exact same hash that it did before, of
            course – no object’s hash ever changes in the git data
            store. Also, and I guess this is what you meant to say,
            \`git cherry-pick\` will have “created” a commit with the
            same hash as C, and moved the current branch pointer to that
            commit. In practice this means that the current branch
            pointer will just move back to C.

            The “reset the computer’s clock to be the same time that C
            was committed” step can be avoided either by setting the
            GIT\_COMMITTER\_DATE environment variable to the date seen
            in the “committer” line of the output of \`git cat-file -p
            C\`, or by invoking \`git cherry-pick\` with the \`–ff\`
            flag. The only reason this step is even necessary is that
            the standard headers of a git commit object contain both an
            authoring date and a committing date. History surgery
            operations like cherry-pick, rebase, etc. tend to preserve
            the author date but update the committer date to the present
            moment, thus changing the hash.

            Note that this has nothing to do with the normal usage of
            \`git cherry-pick\`, which is to cherry pick a commit from
            one branch onto another one, not onto the commit’s own
            parent. My main point was that it’s wrong to say in general
            that C’ is a copy of C or to imply that the only thing
            distinguishing C’ from C is a few differences in the commit
            headers. That’s a fundamental conceptual error.

            -   Krishna Srinivas

                Keshav’s explanation makes sense. Looking forward to the
