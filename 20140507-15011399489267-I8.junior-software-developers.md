Surviving as a Junior software developer
========================================

Posted by [Eric

If it helps, you are never ready, you will never know enough, and the
key is knowing how to cope with that.

At the beginning you may have no idea or a vague sense how to solve the
problem, you will look at the feature and Google it. You will write code
and may even get it working and over time, hours or days it may get
ripped apart and rebuilt. Sometimes you will part of the conversation,
other times you will come back to find its all changed.

In my first months/projec![Climb to
intermediate](http://ericbrooke.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/climb.jpg?w=300&h=225)ts/jobs
I had some amazing moments as I solved problems and got the feature
marked off the list, or I discovered that lttle thing that was stopping
it working. I also has some tough moments, where my code was changed
without\
 any comment, or ripped apart in front of me, sometimes without comment
or another time with the senior developer responding to my questions
with condescending responses.

You will need to separate your self worth i.e. ego from your code. You
will need to manage that nagging sense you are not good enough.

Coding is hard, you need to know so many things, that are constantly
changing and if you are full stack that could be CSS/SASS/COMPASS, HTML,
Javascript/JQuery/CoffeeScript, Rails, Ruby, SQL, GIT, BASH and that is
before we talk about APIs and deployment!

Here are some of thoughts and learnings I gained from my first couple
roles as a junior software developer:

### Read the error message!

The most frustrating thing for your colleagues is when you ask a
question and your testing suite or your log is already telling you
everything you need to know. Have you read the errors and if not
understood them have you googled it? Yes actually copy the entire error
message and paste it in the search bar and press return. Do you know
where all the logs are? No, hunt them down. It is also true that some
error messages really are not helpful, infact they appear to lie, just
look through the stack trace.. I record the really abstract ones, in my
computer notebook with the solutions.

### Code Reviews & Pull Requests

If these are not happening, ask for them, if they are denied look for
the next job. They are fastest way to grow as a developer, whether you
be a junior, intermediate or senior you will learn a lot by others
reviewing you code. And you will learn a lot from watching others get
and give feedback. Yes some people are dicks when giving feedback, maybe
you should give them feedback on their feedback (you might even help out
their friends and lovers! being able to give feedback is crucial for all
human relationships). Innovation and learning comes out of exposing your
code and being vulnerable to feedback.

The best [Pull
Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests "What is a pull request")
comments, point out the issue and then explain why it is wrong (you may
need to train your seniors to put the why, telling the why, is
difference between being treated as a child or an adult). Do not become
a parrot and copy and paste, understand why it is wrong, you will learn
and grow faster. I also have the habit of reviewing my pull requests on
a weekly/bi-weekly basis to see what errors, if any, I am repeating, to
target in my next afterwork homework.

Code reviews when someone senior or intermediate reviews a bunch of your
code are incredibly helpful, in seeing what you are good at and what you
need to improve. If you are alone build up a peer group, who can review
each others code. Either way you should consider reflecting on your own
code every month or so, at the beginning of your journey you learn so
much so fast, that you maybe able to refactor your own code.

The next extension for this, is to put your code open source and then
allow the world to help you improve your code..

### Pair Programming

There is even a better way to learn, yes pair coding it is like having a
sports coach who is giving you constant feedback, and you get better.
This is awesome from a learning perspective. Not only will you learn
about the code but you will see how your colleague use their tools as
well, which will may give you some productivity tips (or vice versa).
Also you are likely to cut problem solving down by 50% in terms of time.
This is not just a technique for juniors of course (its great for on
boarding and teaching your organization code style). All of that said
this scared the hell out of me when I started, I thought I can not
remember all the syntax and options.. Until I saw that most
seniors/intermediates would without a thought Google the function or
command to see what their options are. I learnt that is not important to
remember everything, but to remember that you can.. Now I am less
scared.

### Build out your augmented memory

Whilst watching most seniors, they would often lookup old projects to
see how they had done something in the past. Whether it would be a
Google Drive, Drop Box or even GitHub they would keep most of their old
work. Another trick I saw was the use of notes for each task or type of
task e.g. on Mac they would have a Note (or Evernote) on RSpec and have
all the matchers and examples, or all of the startup scripts for
spinning up a new node, etc. The point to be clear is you will not
remember everything, so have it somewhere useful for you, in fact your
memory just becomes the index of what is possible and where you did it
last.

Also for the tasks that you need for setting up your computer, the
environment and creation of an App, I store all of these on Github, to
help me not forget a step, and also to keep my personalized setup
(colours, BASH paths etc) somewhere,
[here](https://github.com/ericbrooke/setup) is mine. You never know when
you computer will die, or need to be erased, or you just get laid off!

### Separating self worth from your code

Receiving feedback from colleagues can be tough. Some think code is very
rational, logical and lacking of emotion. Thus the feedback can be
equally logic. And some developers can be very cold how they deliver it.
I even had a couple experiences when “seniors” ganged up to give me
feedback, and frankly it was pretty painful to receive. When I asked why
and tried to understand I got cut off and then “shussed”. I walked away
from the situation and then learned not to ask a question to a couple
developers at the same time. That said if someone is a dick to you, you
do not have to return it. Be the adult, because today they could not
be.. I have also had some awesome experiences when my colleagues talked
through issues with my pull request, explained the why and what good
practice options there are. You want as much feedback as you can get.

So you will need to toughen up a bit, process and work through their
comments, and when you do not understand either research it, until you
do, or ask.

### Asking when you need help

There is a balance between asking too few questions and too many. On one
hand you may take too long to solve a problem and build that feature –
on the other hand you may well “piss off” (make grumpy) those senior to
you. This is tough, my general rule is to ask if you cannot figure it
out after 40 minutes.

In my first job I think I did not ask enough, I know I would have grown
faster if I had. That said when you are interrupting someone who is in
the zone, it feels, well, difficult. Also when they are in zone they
often look grumpy, constipated or are frowning and generally look
unapproachable. You will learn the clues on their face over time on when
to ask. Of course my personal view is when my colleagues ask me for
help, I will always help. I have this crazy notion that collaboration is
fun, yes even face to face!

### Growing your knowledge base

Sorry but you are going to have to do homework! Most non-developers have
no clue how much you have to learn and then how fast it is outdated. My
solution for this was to do between two and three hours every night,
then maybe a longer stretch on one weekend day. But there is always one
day completely off. When you are hungry its hard to forget that you are
actually running a marathon and not a sprint.

As with all learning, you will have strengths in some [learning
styles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles). As a developer
you will have to pimp all the styles. I try to mix and improve all my
styles. Really understand what learning style best works for you. Do you
prefer to build and hack together, do you prefer to read/process, do you
enjoy watching videos, do you prefer to learn with others. What makes
that new thing stick in your head? Understand this as you have a LOT to
learn and process.

Personally I like a mix, I use books (yes they are made of paper),
videos (they are so many approaches that you should try a couple
companies to see what works for you), and I have a couple people who I
learn with.

A good book on this topic is [Make It
Stick](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18770267-make-it-stick?from_search=true)

### This is a marathon not a sprint

That thing called work life balance at the beginning of your career is
frankly bollox (bullshit for non brits). That said you should make time
to rest and not think about code. Reflection will allow you to actually
learn the big stuff or that thing you could not connect at first, to
spring understanding on you (Bong). The unconscious mind is a very
powerful learning machine, it needs sleep/dreaming, a different context
and maybe something creative, like music, painting to be fully powered
up. Yes and exercise, dammit, it also helps. And if you are NOT single,
consider those that will love you a lot longer then your job or career
even, yes that includes you dog (or cat), plan that time. And if you are
single, you are more likely to die or suffer a nasty disease, so make
time to meet someone and live longer..

### Watching other developers code

If you watch someone who has many years, you will not only learn their
style in coding, how they write, refactor, and maybe even test. You will
also learn how they use their tools and this can just make you a lot
faster. Peepcode did some fun play by play videos that allows you to see
some of the experts code.

### Reflection – Knowing your code and improving it

Every week I look back at my some of my code and research similar
problems to see if I could refactor it. I sometimes look for web
applications that solved the same problem and see how they approached
the same problem and I consider the why, benefits and drawbacks. I go
through my refactor book and look at my code and question it. I find the
creation process can be different to an editing process, it sometimes
seems a lot easier.

### Working on one thing at a time

I found early on I would try to solve the whole feature in one go rather
then breaking the problem down into is component parts. Now I divide the
feature into a number of tasks and complete the tasks one by one (I even
add them to Pivot Tracker or write them down on a pad of paper!). This
allows my brain to be wholly focused on the problem at hand, rather then
holding the whole code in my brain. I find I chew through tasks faster,
consider out of the box solutions more often as I have that spare RAM to
consider them. I also find if I draw it out, I consider the connections
and external parts to a greater level.

### Commit often

For every feature I now create a branch. After each task is done I push,
well sometimes pull push depending on the time scale. First you will get
mini morale boost, secondly you have a backup, third others can see what
you are working on. AND fourth, if you need to rollback it is better to
do it if you have many hooks to choose from.

### Asking Why?

Children do it far more and they learn faster.. And if that other person
cannot explain, go and work where they really understand and love to
explain..

### Relationships are important

There is a direct connection to strength of your relationships and the
opportunities that will come your way. Invest in the people around you.
Do the right thing by people, even when it all goes wrong. Those people
are far much more likely to recommend you for your next job.

### Features and front end

Completing a feature will gain you kudos, and adding something that
clearly effects the customer experience will gain you support from those
that support customers and help the sales team. Having allies in all
camps will help you be more resilient (keep your job) in a downsizing
and will likely help with endorsements and recommendations. CEOs tend to
protect developers who produce more the observable changes i.e. new
button, skin, more responsive, etc. Where as the CTO will tend to
protect those who write good code and write good tests.

### Have Plan B, C and maybe a D

You are the bottom of the pile, when layoffs come, you are the first in
line. Protect yourself have a Plan B as this is very likely if you are
working at a real startup. Go to meet-ups, get to know your local
community, make connections with developers, so if you do get laid off,
you have people you can reach out to, so you can find your next
opportunity. Having an active blog of what you are learning helps you
reflect (so learn better) and you will build a following over time. Also
work on some projects that you can put out there, so they are public on
GitHub, if you feel comfortable to work on open source do.

### Should I be a developer?

You may ask yourself this sometimes. I certainly asked myself this at
times, when you may watch others craft so easily. This is often referred
to as the impostor complex, check out this railsconf talk.
[https://speakerdeck.com/nmeans/you-are-not-an-impostor](https://speakerdeck.com/nmeans/you-are-not-an-impostor).
Then I find myself, looking for an expression for fun, I find myself
impatient at not knowing, well everything, I dream about exploring other
code. Over time I found myself reading the source code rather then a
blog piece explaining it, I started to understand more and more code, I
find that I want to go back and refactor that hash search removing the
[:id] and put in a fetch(), because it fails loudly. I spend breakfasts
with other developers exploring what we know, what we have forgotten..
oh it appears I have the bug, no not the bad one but the one you are
bitten by… I notice it has being several days since I got stuck and had
to ask for help and instead I am asking for opinions. Do I know
everything no, can I find a solution, yes :-)

### If you are not from a Computer Science Background

You may lack in understanding of Algorithms, Data structures and do not
have one computer language down i.e. Ruby, Python, Java, or a C variant,
yet. You may want to create a growth plan for yourself to introduce
these. Over a year work out the things you want to be good at, there are
some good free course on https://www.coursera.org. It really depends on
how deep into the stack you need/want to go. If you are out of a
Bootcamp, consider building your understanding in the primary language
(e.g. Ruby, Python) and data structures first. Consider than basic
Algorithms, just the basic concepts, not the math and then play with a
functional language e.g. Erlang or Haskell. Learning a function language
will force to think in a very different way, but do this after you are
comfortable with a primary language.

### Side Projects

Every senior who I have spoken to says that they learned an incredible
amount from creating something they were curious about, maybe on a new
framework or connecting to an API. Some would just explore how one
GEM/package/library worked. This can also be helpful for building out
your GitHub profile. That said when you are doing some much other
homework this can be hard.

### Choosing the right company

**Medium/large company** There are some who think that a junior is
better off, going to a medium/large company. This approach essentially
states that these companies will have the processes to mentor/coach, a
bigger team to take on juniors. That said juniors have told me that
there options are often limited to be first a “customer success”, or QA,
or part of a front-end team and they have to work for a couple years
before being promoted to a full stack team. You will be able learn over
a period of time but may be limited to less important tasks.

**Agency/Code Shop** Another approach would be to work for a company
that will give you access to many codebases ( like an agency or a code
shop), thus you will learn very different things, different styles of
coding and architecture choices. This may lead to building lots of Apps
but only to a MVP level.

**Startup** Another approach would be to work for a Startup and then you
will get see all the code, and be responsible the whole stack. Thus you
end up be responsible for setting up the deploying to AWS which you may
not in larger companies who may have a Dev Ops person. You will have to
learn a lot more and faster. It is also likely you will make mistakes
through your journey. This journey would likely teach about one codebase
to a deeper level then the Agency approach.

*Do you have any tips?*

*I would suggest you blogging your own journey, it will help you
remember what it was like to be a junior and when you take juniors on
yourself you can help them with your blog post and also remember not to
be a**dick ;-)*

    Thanks of the sharing Eric… we could all add more humanity with how
    we offer feedback.

    Your article got me think about what happens to Senior Devs as they
    age… most are in their 30′s, soon will be in their 40′s and then one
    day they are 50.

    Perhaps we all return from where we began.

        I feel effective feedback is a pillar for good culture at work
        and for relationships both at work and home. I talked about in
        detail in a previous blog

    “Coding is hard, there are few professionals that demand you to know
    so many things, that are constantly changing”

    Aren’t there? I’ve not worked in other professional fields myself
    but my (limited) exposure to them suggests that they all require a
    depth of knowledge just as deep as programming.

    If you dropped me on a film shoot in Hollywood or a hotel kitchen in
    Miami, I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t have the first clue what anyone
    was talking about. Those aren’t even fields which require extensive
    post-graduate study, like medicine and law.

    Many thanks for this article. I’m thinking about stepping into the
    developer world this autumn and this post gave me some understanding
    of what it will be like and what to do to improve myself.

    Solid stuff. Thanks again.
