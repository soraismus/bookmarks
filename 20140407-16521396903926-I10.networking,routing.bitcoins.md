Cryptocurrencies will create a fifth protocol layer powering the next
generation of the Internet.

Humans don’t \*need\* math-based cryptocurrencies when dealing with
other humans. We walk slowly, talk slowly, and buy big things. Credit
cards, cash, wires, checks – the world seems fine.

Machines, on the other hand, are far chattier and quicker to exchange
information. The Four Layers of the [Internet Protocol
Suite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) are
constantly communicating. The Link Layer puts packets on a wire. The
Internet Layer routes them across networks. The Transport Layer persists
communication across a given conversation. And the Application Layer
delivers entire documents and applications.

This chatty, anonymous network treats resources as “too cheap to meter.”
It’s a giant grid that transfers data but doesn’t transfer value. DDoS
attacks, email spam, and flooded VPNs result. Names and identities are
controlled by overlords – ICANN, DNS Servers, Facebook, Twitter, and
Certificate “Authorities.”

Where’s the protocol layer for exchanging value, not just data? Where’s
the distributed, anonymous, permission-less system for chatty machines
to allocate their scarce resources? Where is the “virtual money” to
create this “virtual economy?”

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are already trustless – any machine can
accept it from any other, securely. They are (nearly) free. They are
global – no central bank required, and any machine can speak the
language. And they’re one to two steps from being
[quick](http://www.fastcoin.ca/), [anonymous](http://zerocoin.org/), and
capable of [authentication](https://www.namecoin.org/).

Suppose we had a QuickCoin, which cleared transactions nearly instantly,
anonymously, and for infinitesimal mining fees. It could use the Bitcoin
blockchain for security or for easy trading in and out. SMTP would
demand QuickCoin to weed out spam. Routers would exchange QuickCoin to
shut down DDoS attacks. Tor Gateways would demand Quickcoin to
anonymously route traffic. Machines would bypass centralized DNS and
OAuth servers, using Coins to establish ownership.

Why stop at one Coin? Let’s posit a dozen new Appcoins. Using
[application-specific
coins](http://startupboy.com/2014/03/09/the-bitcoin-model-for-crowdfunding/)
rewards the open-source developers with a pre-mined quantity. A TorCoin
can be paid to its developers and gateways and by Tor users, achieving
consensus via proof-of-bandwidth. We can allocate any scarce network
resource this way – i.e., BoxCoin for Storage, CacheCoin for Caching,
etc.

Lets move on to other networks. Can a completely distributed grid of
small generators trade power with each other, using a decentralized and
trustless cryptocurrency? Can a traffic jam of self-driving cars clear
itself as the computerized vehicles bid for right of way? Can a mass of
people crossing a street take priority over a single car waiting at the
traffic light, as their phones vote, trustlessly and reliably, for their
presence? Can we efficiently route networks of assets like water and
power, and liabilities like pollutants and sewage, across a distributed
grid? Can we trade stocks and financial assets with no brokers,
custodians, or agents?

Cryptocurrencies are electronic cash, and as such, will be used by
electronic agents to exchange value, verify contracts, and track
identity and reputation. All of a sudden, the computing resources spent
by the Bitcoin miners doesn’t seem wasted – it seems efficient, given
that it can be used for congestion control and routing of other network
resources.

Cryptocurrencies are an emergent property of the Internet – almost a
fifth protocol in the Internet suite. If Satoshi Nakomoto did not exist,
it would still be necessary to invent them. Someday, they will be used
by the machines in our network, on our desk, in our garage, and in our
pocket to exchange value and achieve consensus at blinding speeds,
anonymously, and at minimal cost.

When that day arrives, large distributed networks that we rely upon will
change. Starting with the Internet, they will become de-centralized
market economies, far more intelligent than they are today. Just as
human brains co-evolved with our ability to trade and exchange goods
with people who weren’t related to us, so the network will become more
intelligent as it learns to trade currency and contracts with unrelated
nodes.

Eventually, there will be no functioning Internet or Internet of Things
at the protocol layer without deep cryptocurrency integration. Turning
off this fifth protocol will be impossible. Cryptocurrencies also remain
mediums of exchange and stores of value. Nation states that are used to
imposing capital controls will face a quandary – ban cryptocurrencies,
and live in the technology dustbin. Enable them, and this virus, this
religion, this protocol – will enable the free flow of money and
language, along with packets, around the globe.

    it seems like we are inevitably heading in this direction Naval. but
    i’ve got a few questions. why is this the fifth layer and not
    another set of application layer protocols to supplement http, smtp,
    etc? and are each of these “coins and blockchains” yet another
    protocol or is there one protocol that implements all of them?

        You are correct in that it’s technically another set of
        application layer protocols – I was just being provocative with
        the title :-) Although in theory it could be a resource
        allocation layer on top of SMTP, HTTP, etc. Semantics…

        It’s likely one protocol in most cases except where needs
        conflict:\
         - Anonymity is desirable in some cases, undesirable in others\
         - Speed of confirmations vs security of confirmations\
         - Need to reward developers vs need to reward early adopters
        (Mastercoin v Bitcoin)\
         - Flexibility (Ethereum Turing Complete scripting language) vs
        Security (Bitcoin scripting)

        But really, I don’t know. I wrote this to get the conversation
        started so I could have others help me figure it out.

            I expect there will be multiple protocols that complement
            each other. Some will be better suited to specific use
            cases, just like programming languages. Not all will
            succeed.

            These protocols will be able to interact with each other
            since trusted oracles will provide data to bridge the gap.
            The Bitcoin blockchain (or a subset of it) is itself an
            oracle that could be published to other Blockchains i.e an
            Ethereum contract listens for a Mastercoin transaction to a
            specific address on the Bitcoin blockchain & execute
            accordingly.

            This will create new business models & likely be disruptive
            to many industries and systems. It can affect everything
            from the funding of major projects to post-trade activities,
            & even how the democratic process functions (use a unique
            vote coin to provide or remove backing from politicians at
            will?). It’s really just a case of how far it goes!

            Excellent piece Naval.

            It’s a bit of semantics and a lot of marketing, but I
            strongly suspect there will be a Fifth Layer. New protocols
            of this ilk are going to be very difficult to integrate into
            the stack, and are going to require massive new hardware
            processing power. It’s unlikely the major network players
            will move fast enough, as smart mining companies are way
            ahead. The startups are going to be dropping expensive new
            boxes in every datacenter handling the new protocols, and it
            will be in everyone’s best interest to call it a new layer:
            The startup guys are selling a new box and need to justify
            it against the 50 protocols the network hardware already
            handles, the CIOs need to justify a bunch of new hardware
            costs, and Cisco is going to spend so much acquiring the
            startups they’ll want to call it a new internet let alone a
            new layer.

            Meanwhile the engineers won’t really care to quibble about
            layer semantics since they’ll all have retired on their
            cryptocoins. And you thought it was hard to hire now.

            \*Note in the formal geek parlance the four “layers” are
            each comprised of multiple protocols, and there are way more
            than five. So the title should really be “The Fifth Layer”.
            The “The Fifth Protocol Layer” is passable but a bit
            flowery.

            Great stuff, very interesting to think about the future you
            describe – I’d just like to push back a bit on the apparent
            tradeoffs you present, though.

            \1. A cryptocurrency protocol can support anonymity,
            pseudo-anonymity, and non-anonymity at the same time. Think
            mixing services
            ([https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mixing\_service](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mixing_service)),
            stealth addresses
            ([https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Sx/Stealth](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Sx/Stealth)),
            etc.\
             2. The tradeoff between speed and security is not clear –
            it seems that it’s possible to have very fast transactions
            with an extremely high level of security. Check out this
            proposal to accelerate transaction processing using
            Heaviest-Observed Sub-Trees:
            [https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf).\
             3. I think that eventually a standard accepted
            cryptocurrency launch model will emerge. It seems like the
            community still disapproves of the Mastercoin and Ethereum
            launch strategies (we won’t even get into Nxt or Ripple).
            One coin tried having a certain percentage of mining fees
            automatically go to the developers, where the developers
            proclaim their addresses and the protocol votes to confirm
            those addresses. People still complain about these
            practices, but I think eventually something will become
            socially acceptable. The key is to avoid the words
            “pre-mine” or “insta-mine” and launch your coin fairly on
            Bitcoin Forum.\
             4. I completely agree here – there does seem to be a
            tradeoff between security and Turing Complete-ness.

            Just some things to think about. I think it’s quite possible
            to have a single coin serve several purposes at once, and
            the number of coins that we end up with might actually only
            be a handful.

            Also, the choice of a proof of work is always a challenge.
            How many different blockchains with different proofs of work
            can possibly coexist?

            Great discussion on how cryptocurrencies will change and/or
            work with the Internet stack and be core services
            themselves. Personally, I’m thinking about this a bit
            differently and would rather divide things into a) control
            plane and b) data plane. The current Internet stack does a
            great job for delivering data and can continue to do so.
            Crypto-currencies can/will provide a separate communication
            channel for “control” i.e., verification of identity, smart
            contracts, bidding on resources etc. Once the control
            channel (cryptocurrencies) establish what action needs to be
            taken, the data can be sent over the “dumb” Internet stack.

            The networking community is headed in the direction of a
            separation between the control and data plane anyway thanks
            to Nicira Networks and the Software Defined Networking (SDN)
            model.

            Ripple can already do this without using its own native
            currency.

            The reason why a crypto-currency is however useful for this
            task is that in that case no trust is required between the
            various parties transacting: each party immediately receives
            (and can immediately verify that they have received) the
            actual currency.

            If instead you were to use e.g. USD via Ripple you can only
            transact in USD IOUs so you have to trust whoever promises
            to redeem the IOU. With a cryptocurrency no such redemption
            and trust are necessary because you instantly receive the
            actual currency.

    In No-Limit hold’em, the size of your stack can be as important as
    the quality of your cards or skill.

    Machine-fast network activity may have extreme network effects,
    consolidating power and disenfranchising an awful lot.

    May be a good case for a CryptoCurrency equivalent of a Hayekian
    minimum income and automatic monopoly/oligoply prevention: Direct
    transfer of Cryptocurrency from accounts with over max% of overall
    pool to accounts with less than minimum%

    It seems like a bootstrapping problem to have what must be a higher
    layer protocol attempting to control the workings of lower layers.
    Essentially, to be a control channel, it would have to be out of
    band. At which point you’re just inventing a second, parallel
    internet to govern the first internet.

    Also, how is value determined automatically? My inner evil hacker is
    rubbing his hands together at the new possibilities for gaming the
    system.

    I suspect a lot of this is still mathematically fair game in terms
    of determining what exactly is possible, and what these
    implementations/protocols will look like. The same way we spent
    previous years systematizing a mapping method to translate apps
    designed for local compute/network/storage to the cloud, we now have
    the task of mapping centralized ‘cloud’ apps to decentralized
    ledger-based (dare-I-say ‘mist’?) apps. I suspect as work and
    infrastructure picks up, we’ll see a single emergent block chain
    (‘aws for block chains’ – etherium, Bitcoin w/ an extended
    protocol?) and a long tail of unique ledgers built for highly
    specific custom use cases..

        As centralized cloud infrastructure evolved, we saw a
        ‘greenfield’ opportunities emerge. I suspect this is what will
        happen with decentralized ledger based app as well – \*love\*
        the creativity here in arguing for a few potential such apps!

    This. Ledgers/blockchains need to be as cheap as git branches, so
    there can be a long tail of them.

        Take a look at “micropayment channels” – a technique for
        off-chain micropayments to be netted-out less frequently onto
        the global chain. There’s a variant in BitcoinJ and another by
        core dev Jeff Garzik linked/discussed at

    I believe the vision here points us towards right direction, but is
    not entirely correct. One major problem I see with cryptocurrencies
    is the creation of money by mining. This is straightforward in its’
    way and for some purposes serves perfectly fine. But this does not
    map so well to the money creation people might truly prefer. I see
    this mostly as an ethics and fairness problem. If compelling
    alternative with different money creation mechanism appears I
    believe many will choose that option instead (or alongside)
    cryptocurrencies.

    Platforms like classic Ripple tried to approach this problem from
    different perspective. They failed for good reasons and everyone
    moved their focus to bitcoin. I still believe there is a third
    option and I’m actively working to realize this vision.

    I’m first to admit that my knowledge of cryptocurrencies is mostly
    superficial, so please tell me why I’m wrong :)\
     If anyone is interested I have expanded on my arguments a bit in

    Not forgetting that Bitcoin isn’t at root a cryptocurrency, but a
    distributed ledger. Ledgers can be used for things other than money,
    e.g. Twister uses it for ensuring unique usernames, maybe
    distributed filesystems, etc. The key component of Bitcoin-alikes is
    the incentive for people to join the network.

    \> Can a completely distributed grid of small generators trade power
    with each other, using a decentralized and trustless
    cryptocurrency?\
     That is just a special case of trading any other goods or services
    with a cryptocurrency. There is no need to create a new currency
    just for this purpose. You only need to create a marketplace to
    trade power, and use an existing currency as the accounting tokens.
    Users on the reddit.com site created a “tip bot” to trade monetary
    tips for posting high quality comments. It used bitcoins as the
    accounting tokens, but tracked them internally as long as the tips
    stayed within reddit. Only when you withdrew your accumulated tips
    did it become a transaction on the bitcoin ledger. Keeping small
    transactions “off-chain” (the Block Chain) minimized transaction
    fees and allowed for faster clearing, at the expense of having to
    trust the tip bot.
