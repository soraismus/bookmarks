My favorite debugging tool
==========================

Hey ScalingPHPer,\
 \
 Last week, I was sitting on my couch, binging on some new episodes on
NetFlix.\
 \
 *\*Ding\**...*\*Ding\**\
 \
 A text message? This late? Can't be good.\
 \
 Grudgingly, I pause NetFlix after a few seconds ("*How it's made*" is
super addicting) to check out the messages...\
 \
 ***"From PagerDuty: Your API is Down!"***\
 \
 Fuck! An alert telling me that my site is down. EXCUSE ME! I'm over
here trying to learn how Nail Clippers are made. Damnit. Off to the
computer.\
 \
 I sit down and try to load up api.myjob.com and... nothing. Chrome just
sits there, the condescending little blue circle thing spinning into
oblivion.\
 \
 **My site is DOWN, and it's down hard. Requests are timing out.**\
 \
 What I do next might surprise you.. but first, a question—\
 \
 What tactics would you use? Some good answers might be...

-   Check out automated alerts, like ones sent from Nagios
-   Look at your alerting/graphing systems like Copperegg or Graphite
-   Verify the "usual suspects" like Memcache or MySQL are healthy

\
 But **that's NOT what I did**. Any guesses?\
 \
 I logged into one of my PHP servers, grabbed one of the PIDs for a
PHP-FPM worker, and ran "strace -p".

### **What?? Isn't strace a tool for hardcore unix neckbeards?**

HELL NO!\
 \
 If you're not using strace on a reocurring basis, you're doing yourself
a MAJOR disservice. It's perfect for quick and dirty debugging. Sure, in
an IDEAL world, you'd get a notification telling you exactly which
service was down, but I'm a realist and I know that doesn't always
happen.\
 \
 When your site is down, wishing you had better alerting isn't the
answer. You need to get your API back up ASAP. Everything else comes
second.

### strace is your cheat code

Strace is a free unix tool that comes with almost every linux distro out
there. You give Strace a PID (in my case, the PID of a PHP-FPM worker)
and it instantly hooks into the running process and tells you what
kernel system calls it's making. \
 \
 A system call is like a low-level function that your PHP code makes to
the operating system. Things like— "*read a file*" and "*connect to this
mysql server*" use system calls.\
 \
 It so happens that when your app is blocking and dead-in-the-water,
it's because your PHP code is waiting for a system call to respond.
Viola!\
 \
 So, I log into my webserver over SSH and run "ps" to grab a random
PHP-FPM process id, like this:\
 \
 $ ps aux | grep php-fpm\
 myapp **128131** 2.9 0.0 324132 57396 ? R 10:54 11:50 php-fpm: pool
www\
 ...\
 \
 See 128131? That's a process id I can get a sneak peak into using
strace.\
 \
 Next, I attach strace to the process and see what's up...\
 \
 $ sudo strace -p 128131\
 \
 gettimeofday({1399247077, 563898}, NULL) = 0\
 sendto(17, "\\372\\0\\0\\0\\3**SELECT \* FROM users WHERE id =**"...,
254, MSG\_DONTWAIT, NULL, 0) = 254\
 \
 I see it waiting on the last line for several seconds. Just, like that,
I can immediately see that it's sending a SQL query to the database
server and is waiting for the response.. looks like my database server
is foobared again!\
 \
 And just like magic, I'm immediately able to diagnose the downtime.
Strace gives me the power to address the database server faster, fix the
problem, and get back to watching "*How It's Made*".

### A good friend of mine is a scaling expert...

He's the kind of guy that can not only program well, but can also talk
for hours about hardcore linux internals. I asked him— \
 \
 "***If you could teach everyone just ONE thing about scaling... what
would it be?***"\
 \
 His response? Strace. 1000 times strace. Nothing else can give you so
much insight and information about your stack in a single command. You
can have all of the monitoring IN THE WORLD, and strace will STILL give
you new insights into your application.

### Brace yourself, free updates are coming

I have some free updates planned for [Scaling
PHP](http://scalingphpbook.com) in the coming weeks to cover some new
stuff in PHP 5.5 and 5.6. Some of that new content will be about
debugging at scale using strace :) \
 \
 P.S— If you live in the Bay Area, I'll be giving a talk called
"*Scaling LAMP doesn't have to suck!*" at \#SFPHP on May 13. [RSVP
Here](http://www.meetup.com/sf-php/events/171319602/). Hope you can make
it!
