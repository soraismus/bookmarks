This page gives brief, visual reference for the most common commands in
git. Once you know a bit about how git works, this site may solidify
your understanding. If you're interested in how this site was created,

Basic Usage
-----------

![image](basic-usage.svg.png)

The four commands above copy files between the working directory, the
stage (also called the index), and the history (in the form of commits).

-   `git add files` copies *files* (at their current state) to the
    stage.
-   `git commit` saves a snapshot of the stage as a commit.
-   `git reset -- files` unstages files; that is, it copies *files* from
    the latest commit to the stage. Use this command to "undo" a
    `git add files`. You can also `git reset` to unstage everything.
-   `git checkout -- files` copies *files* from the stage to the working
    directory. Use this to throw away local changes.

You can use `git reset -p`, `git checkout -p`, or `git add -p` instead
of (or in addition to) specifying particular files to interactively
choose which hunks copy.

It is also possible to jump over the stage and check out files directly
from the history or commit files without staging first.

![image](basic-usage-2.svg.png)

-   `git commit -a ` is equivalent to running `git add` on all filenames
    that existed in the latest commit, and then running `git commit`.
-   `git commit files` creates a new commit containing the contents of
    the latest commit, plus a snapshot of *files* taken from the working
    directory. Additionally, *files* are copied to the stage.
-   `git checkout HEAD -- files` copies *files* from the latest commit
    to both the stage and the working directory.

Conventions
-----------

In the rest of this document, we will use graphs of the following form.

![image](conventions.svg.png)

Commits are shown in green as 5-character IDs, and they point to their
parents. Branches are shown in orange, and they point to particular
commits. The current branch is identified by the special reference
*HEAD*, which is "attached" to that branch. In this image, the five
latest commits are shown, with *ed489* being the most recent. *master*
(the current branch) points to this commit, while *maint* (another
branch) points to an ancestor of *master*'s commit.

Commands in Detail
------------------

### Diff

There are various ways to look at differences between commits. Below are
some common examples. Any of these commands can optionally take extra
filename arguments that limit the differences to the named files.

![image](diff.svg.png)

### Commit

When you commit, git creates a new commit object using the files from
the stage and sets the parent to the current commit. It then points the
current branch to this new commit. In the image below, the current
branch is *master*. Before the command was run, *master* pointed to
*ed489*. Afterward, a new commit, *f0cec*, was created, with parent
*ed489*, and then *master* was moved to the new commit.

![image](commit-master.svg.png)

This same process happens even when the current branch is an ancestor of
another. Below, a commit occurs on branch *maint*, which was an ancestor
of *master*, resulting in *1800b*. Afterward, *maint* is no longer an
ancestor of *master*. To join the two histories, a [merge](#merge) (or
[rebase](#rebase)) will be necessary.

![image](commit-maint.svg.png)

Sometimes a mistake is made in a commit, but this is easy to correct
with `git commit --amend`. When you use this command, git creates a new
commit with the same parent as the current commit. (The old commit will
be discarded if nothing else references it.)

![image](commit-amend.svg.png)

A fourth case is committing with a [detached HEAD](#detached), as
explained later.

### Checkout

The checkout command is used to copy files from the history (or stage)
to the working directory, and to optionally switch branches.

When a filename (and/or `-p`) is given, git copies those files from the
given commit to the stage and the working directory. For example,
`git checkout HEAD~ foo.c` copies the file `foo.c` from the commit
called *HEAD\~* (the parent of the current commit) to the working
directory, and also stages it. (If no commit name is given, files are
copied from the stage.) Note that the current branch is not changed.

![image](checkout-files.svg.png)

When a filename is *not* given but the reference is a (local) branch,
*HEAD* is moved to that branch (that is, we "switch to" that branch),
and then the stage and working directory are set to match the contents
of that commit. Any file that exists in the new commit (*a47c3* below)
is copied; any file that exists in the old commit (*ed489*) but not in
the new one is deleted; and any file that exists in neither is ignored.

![image](checkout-branch.svg.png)

When a filename is *not* given and the reference is *not* a (local)
branch — say, it is a tag, a remote branch, a SHA-1 ID, or something
like *master\~3* — we get an anonymous branch, called a *detached HEAD*.
This is useful for jumping around the history. Say you want to compile
version 1.6.6.1 of git. You can `git checkout     v1.6.6.1` (which is a
tag, not a branch), compile, install, and then switch back to another
branch, say `git checkout master`. However, committing works slightly
differently with a detached HEAD; this is covered [below](#detached).

![image](checkout-detached.svg.png)

### Committing with a Detached HEAD

When *HEAD* is detached, commits work like normal, except no named
branch gets updated. (You can think of this as an anonymous branch.)

![image](commit-detached.svg.png)

Once you check out something else, say *master*, the commit is
(presumably) no longer referenced by anything else, and gets lost. Note
that after the command, there is nothing referencing *2eecb*.

![image](checkout-after-detached.svg.png)

If, on the other hand, you want to save this state, you can create a new
named branch using `git checkout -b name`.

![image](checkout-b-detached.svg.png)

### Reset

The reset command moves the current branch to another position, and
optionally updates the stage and the working directory. It also is used
to copy files from the history to the stage without touching the working
directory.

If a commit is given with no filenames, the current branch is moved to
that commit, and then the stage is updated to match this commit. If
`--hard` is given, the working directory is also updated. If `--soft` is
given, neither is updated.

![image](reset-commit.svg.png)

If a commit is not given, it defaults to *HEAD*. In this case, the
branch is not moved, but the stage (and optionally the working
directory, if `--hard` is given) are reset to the contents of the last
commit.

![image](reset.svg.png)

If a filename (and/or `-p`) is given, then the command works similarly
to [checkout](#checkout) with a filename, except only the stage (and not
the working directory) is updated. (You may also specify the commit from
which to take files, rather than *HEAD*.)

![image](reset-files.svg.png)

### Merge

A merge creates a new commit that incorporates changes from other
commits. Before merging, the stage must match the current commit. The
trivial case is if the other commit is an ancestor of the current
commit, in which case nothing is done. The next most simple is if the
current commit is an ancestor of the other commit. This results in a
*fast-forward* merge. The reference is simply moved, and then the new
commit is checked out.

![image](merge-ff.svg.png)

Otherwise, a "real" merge must occur. You can choose other strategies,
but the default is to perform a "recursive" merge, which basically takes
the current commit (*ed489* below), the other commit (*33104*), and
their common ancestor (*b325c*), and performs a [three-way
merge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-way_merge). The result is
saved to the working directory and the stage, and then a commit occurs,
with an extra parent (*33104*) for the new commit.

![image](merge.svg.png)

### Cherry Pick

The cherry-pick command "copies" a commit, creating a new commit on the
current branch with the same message and patch as another commit.

![image](cherry-pick.svg.png)

### Rebase

A rebase is an alternative to a [merge](#merge) for combining multiple
branches. Whereas a merge creates a single commit with two parents,
leaving a non-linear history, a rebase replays the commits from the
current branch onto another, leaving a linear history. In essence, this
is an automated way of performing several [cherry-pick](#cherry-pick)s
in a row.

![image](rebase.svg.png)

The above command takes all the commits that exist in *topic* but not in
*master* (namely *169a6* and *2c33a*), replays them onto *master*, and
then moves the branch head to the new tip. Note that the old commits
will be garbage collected if they are no longer referenced.

To limit how far back to go, use the `--onto` option. The following
command replays onto *master* the most recent commits on the current
branch since *169a6* (exclusive), namely *2c33a*.

![image](rebase-onto.svg.png)

There is also `git rebase --interactive`, which allows one to do more
complicated things than simply replaying commits, namely dropping,
reordering, modifying, and squashing commits. There is no obvious
picture to draw for this; see
[git-rebase(1)](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html#_interactive_mode)
for more details.

Technical Notes
---------------

The contents of files are not actually stored in the index
(*.git/index*) or in commit objects. Rather, each file is stored in the
object database (*.git/objects*) as a *blob*, identified by its SHA-1
hash. The index file lists the filenames along with the identifier of
the associated blob, as well as some other data. For commits, there is
an additional data type, a *tree*, also identified by its hash. Trees
correspond to directories in the working directory, and contain a list
of trees and blobs corresponding to each filename within that directory.
Each commit stores the identifier of its top-level tree, which in turn
contains all of the blobs and other trees associated with that commit.

If you make a commit using a detached HEAD, the last commit really is
referenced by something: the reflog for HEAD. However, this will expire
after a while, so the commit will eventually be garbage collected,
similar to commits discarded with `git commit --amend` or
`git     rebase`.
