[Zurb Foundation vs Twitter Bootstrap for non-designers [closed]](/questions/17047454/zurb-foundation-vs-twitter-bootstrap-for-non-designers)

I'm not a web designer, and I don't have a lot of time for
customization. I'm creating a website that is a LoB web application.
Most users will be using IE 9 on the desktop, but a few responsive pages
will be required for some iPad/iPhone access in the field.

Can someone give me some reasons for and against choosing Foundation or
Bootstrap for use with ASP.NET Web Forms in Visual Studio 2012?

If you want something that works well out of the box, I think bootstrap
is a better solution. Many rails developers just use the plain bootstrap
for their apps. Also bootstrap seems to have a larger installed base and
a larger community surrounding it.

If you want to get further into the design, take a mobile first approach
or prefer scss/sass over less, or want to highly optimize your front end
assets especially for mobile (zepto vs jquery, interchange responsive
images, etc.) Foundation would be a better solution imo.

Both provide a very simular set of functionality, although there are
some slight differences.

Both provide a somewhat opinionated design out of the box. A lot of
people say sites look bootstapy or foundationy. This is usually because
there is very littile customization done.

If one is more what you are going for, that could be the ideal solution.
If you go to the main site for each, you will get a pretty good idea of
what that design style is.
