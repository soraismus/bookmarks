A $15 Million Space Race For Education

A rural tribe is living peacefully in the Kalahari desert, free of
contact with the modern world. One day, a Coke bottle drops from the
sky, fallen from a passing airplane.

The villagers find many uses for this unfamiliar new technology: a
firestarter, a musical instrument, a stamp for printing on cloth. But
because of its very uniqueness, they start to fight over it, and one of
the villagers decides that to preserve harmony, it's best to return this
"gift" to the gods.

"The Gods Must Be Crazy," a South African comedy, was a global smash hit
in the early 1980s. It's only in the past decade, though, that its plot
— or at least, the setup — has been adapted as a playbook for
transforming education.

The idea: Some previously unknown technology could, all by itself,
catalyze a revolution in children's learning, especially in the
developing world.

“ "You're looking at a model that has arguably failed many, many, many
kids. We're not in the business of looking back."

- Matt Keller, Global XPrize for Education

The latest incarnation of this idea was announced this week. The $15
million [Global Learning
XPRIZE](http://www.xprize.org/grand-challenges/learning) is being billed
as the largest-ever technology competition in the private sector, to
"revolutionize global education."

XPRIZE is a nonprofit organization led by tech entrepreneur Peter
Diamandis. Previous XPRIZE contests produced the world's first private
space flight, a new method for [cleaning up oil spills in the
ocean](http://www.npr.org/2011/10/19/141481055/revolutionary-oil-skimmer-nets-1-million-x-prize),
and a [hyperefficient 100 mile-per-gallon
car.](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128652416)

The winning team of the Global Learning XPRIZE, organizers say, will
"develop a free, open-source and scalable software solution in 18 months
that can enable children to teach themselves basic reading, writing and
arithmetic." The software, says the challenge's director Matt Keller,
will be designed to be deployed on very low-cost Android tablet
computers.

**The Reading Project**

Keller explains that the idea emerged from his previous work with the
One Laptop Per Child project. Announced in 2005 by Nicholas Negroponte
of the MIT Media Lab, One Laptop Per Child has distributed [over 2.4
million](http://one.laptop.org/map) of its specially designed "XO"
laptops and tablets around the world.

While the majority of these have gone to school systems, Negroponte and
Keller ran a side experiment called [The Reading
Project,](http://blog.laptop.org/tag/reading-project/) where
solar-powered computers with literacy apps were distributed directly to
children in remote areas of Ethiopia. The children were given no
instruction in how to use them.

The initial experimental sites chosen were villages with no schools, no
libraries, no printed material, even without road signs. "We tested the
supposition that kids could teach each other how to read," Keller says.
"The theory was, if you had the right kind of application and design for
self learning, you could conceivably see a breakthrough."

Maryanne Wolf, a professor of child development at Tufts University, has
been researching the outcomes of the project, now called the [Global
Literacy Project,](globallit.org)with sites in Uganda and the rural
American South. She says that while the children haven't learned to
read, they have learned the English alphabet from the tablets alone.
"Our data serves as a kind of germinating first round of evidence that
this approach can really help many children," she says.

The Global Learning XPRIZE grows from this seed. According to the press
release for the XPRIZE, it aims to prove "that through technology a
child can learn *autonomously.*"

Keller says this is important because an estimated 250 million children
around the world lack basic literacy, and 58 million are not in school.
Schools are overcrowded and teachers are undertrained.

"I did a lot of work in Afghanistan," he says. "Teachers there are often
just one grade more educated than the kids, and sometimes they're not
literate at all."

But why not just spend the money to train teachers or build schools?

"Even just to get the kids that are out of school into school, you need
to train three million more teachers and build 1.1 million more schools,
which is going to take a really long time," Keller says. "You can say
you're looking at a model that has arguably failed many, many, many
kids. We're not in the business of looking back."

He says the time is ripe to "gamble" on new approaches.

**No Girls Allowed**

Payal Arora is not so sure. A media and communication professor at the
Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication in the Netherlands,
she has studied a similar attempt at technologically driven
self-learning, the Hole in the Wall project in India.

Started by Sugata Mitra, [Hole in the
Wall](http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/)simply places computers with an
Internet connection in locations where they will be accessible by
children. Mitra's concept of "minimally invasive education" won the 2013
TED Prize, given to a "visionary leader" with a "high-impact wish for
the world."

Most of the [positive
research](http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/Findings.html) on Hole in the
Wall comes from Mitra himself and his collaborators. There are reports
of children acquiring basic computer literacy and researching topics
like genetics.

Arora visited [a few such
sites](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01078.x/abstract)
in the Himalayas, and found very different results. "The two most
popular things are porn and video games," she says. "The boys download
them and take over. It becomes a male domain, and daughters don't want
to go there."

Mitra has [responded
publicly](http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/sugata-mitra-slum-chic-7-reasons-for.html)
to Arora's claims, calling them "armchair debate."

Arora says the Global X Prize, like Hole in the Wall and One Laptop Per
Child, represent not an evidence-based approach but an ideology: the
belief that "Human resources are so deeply flawed that investments in
technological resources will be much more effective."

But in reality, she argues, "learning is never 100 percent
self-directed. Of course we want children to be agents of their own
learning, but no one in their right mind would say let's get rid of
human input, from parents, schools, or communities."

Arora says that before we continue to sway resources toward a quick
technological fix, she'd like to see "substantive evidence that
self-directed learning autonomous from human mediators can be a
standalone tool."

Keller says his prize, if it works as designed, will generate exactly
that evidence.

Unlike previous XPRIZE challenges, the final phase will be a controlled
trial. Applications developed by the five finalist teams will be
distributed to a few thousand children in West Africa, and the program
deemed most effective at raising the kids' basic literacy and math
scores from a baseline will be called the winner.

"We don't know if this is going to work," he says. "But if it does, it's
transformative, and why not try?"
