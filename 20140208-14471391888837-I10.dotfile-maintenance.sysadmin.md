==================

*Your unofficial guide to dotfiles on GitHub.*

GitHub ❤ `~/`
=============

Why would I want my dotfiles on GitHub?

-   ***Backup***, ***restore***, and ***sync*** the prefs and settings
    for your toolbox. Your dotfiles might be the most important files on
    your machine.
-   ***Learn*** from the community. Discover new tools for your toolbox
    and new tricks for the ones you already use.
-   ***Share*** what you've learned with the rest of us.

Get started with a bootstrap
----------------------------

If you're just starting out, before you go symlinking everything in
`~/*`, you may want to check out a few bootstrap projects that take the
heavy lifting out of the process. Here are a few of our favorites:

-   [Zach Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)
    features topical organization, auto sourcing Zsh files, easy Zsh
    completion extensions, and a local bin folder for executables. The
    included `Rakefile` will symlink anything ending in `.symlink` to
    your `~` folder.
-   [Mathias Bynens'
    dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) includes a
    bootstrap script that rsyncs your repo to your home folder. Mathias'
    [OS X defaults
    script](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx)
    is legendary.
-   [Yan Pritzker's dotfiles](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) bundles
    an opinionated set of Vim plugins and Zsh setup all tuned for using
    [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) on OS X.
-   [Josh Nichols'
    Homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) makes it
    easy to symlink and clone dotfiles repos.
-   [Anders Ingemann's homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick)
    is like Homesick but in bash.
-   [Ben Alman's dotfiles](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles) support
    different configurations per OS, linking, copying and environment
    setup.
-   [Paul Miller’s dotfiles](https://github.com/paulmillr/dotfiles)
    feature greatly customized zsh with auto-completion and syntax
    highlighting, a bunch of useful git extras and colourful themes for
    OS X Terminal and Sublime Text 2.
-   [Eduardo Lundgren's
    dotfiles](https://github.com/eduardolundgren/dotfiles), the first
    JavaScript-based dotfiles powered by Grunt.

Go farther with a framework
---------------------------

For a lot of us, a big chunk of our `~` folder is devoted to our shell
and our text editor. Until you're ready to roll your own setup, these
projects make customization safe and easy.

-   [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is a
    community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration. It
    bundles 40+ plugins and 80+ themes.
-   [bash-it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it) is a "shameless ripoff
    of oh-my-zsh," but for bash.
-   [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) is a distribution of
    plug-ins and mappings for Vim, Gvim and MacVim.
-   [Brandon Philip's ghar](https://github.com/philips/ghar) is a
    standalone Python script for managing git repos symlinked into your
    home.
-   [Ben Alman's dotfiles](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles) support
    different configurations per OS, linking, copying and environment
    setup.
-   [fresh](https://github.com/freshshell/fresh) is a tool to source
    dotfiles from others into your own. It supports shell configuration
    (aliases, functions, etc.) as well as config files (e.g. `ackrc` and
    `gitconfig`). Think of it as *Bundler for your dotfiles*.
-   Richard "RichiH" Hartmann's [vcsh](https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh)
    manages all your dotfiles in Git without the need for symlinks. Any
    number of Git repositories will co-exist in parallel in your `$HOME`
    without interferring with each other. Advanced use cases with
    different branches for different systems are supported by default.
    An extensive hook system lets you customize your repositories.
    `vcsh` includes batch push, pull, and status commands which operate
    on all your repositories at once.

Don't ignore your `.gitignore`
------------------------------

GitHub has a [great collection of `.gitignore`
templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore) for a wide range of
languages and editors. We recommend [Simon Whitaker's shell
script](https://github.com/simonwhitaker/gitignore-boilerplates) to help
you manage them.

Embrace submodules
------------------

Consider using [Git submodules](http://help.github.com/submodules/) as
you start to add 3^rd^ party frameworks, scripts, and plugins.
Submodules make managing dotfile dependencies with so much easier.

FAQ
---

### Why create this site?

Some of your [fellow GitHub friends](http://github.com/dotfiles) have
found incredible value in digging through Other People's Dotfiles (OPD).
We aim to share that knowledge with you, our fellow wayfaring stranger
in the shell.

### You totally need to know about a great bootstrap or framework, how do I submit?

Great! We're always looking for new projects to follow. Please [connect
with us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/octodots).

### Oh no! I've committed passwords/API keys/other sensitive data!

We've got you covered! Take a look at the [sensitive data removal
guide](http://help.github.com/remove-sensitive-data).

### Your FAQ is weak. It *so* did not answer my question.

That's not a question. But feel free to [ask us anything on
Twitter](http://twitter.com/octodots). Maybe we can expand this list.
