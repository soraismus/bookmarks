My questions is how do I create this relationship within my model?

There is *logically* nothing wrong with your proposed solution. However,
you probably need to do something like this:

    belongs_to :parent, class_name: "Product", foreign_key: "parent_id"
    has_many :children, class_name: "Product", foreign_key: "parent_id"

You are basically storing a "tree", with one product at the top and
branches of child products underneath, potentially many levels deep.

The strategy in your example is known as an [Adjacency
List](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list). It is easy to find
the direct parent and direct descendants of any given record. However,
getting ALL the descendants (including descendants of descendants) can
be difficult, and gets more difficult the deeper the tree is.

An alternative often used is a [Nested
Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model), where each record
stores information about the object to the "left" and "right" of it.
This allows you to build a tree, no matter how big, pretty quickly (or
at least efficiently, in a single query). However, it is more
complicated and inserting a record usually means having to recalculate
and update **all** records to the right of the record you inserted.

A third option (and arguably a sort of middle-ground) is using [Path
Enumeration](http://onlamp.com/onlamp/2004/08/05/hierarchical_sql.html),
where objects store their entire path in the tree. So, given a tree like
this:

      A
     / \
    B   C
        |
        D

`A` would have a blank path (no parent), `B` and `C` would have the path
`A`, `D` would have the path `A/C`. Most insert operations are
relatively inexpensive with this solution, and querying is pretty easy.
However, its still rather complex and moving objects around in the tree
can get expensive.

There are other options, too, like [Closure
Tables](http://www.slideshare.net/billkarwin/sql-antipatterns-strike-back).

However, if a simple Adjacency List works for your needs then go with
that. It is definitely the simplest and easiest to understand. There are
gems that implement nested sets, and maybe for some other tree patterns
too, so you don't have to do all the heavy lifting yourself if you go
that route.

[This answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11162888/638425) can be handy
when implementing the Closure Tables pattern. –
