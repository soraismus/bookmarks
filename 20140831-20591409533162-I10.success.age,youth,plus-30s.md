SCARFE

Ben Fountain was an associate in the real-estate practice at the Dallas
offices of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, just a few years out of
law school, when he decided he wanted to write fiction. The only thing
Fountain had ever published was a law-review article. His literary
training consisted of a handful of creative-writing classes in college.
He had tried to write when he came home at night from work, but usually
he was too tired to do much. He decided to quit his job.

“I was tremendously apprehensive,” Fountain recalls. “I felt like I’d
stepped off a cliff and I didn’t know if the parachute was going to
open. Nobody wants to waste their life, and I was doing well at the
practice of law. I could have had a good career. And my parents were
very proud of me—my dad was so proud of me. . . . It was crazy.”

He began his new life on a February morning—a Monday. He sat down at his
kitchen table at 7:30 A.M. He made a plan. Every day, he would write
until lunchtime. Then he would lie down on the floor for twenty minutes
to rest his mind. Then he would return to work for a few more hours. He
was a lawyer. He had discipline. “I figured out very early on that if I
didn’t get my writing done I felt terrible. So I always got my writing
done. I treated it like a job. I did not procrastinate.” His first story
was about a stockbroker who uses inside information and crosses a moral
line. It was sixty pages long and took him three months to write. When
he finished that story, he went back to work and wrote another—and then
another.

In his first year, Fountain sold two stories. He gained confidence. He
wrote a novel. He decided it wasn’t very good, and he ended up putting
it in a drawer. Then came what he describes as his dark period, when he
adjusted his expectations and started again. He got a short story
published in *Harper’s.* A New York literary agent saw it and signed him
up. He put together a collection of short stories titled “Brief
Encounters with Che Guevara,” and Ecco, a HarperCollins imprint,
published it. The reviews were sensational. The *Times Book
Review*called it “heartbreaking.” It won the Hemingway Foundation/PEN
award. It was named a No. 1 Book Sense Pick. It made major regional
best-seller lists, was named one of the best books of the year by the
San Francisco *Chronicle*, the Chicago *Tribune*, and *Kirkus Reviews,*
and drew comparisons to Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, Robert Stone, and
John le Carré.

Ben Fountain’s rise sounds like a familiar story: the young man from the
provinces suddenly takes the literary world by storm. But Ben Fountain’s
success was far from sudden. He quit his job at Akin, Gump in 1988. For
every story he published in those early years, he had at least thirty
rejections. The novel that he put away in a drawer took him four years.
The dark period lasted for the entire second half of the
nineteen-nineties. His breakthrough with “Brief Encounters” came in
2006, eighteen years after he first sat down to write at his kitchen
table. The “young” writer from the provinces took the literary world by
storm at the age of forty-eight.

Genius, in the popular conception, is inextricably tied up with
precocity—doing something truly creative, we’re inclined to think,
requires the freshness and exuberance and energy of youth. Orson Welles
made his masterpiece, “Citizen Kane,” at twenty-five. Herman Melville
wrote a book a year through his late twenties, culminating, at age
thirty-two, with “Moby-Dick.” Mozart wrote his breakthrough Piano
Concerto No. 9 in E-Flat-Major at the age of twenty-one. In some
creative forms, like lyric poetry, the importance of precocity has
hardened into an iron law. How old was T. S. Eliot when he wrote “The
Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” (“I grow old . . . I grow old”)?
Twenty-three. “Poets peak young,” the creativity researcher James
Kaufman maintains. Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, the author of “Flow,”
agrees: “The most creative lyric verse is believed to be that written by
the young.” According to the Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner, a
leading authority on creativity, “Lyric poetry is a domain where talent
is discovered early, burns brightly, and then peters out at an early
age.”

A few years ago, an economist at the University of Chicago named David
Galenson decided to find out whether this assumption about creativity
was true. He looked through forty-seven major poetry anthologies
published since 1980 and counted the poems that appear most frequently.
Some people, of course, would quarrel with the notion that literary
merit can be quantified. But Galenson simply wanted to poll a broad
cross-section of literary scholars about which poems they felt were the
most important in the American canon. The top eleven are, in order, T.
S. Eliot’s “Prufrock,” Robert Lowell’s “Skunk Hour,” Robert Frost’s
“Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” William Carlos Williams’s “Red
Wheelbarrow,” Elizabeth Bishop’s “The Fish,” Ezra Pound’s “The River
Merchant’s Wife,” Sylvia Plath’s “Daddy,” Pound’s “In a Station of the
Metro,” Frost’s “Mending Wall,” Wallace Stevens’s “The Snow Man,” and
Williams’s “The Dance.” Those eleven were composed at the ages of
twenty-three, forty-one, forty-eight, forty, twenty-nine, thirty,
thirty, twenty-eight, thirty-eight, forty-two, and fifty-nine,
respectively. There is no evidence, Galenson concluded, for the notion
that lyric poetry is a young person’s game. Some poets do their best
work at the beginning of their careers. Others do their best work
decades later. Forty-two per cent of Frost’s anthologized poems were
written after the age of fifty. For Williams, it’s forty-four per cent.
For Stevens, it’s forty-nine per cent.

The same was true of film, Galenson points out in his study “Old Masters
and Young Geniuses: The Two Life Cycles of Artistic Creativity.” Yes,
there was Orson Welles, peaking as a director at twenty-five. But then
there was Alfred Hitchcock, who made “Dial M for Murder,” “Rear Window,”
“To Catch a Thief,” “The Trouble with Harry,” “Vertigo,” “North by
Northwest,” and “Psycho”—one of the greatest runs by a director in
history—between his fifty-fourth and sixty-first birthdays. Mark Twain
published “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” at forty-nine. Daniel Defoe
wrote “Robinson Crusoe” at fifty-eight.

The examples that Galenson could not get out of his head, however, were
Picasso and Cézanne. He was an art lover, and he knew their stories
well. Picasso was the incandescent prodigy. His career as a serious
artist began with a masterpiece, “Evocation: The Burial of Casagemas,”
produced at age twenty. In short order, he painted many of the greatest
works of his career—including “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon,” at the age of
twenty-six. Picasso fit our usual ideas about genius perfectly.

Cézanne didn’t. If you go to the Cézanne room at the Musée d’Orsay, in
Paris—the finest collection of Cézannes in the world—the array of
masterpieces you’ll find along the back wall were all painted at the end
of his career. Galenson did a simple economic analysis, tabulating the
prices paid at auction for paintings by Picasso and Cézanne with the
ages at which they created those works. A painting done by Picasso in
his mid-twenties was worth, he found, an average of four times as much
as a painting done in his sixties. For Cézanne, the opposite was true.
The paintings he created in his mid-sixties were valued fifteen times as
highly as the paintings he created as a young man. The freshness,
exuberance, and energy of youth did little for Cézanne. He was a late
bloomer—and for some reason in our accounting of genius and creativity
we have forgotten to make sense of the Cézannes of the world.

The first day that Ben Fountain sat down to write at his kitchen table
went well. He knew how the story about the stockbroker was supposed to
start. But the second day, he says, he “completely freaked out.” He
didn’t know how to describe things. He felt as if he were back in first
grade. He didn’t have a fully formed vision, waiting to be emptied onto
the page. “I had to create a mental image of a building, a room, a
façade, haircut, clothes—just really basic things,” he says. “I realized
I didn’t have the facility to put those into words. I started going out
and buying visual dictionaries, architectural dictionaries, and going to
school on those.”

He began to collect articles about things he was interested in, and
before long he realized that he had developed a fascination with Haiti.
“The Haiti file just kept getting bigger and bigger,” Fountain says.
“And I thought, O.K., here’s my novel. For a month or two I said I
really don’t need to go there, I can imagine everything. But after a
couple of months I thought, Yeah, you’ve got to go there, and so I went,
in April or May of ’91.”

He spoke little French, let alone Haitian Creole. He had never been
abroad. Nor did he know anyone in Haiti. “I got to the hotel, walked up
the stairs, and there was this guy standing at the top of the stairs,”
Fountain recalls. “He said, ‘My name is Pierre. You need a guide.’ I
said, ‘You’re sure as hell right, I do.’ He was a very genuine person,
and he realized pretty quickly I didn’t want to go see the girls, I
didn’t want drugs, I didn’t want any of that other stuff,” Fountain went
on. “And then it was, *boom*, ‘I can take you there. I can take you to
this person.’ ”

Fountain was riveted by Haiti. “It’s like a laboratory, almost,” he
says. “Everything that’s gone on in the last five hundred
years—colonialism, race, power, politics, ecological disasters—it’s all
there in very concentrated form. And also I just felt, viscerally,
pretty comfortable there.” He made more trips to Haiti, sometimes for a
week, sometimes for two weeks. He made friends. He invited them to visit
him in Dallas. (“You haven’t lived until you’ve had Haitians stay in
your house,” Fountain says.) “I mean, I was involved. I couldn’t just
walk away. There’s this very nonrational, nonlinear part of the whole
process. I had a pretty specific time era that I was writing about, and
certain things that I needed to know. But there were other things I
didn’t really need to know. I met a fellow who was with Save the
Children, and he was on the Central Plateau, which takes about twelve
hours to get to on a bus, and I had no reason to go there. But I went up
there. Suffered on that bus, and ate dust. It was a hard trip, but it
was a glorious trip. It had nothing to do with the book, but it wasn’t
wasted knowledge.”

In “Brief Encounters with Che Guevara,” four of the stories are about
Haiti, and they are the strongest in the collection. They feel like
Haiti; they feel as if they’ve been written from the inside looking out,
not the outside looking in. “After the novel was done, I don’t know, I
just felt like there was more for me, and I could keep going, keep going
deeper there,” Fountain recalls. “Always there’s something—always
something—here for me. How many times have I been? At least thirty
times.”

Prodigies like Picasso, Galenson argues, rarely engage in that kind of
open-ended exploration. They tend to be “conceptual,” Galenson says, in
the sense that they start with a clear idea of where they want to go,
and then they execute it. “I can hardly understand the importance given
to the word ‘research,’ ” Picasso once said in an interview with the
artist Marius de Zayas. “In my opinion, to search means nothing in
painting. To find is the thing.” He continued, “The several manners I
have used in my art must not be considered as an evolution or as steps
toward an unknown ideal of painting. . . . I have never made trials or
experiments.”

But late bloomers, Galenson says, tend to work the other way around.
Their approach is experimental. “Their goals are imprecise, so their
procedure is tentative and incremental,” Galenson writes in “Old Masters
and Young Geniuses,” and he goes on:

> The imprecision of their goals means that these artists rarely feel
> they have succeeded, and their careers are consequently often
> dominated by the pursuit of a single objective. These artists repeat
> themselves, painting the same subject many times, and gradually
> changing its treatment in an experimental process of trial and error.
> Each work leads to the next, and none is generally privileged over
> others, so experimental painters rarely make specific preparatory
> sketches or plans for a painting. They consider the production of a
> painting as a process of searching, in which they aim to discover the
> image in the course of making it; they typically believe that learning
> is a more important goal than making finished paintings. Experimental
> artists build their skills gradually over the course of their careers,
> improving their work slowly over long periods. These artists are
> perfectionists and are typically plagued by frustration at their
> inability to achieve their goal.

Where Picasso wanted to find, not search, Cézanne said the opposite: “I
seek in painting.”

An experimental innovator *would* go back to Haiti thirty times. That’s
how that kind of mind figures out what it wants to do. When Cézanne was
painting a portrait of the critic Gustave Geffroy, he made him endure
eighty sittings, over three months, before announcing the project a
failure. (The result is one of that string of masterpieces in the Musée
d’Orsay.) When Cézanne painted his dealer, Ambrose Vollard, he made
Vollard arrive at eight in the morning and sit on a rickety platform
until eleven-thirty, without a break, on a hundred and fifty
occasions—before abandoning the portrait. He would paint a scene, then
repaint it, then paint it again. He was notorious for slashing his
canvases to pieces in fits of frustration.

Mark Twain was the same way. Galenson quotes the literary critic
Franklin Rogers on Twain’s trial-and-error method: “His routine
procedure seems to have been to start a novel with some structural plan
which ordinarily soon proved defective, whereupon he would cast about
for a new plot which would overcome the difficulty, rewrite what he had
already written, and then push on until some new defect forced him to
repeat the process once again.” Twain fiddled and despaired and revised
and gave up on “Huckleberry Finn” so many times that the book took him
nearly a decade to complete. The Cézannes of the world bloom late not as
a result of some defect in character, or distraction, or lack of
ambition, but because the kind of creativity that proceeds through trial
and error necessarily takes a long time to come to fruition.

One of the best stories in “Brief Encounters” is called “Near-Extinct
Birds of the Central Cordillera.” It’s about an ornithologist taken
hostage by the FARC guerrillas of Colombia. Like so much of Fountain’s
work, it reads with an easy grace. But there was nothing easy or
graceful about its creation. “I struggled with that story,” Fountain
says. “I always try to do too much. I mean, I probably wrote five
hundred pages of it in various incarnations.” Fountain is at work right
now on a novel. It was supposed to come out this year. It’s late.

Galenson’s idea that creativity can be divided into these
types—conceptual and experimental—has a number of important
implications. For example, we sometimes think of late bloomers as late
starters. They don’t realize they’re good at something until they’re
fifty, so of course they achieve late in life. But that’s not quite
right. Cézanne was painting almost as early as Picasso was. We also
sometimes think of them as artists who are *discovered* late; the world
is just slow to appreciate their gifts. In both cases, the assumption is
that the prodigy and the late bloomer are fundamentally the same, and
that late blooming is simply genius under conditions of market failure.
What Galenson’s argument suggests is something else—that late bloomers
bloom late because they simply aren’t much good until late in their
careers.

“All these qualities of his inner vision were continually hampered and
obstructed by Cézanne’s incapacity to give sufficient verisimilitude to
the personae of his drama,” the great English art critic Roger Fry wrote
of the early Cézanne. “With all his rare endowments, he happened to lack
the comparatively common gift of illustration, the gift that any
draughtsman for the illustrated papers learns in a school of commercial
art; whereas, to realize such visions as Cézanne’s required this gift in
high degree.” In other words, the young Cézanne couldn’t draw. Of “The
Banquet,” which Cézanne painted at thirty-one, Fry writes, “It is no use
to deny that Cézanne has made a very poor job of it.” Fry goes on, “More
happily endowed and more integral personalities have been able to
express themselves harmoniously from the very first. But such rich,
complex, and conflicting natures as Cézanne’s require a long period of
fermentation.” Cézanne was trying something so elusive that he couldn’t
master it until he’d spent decades practicing.

This is the vexing lesson of Fountain’s long attempt to get noticed by
the literary world. On the road to great achievement, the late bloomer
will resemble a failure: while the late bloomer is revising and
despairing and changing course and slashing canvases to ribbons after
months or years, what he or she produces will look like the kind of
thing produced by the artist who will never bloom at all. Prodigies are
easy. They advertise their genius from the get-go. Late bloomers are
hard. They require forbearance and blind faith. (Let’s just be thankful
that Cézanne didn’t have a guidance counsellor in high school who looked
at his primitive sketches and told him to try accounting.) Whenever we
find a late bloomer, we can’t but wonder how many others like him or her
we have thwarted because we prematurely judged their talents. But we
also have to accept that there’s nothing we can do about it. How can we
ever know which of the failures will end up blooming?

Not long after meeting Ben Fountain, I went to see the novelist Jonathan
Safran Foer, the author of the 2002 best-seller “Everything Is
Illuminated.” Fountain is a graying man, slight and modest, who looks,
in the words of a friend of his, like a “golf pro from Augusta,
Georgia.” Foer is in his early thirties and looks barely old enough to
drink. Fountain has a softness to him, as if years of struggle have worn
away whatever sharp edges he once had. Foer gives the impression that if
you touched him while he was in full conversational flight you would get
an electric shock.

“I came to writing really by the back door,” Foer said. “My wife is a
writer, and she grew up keeping journals—you know, parents said, ‘Lights
out, time for bed,’ and she had a little flashlight under the covers,
reading books. I don’t think I *read* a book until much later than other
people. I just wasn’t interested in it.”

Foer went to Princeton and took a creative-writing class in his freshman
year with Joyce Carol Oates. It was, he explains, “sort of on a whim,
maybe out of a sense that I should have a diverse course load.” He’d
never written a story before. “I didn’t really think anything of it, to
be honest, but halfway through the semester I arrived to class early one
day, and she said, ‘Oh, I’m glad I have this chance to talk to you. I’m
a fan of your writing.’ And it was a *real* revelation for me.”

Oates told him that he had the most important of writerly qualities,
which was energy. He had been writing fifteen pages a week for that
class, an entire story for each seminar. “Why does a dam with a crack in
it leak so much?” he said, with a laugh. “There was just something in
me, there was like a pressure.”

As a sophomore, he took another creative-writing class. During the
following summer, he went to Europe. He wanted to find the village in
Ukraine where his grandfather had come from. After the trip, he went to
Prague. There he read Kafka, as any literary undergraduate would, and
sat down at his computer.

“I was just writing,” he said. “I didn’t know that I was writing until
it was happening. I didn’t go with the intention of writing a book. I
wrote three hundred pages in ten weeks. I *really* wrote. I’d never done
it like that.”

It was a novel about a boy named Jonathan Safran Foer who visits the
village in Ukraine where his grandfather had come from. Those three
hundred pages were the first draft of “Everything Is Illuminated”—the
exquisite and extraordinary novel that established Foer as one of the
most distinctive literary voices of his generation. He was nineteen
years old.

Foer began to talk about the other way of writing books, where you
painstakingly honed your craft, over years and years. “I couldn’t do
that,” he said. He seemed puzzled by it. It was clear that he had no
understanding of how being an experimental innovator would work. “I
mean, imagine if the craft you’re trying to learn is to be an original.
How could you learn the craft of being an original?”

He began to describe his visit to Ukraine. “I went to the shtetl where
my family came from. It’s called Trachimbrod, the name I use in the
book. It’s a real place. But you know what’s funny? It’s the single
piece of research that made its way into the book.” He wrote the first
sentence, and he was proud of it, and then he went back and forth in his
mind about where to go next. “I spent the first week just having this
debate with myself about what to do with this first sentence. And once I
made the decision, I felt liberated to just create—and it was very
explosive after that.”

If you read “Everything Is Illuminated,” you end up with the same
feeling you get when you read “Brief Encounters with Che Guevara”—the
sense of transport you experience when a work of literature draws you
into its own world. Both are works of art. It’s just that, as artists,
Fountain and Foer could not be less alike. Fountain went to Haiti thirty
times. Foer went to Trachimbrod just once. “I mean, it was nothing,”
Foer said. “I had absolutely no experience there at all. It was just a
springboard for my book. It was like an empty swimming pool that had to
be filled up.” Total time spent getting inspiration for his novel: three
days.

Ben Fountain did not make the decision to quit the law and become a
writer all by himself. He is married and has a family. He met his wife,
Sharon, when they were both in law school at Duke. When he was doing
real-estate work at Akin, Gump, she was on the partner track in the tax
practice at Thompson & Knight. The two actually worked in the same
building in downtown Dallas. They got married in 1985, and had a son in
April of 1987. Sharie, as Fountain calls her, took four months of
maternity leave before returning to work. She made partner by the end of
that year.

“We had our son in a day care downtown,” she recalls. “We would drive in
together, one of us would take him to day care, the other one would go
to work. One of us would pick him up, and then, somewhere around eight
o’clock at night, we would have him bathed, in bed, and then we hadn’t
even eaten yet, and we’d be looking at each other, going, ‘This is just
the beginning.’ ” She made a face. “That went on for maybe a month or
two, and Ben’s like, ‘I don’t know how people do this.’ We both agreed
that continuing at that pace was probably going to make us all
miserable. Ben said to me, ‘Do you want to stay home?’ Well, I was
pretty happy in my job, and he wasn’t, so as far as I was concerned it
didn’t make any sense for me to stay home. And I didn’t have anything
besides practicing law that I really wanted to do, and he did. So I
said, ‘Look, can we do this in a way that we can still have some day
care and so you can write?’ And so we did that.”

Ben could start writing at seven-thirty in the morning because Sharie
took their son to day care. He stopped working in the afternoon because
that was when he had to pick him up, and then he did the shopping and
the household chores. In 1989, they had a second child, a daughter.
Fountain was a full-fledged North Dallas stay-at-home dad.

“When Ben first did this, we talked about the fact that it might not
work, and we talked about, generally, ‘When will we know that it really
isn’t working?’ and I’d say, ‘Well, give it ten years,’ ” Sharie
recalled. To her, ten years didn’t seem unreasonable. “It takes a while
to decide whether you like something or not,” she says. And when ten
years became twelve and then fourteen and then sixteen, and the kids
were off in high school, she stood by him, because, even during that
long stretch when Ben had nothing published at all, she was confident
that he was getting better. She was fine with the trips to Haiti, too.
“I can’t imagine writing a novel about a place you haven’t at least
tried to visit,” she says. She even went with him once, and on the way
into town from the airport there were people burning tires in the middle
of the road.

“I was making pretty decent money, and we didn’t need two incomes,”
Sharie went on. She has a calm, unflappable quality about her. “I mean,
it would have been nice, but we could live on one.”

Sharie was Ben’s wife. But she was also—to borrow a term from long
ago—his patron. That word has a condescending edge to it today, because
we think it far more appropriate for artists (and everyone else for that
matter) to be supported by the marketplace. But the marketplace works
only for people like Jonathan Safran Foer, whose art emerges, fully
realized, at the beginning of their career, or Picasso, whose talent was
so blindingly obvious that an art dealer offered him a
hundred-and-fifty-franc-a-month stipend the minute he got to Paris, at
age twenty. If you are the type of creative mind that starts without a
plan, and has to experiment and learn by doing, you need someone to see
you through the long and difficult time it takes for your art to reach
its true level.

This is what is so instructive about any biography of Cézanne. Accounts
of his life start out being about Cézanne, and then quickly turn into
the story of Cézanne’s circle. First and foremost is always his best
friend from childhood, the writer Émile Zola, who convinces the awkward
misfit from the provinces to come to Paris, and who serves as his
guardian and protector and coach through the long, lean years.

Here is Zola, already in Paris, in a letter to the young Cézanne back in
Provence. Note the tone, more paternal than fraternal:

> You ask me an odd question. Of course one can work here, as anywhere
> else, if one has the will. Paris offers, further, an advantage you
> can’t find elsewhere: the museums in which you can study the old
> masters from 11 to 4. This is how you must divide your time. From 6 to
> 11 you go to a studio to paint from a live model; you have lunch, then
> from 12 to 4 you copy, in the Louvre or the Luxembourg, whatever
> masterpiece you like. That will make up nine hours of work. I think
> that ought to be enough.

Zola goes on, detailing exactly how Cézanne could manage financially on
a monthly stipend of a hundred and twenty-five francs:

> I’ll reckon out for you what you should spend. A room at 20 francs a
> month; lunch at 18 sous and dinner at 22, which makes two francs a
> day, or 60 francs a month. . . . Then you have the studio to pay for:
> the Atelier Suisse, one of the least expensive, charges, I think, 10
> francs. Add 10 francs for canvas, brushes, colors; that makes 100. So
> you’ll have 25 francs left for laundry, light, the thousand little
> needs that turn up.

Camille Pissarro was the next critical figure in Cézanne’s life. It was
Pissarro who took Cézanne under his wing and taught him how to be a
painter. For years, there would be periods in which they went off into
the country and worked side by side.

Then there was Ambrose Vollard, the sponsor of Cézanne’s first one-man
show, at the age of fifty-six. At the urging of Pissarro, Renoir, Degas,
and Monet, Vollard hunted down Cézanne in Aix. He spotted a still-life
in a tree, where it had been flung by Cézanne in disgust. He poked
around the town, putting the word out that he was in the market for
Cézanne’s canvases. In “Lost Earth: A Life of Cézanne,” the biographer
Philip Callow writes about what happened next:

> Before long someone appeared at his hotel with an object wrapped in a
> cloth. He sold the picture for 150 francs, which inspired him to trot
> back to his house with the dealer to inspect several more magnificent
> Cézannes. Vollard paid a thousand francs for the job lot, then on the
> way out was nearly hit on the head by a canvas that had been
> overlooked, dropped out the window by the man’s wife. All the pictures
> had been gathering dust, half buried in a pile of junk in the attic.

All this came before Vollard agreed to sit a hundred and fifty times,
from eight in the morning to eleven-thirty, without a break, for a
picture that Cézanne disgustedly abandoned. Once, Vollard recounted in
his memoir, he fell asleep, and toppled off the makeshift platform.
Cézanne berated him, incensed: “Does an apple move?” This is called
friendship.

Finally, there was Cézanne’s father, the banker Louis-Auguste. From the
time Cézanne first left Aix, at the age of twenty-two, Louis-Auguste
paid his bills, even when Cézanne gave every indication of being nothing
more than a failed dilettante. But for Zola, Cézanne would have remained
an unhappy banker’s son in Provence; but for Pissarro, he would never
have learned how to paint; but for Vollard (at the urging of Pissarro,
Renoir, Degas, and Monet), his canvases would have rotted away in some
attic; and, but for his father, Cézanne’s long apprenticeship would have
been a financial impossibility. That is an extraordinary list of
patrons. The first three—Zola, Pissarro, and Vollard—would have been
famous even if Cézanne never existed, and the fourth was an unusually
gifted entrepreneur who left Cézanne four hundred thousand francs when
he died. Cézanne didn’t just have help. He had a dream team in his
corner.

This is the final lesson of the late bloomer: his or her success is
highly contingent on the efforts of others. In biographies of Cézanne,
Louis-Auguste invariably comes across as a kind of grumpy philistine,
who didn’t appreciate his son’s genius. But Louis-Auguste didn’t have to
support Cézanne all those years. He would have been within his rights to
make his son get a real job, just as Sharie might well have said no to
her husband’s repeated trips to the chaos of Haiti. She could have
argued that she had some right to the life style of her profession and
status—that she deserved to drive a BMW, which is what power couples in
North Dallas drive, instead of a Honda Accord, which is what she settled
for.

But she believed in her husband’s art, or perhaps, more simply, she
believed in her husband, the same way Zola and Pissarro and Vollard
and—in his own, querulous way—Louis-Auguste must have believed in
Cézanne. Late bloomers’ stories are invariably love stories, and this
may be why we have such difficulty with them. We’d like to think that
mundane matters like loyalty, steadfastness, and the willingness to keep
writing checks to support what looks like failure have nothing to do
with something as rarefied as genius. But sometimes genius is anything
but rarefied; sometimes it’s just the thing that emerges after twenty
years of working at your kitchen table.

“Sharie never once brought up money, not once—never,” Fountain said. She
was sitting next to him, and he looked at her in a way that made it
plain that he understood how much of the credit for “Brief Encounters”
belonged to his wife. His eyes welled up with tears. “I never felt any
pressure from her,” he said. “Not even covert, not even implied.” ♦
