Actors vs. Reactive Objects
---------------------------

In their paper [Reactive
Objects](http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/projects/Timber/reactive-objects.pdf)
the authors compare reactive objects to the actor model (at the end of
the Related Work section). They give three advantages reactive objects
have over actors:

1.  messages to undefined methods are simply queued
2.  the Actor model lacks synchronous messages
3.  asynchronous message delivery is not order-preserving

These may have been true of the original Actor model but a modern
implementation seems to feature improvements to all three points. For
example, on point 2, [Io](http://www.iolanguage.com/about/) features
both synchronous & asynchronous message passing, where you either
synchronise on the result, send the message asynchronously (prefix any
message with @ and be given a future that transforms into the final
result when known) or send it & ignore the result (prefix any message
with @@). Undefined messages are sent up the inheritance chain, and
asynchronous message delivery is handled on a first-in first-out basis.

What alternative do reactive objects offer on point 1? I've not managed
to work that out from the paper. Any pointers would be appreciated! I'm
basically trying to situate Reactive Objects in comparison to the Actor
model, functional-reactive programming, and other means of situating
software as a means of responding to it's environment rather than the
other way around (particularly in relation to GUI research).

### [Depends on what you mean by "Actors model"](node/2203#comment-29325)

The classic Actors model (ala Hewitt, and later Agha) to which the paper
refers does indeed have only asynchronous message passing. However,
synchronization can be emulated by pairs of asynchronous messages, and
some *implementations* of the Actors model seem to include syntactic
sugar for such situations.

The difference between reactive objects and actors with regard to
undefined methods seems to be the following: depending on its state, an
actor may only respond to some subset of its full set of methods at any
given time (the remainder of the methods being "undefined" at that time,
and calls to those methods being queued); in contrast, reactive objects
will always respond to all methods, no matter what its internal state.

This is a great explaination. An example using a bounded buffer as an
actor accepts both the messages "put" and "get", but not in all states.
If the buffer is empty and A sends "get" a third party will have to send
"put" in order for A to get the reply and proceed.

This kind of selective behaviour based on state, as you clearly
describe, is not possible in Timber.

### [In the context of CSP I've](node/2203#comment-29475)

In the context of CSP I've heard this style described as "I communicate,
therefore I synchronize." (I must read about actors one day.)

### [Thanks for the illustration.](node/2203#comment-29679)

Thanks for the illustration. I was getting confused by the term
'undefined' which I was automatically reading to mean 'an undefined
method/message' as opposed to 'undefined behaviour depending on current
state'. Poor reading on my part!

### [Tripped me up too](node/2203#comment-29684)

Yep, that tripped me up on a first reading too. It took me a little
while to see what it was they were getting at.
