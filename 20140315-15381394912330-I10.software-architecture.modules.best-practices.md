Microservices
=============

*The term "Microservice Architecture" has sprung up over the last few
years to describe a particular way of designing software applications as
suites of independently deployable services. While there is no precise
definition of this architectural style, there are certain common
characteristics around organization around business capability,
automated deployment, intelligence in the endpoints, and decentralized
control of languages and data.*

development. He's long been puzzled by the problem of how componentize
software systems, having heard more vague claims than he's happy with.
He hopes that microservices will live up to the early promise its
advocates have found.

"Microservices" - yet another new term on the crowded streets of
software architecture. Although our natural inclination is to pass such
things by with a contemptuous glance, this bit of terminology describes
a style of software systems that we are finding more and more appealing.
We've seen many projects use this style in the last few years, and
results so far have been positive, so much so that for many of our
colleagues this is becoming the default style for building enterprise
applications. Sadly, however, there's not much information that outlines
what the microservice style is and how to do it.

In short, the microservice architectural style
[[1]](#footnote-etymology) is an approach to developing a single
application as a suite of small services, each running in its own
process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP
resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and
independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There
is a bare mininum of centralized management of these services, which may
be written in different programming languages and use different data
storage technologies.

To start explaining the microservice style it's useful to compare it to
the monolithic style: a monolithic application built as a single unit.
Enterprise Applications are often built in three main parts: a
client-side user interface (consisting of HTML pages and javascript
running in a browser on the user's machine) a database (consisting of
many tables inserted into a common, and usually relational, database
management system), and a server-side application. The server-side
application will handle HTTP requests, execute domain logic, retrieve
and update data from the database, and select and populate HTML views to
be sent to the browser. This server-side application is a *monolith* - a
single logical executable[[2]](#footnote-monolith). Any changes to the
system involve building and deploying a new version of the server-side
application.

Such a monolithic server is a natural way to approach building such a
system. All your logic for handling a request runs in a single process,
allowing you to use the basic features of your language to divide up the
application into classes, functions, and namespaces. With some care, you
can run and test the application on a developer's laptop, and use a
deployment pipeline to ensure that changes are properly tested and
deployed into production. You can horizontally scale the monolith by
running many instances behind a load-balancer.

Monolithic applications can be successful, but increasingly people are
feeling frustrations with them - especially as more applications are
being deployed to the cloud . Change cycles are tied together - a change
made to a small part of the application, requires the entire monolith to
be rebuilt and deployed. Over time it's often hard to keep a good
modular structure, making it harder to keep changes that ought to only
affect one module within that module. Scaling requires scaling of the
entire application rather than parts of it that require greater
resource.

![Figure 1](microservices/images/sketch.png)

Figure 1: Monoliths and Microservices

These frustrations have led to the microservice architectural style:
building applications as suites of services. As well as the fact that
services are independently deployable and scalable, each service also
provides a firm module boundary, even allowing for different services to
be written in different programming languages. They can also be managed
by different teams .

We do not claim that the microservice style is novel or innovative, its
roots go back at least to the design principles of Unix. But we do think
that not enough people consider a microservice architecture and that
many software developments would be better off if they used it.

Characteristics of a Microservice Architecture
----------------------------------------------

We cannot say there is a formal definition of the microservices
architectural style, but we can attempt to describe what we see as
common characteristics for architectures that fit the label. As with any
definition that outlines common characteristics, not all microservice
architectures have all the characteristics, but we do expect that most
microservice architectures exhibit most characteristics. While we
authors have been active members of this rather loose community, our
intention is to attempt a description of what we see in our own work and
in similar efforts by teams we know of. In particular we are not laying
down some definition to conform to.

### Componentization via Services

For as long as we've been involved in the software industry, there's
been a desire to build systems by plugging together components, much in
the way we see things are made in the physical world. During the last
couple of decades we've seen considerable progress with large
compendiums of common libraries that are part of most language
platforms.

When talking about components we run into the difficult definition of
what makes a component. Our definition is that a **component** is a unit
of software that is independently replaceable and upgradeable.

Microservice architectures will use libraries, but their primary way of
componentizing their own software is by breaking down into services. We
define **libraries** as components that are linked into a program and
called using in-memory function calls, while **services** are
out-of-process components who communicate with a mechanism such as a web
service request, or remote procedure call. (This is a different concept
to that of a service object in many OO programs
[[3]](#footnote-service-object).)

One main reason for using services as components (rather than libraries)
is that services are independently deployable. If you have an
application [[4]](#footnote-application) that consists of a multiple
libraries in a single process, a change to any single component results
in having to redeploy the entire application. But if that application is
decomposed into multiple services, you can expect many single service
changes to only require that service to be redeployed. That's not an
absolute, some changes will change service interfaces resulting in some
coordination, but the aim of a good microservice architecture is to
minimize these through cohesive service boundaries and evolution
mechanisms in the service contracts.

Another consequence of using services as components is a more explicit
component interface. Most languages do not have a good mechanism for
defining an explicit [Published
Interface](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PublishedInterface.html). Often
it's only documentation and discipline that prevents clients breaking a
component's encapsulation, leading to overly-tight coupling between
components. Services make it easier to avoid this by using explicit
remote call mechanisms.

Using services like this does have downsides. Remote calls are more
expensive than in-process calls, and thus remote APIs need to be
coarser-grained, which is often more awkward to use. If you need to
change the allocation of responsibilities between components, such
movements of behavior are harder to do when you're crossing process
boundaries.

At a first approximation, we can observe that services map to runtime
processes, but that is only a first approximation. A service may consist
of multiple processes that will always be developed and deployed
together, such as an application process and a database that's only used
by that service.

### Organized around Business Capabilities

When looking to split a large application into parts, often management
focuses on the technology layer, leading to UI teams, server-side logic
teams, and database teams. When teams are separated along these lines,
even simple changes can lead to a cross-team project taking time and
budgetary approval. A smart team will optimise around this and plump for
the lesser of two evils - just force the logic into whichever
application they have access to. Logic everywhere in other words. This
is an example of Conway's Law[[5]](#footnote-conwayslaw) in action.

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce
> a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication
> structure.
>
> -- Melvyn Conway, 1967

![Figure 2](microservices/images/conways-law.png)

Figure 2: Conway's Law in action

The microservice approach to division is different, splitting up into
services organized around **business capability**. Such services take a
broad-stack implementation of software for that business area, including
user-interface, persistant storage, and any external collaborations.
Consequently the teams are cross-functional, including the full range of
skills required for the development: user-experience, database, and
project management.

### How big is a microservice?

Although “microservice” has become a popular name for this architectural
style, it's name does lead to an unfortunate focus on the size of
service, and arguments about what constitutes “micro”. In our
conversations with microservice practitioners, we see a range of sizes
of services. The largest sizes reported follow Amazon's notion of the
Two Pizza Team (i.e. the whole team can be fed by two pizzas), meaning
no more than a dozen people. On the smaller size scale we've seen setups
where a team of half-a-dozen would support half-a-dozen services.

This leads to the question of whether there are sufficiently large
differences within this size range that the service-per-dozen-people and
service-per-person sizes shouldn't be lumped under one microservices
label. At the moment we think it's better to group them together, but
it's certainly possible that we'll change our mind as we explore this
style further.

One company organised in this way is
[www.comparethemarket.com](http://www.comparethemarket.com). Cross
functional teams are responsible for building and operating each product
and each product is split out into a number of individual services
communicating via a message bus.

Large monolithic applications can always be modularized around business
capabilities too, although that's not the common case. Certainly we
would urge a large team building a monolithic application to divide
itself along business lines. The main issue we have seen here, is that
they tend to be organised around *too many* contexts. If the monolith
spans many of these modular boundaries it can be difficult for
individual members of a team to fit them into their short-term memory.
Additionally we see that the modular lines require a great deal of
discipline to enforce, the necessarily, more explicit separation
required by service components makes it easier to keep the team
boundaries clear.

### Products not Projects

Most application development efforts that we see use a project model:
where the aim is to deliver some piece of software which is then
considered to be completed. On completion the software is handed over to
a maintenance organization and the project team that built it is
disbanded.

Microservice proponents tend to avoid this model, preferring instead the
notion that a team should own a product over its full lifetime. A common
inspiration for this is Amazon's notion of ["you build, you run
it"](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1142065) where a development
team takes full responsibility for the software in production. This
brings developers into day-to-day contact with how their software
behaves in production and increases contact with their users, as they
have to take on at least some of the support burden.

The product mentality, ties in with the linkage to business
capabilities. Rather than looking at the software as a set of
functionality to be completed, there is an on-going relationship where
the question is how can software assist its users to enhance the
business capability.

There's no reason why this same approach can't be taken with monolithic
applications, but the smaller granularity of services can make it easier
to create the personal relationships between service developers and
their users.

### Smart endpoints and dumb pipes

When building communication structures between different processes,
we've seen many products and approaches that stress putting significant
smarts into the communication mechanism itself. A good example of this
is the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), where ESB products often include
sophisticated facilities for message routing, choreography,
transformation, and applying business rules.

The microservice community favours an alternative approach: *smart
endpoints and dumb pipes*. Applications built from microservices aim to
be as decoupled and as cohesive as possible - they own their own domain
logic and act more as filters in the classical Unix sense - receiving a
request, applying logic as appropriate and producing a response. These
are choreographed using simple RESTish protocols rather than complex
protocols such as WS-Choreography or BPEL or orchestration by a central
tool.

The two protocols used most commonly are HTTP request-response with
resource API's and lightweight messaging[[6]](#footnote-protobufs). The
best expression of the first is

> Be of the web, not behind the web
>
> [-- Ian
> Robinson](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805829?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596805829)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321601912)

Microservice teams use the principles and protocols that the world wide
web (and to a large extent, Unix) is built on. Often used resources can
be cached with very little effort on the part of developers or
operations folk.

The second approach in common use is messaging over a lightweight
message bus. The infrastructure chosen is typically dumb (dumb as in
acts as a message router only) - simple implementations such as RabbitMQ
or ZeroMQ don't do much more than provide a reliable asynchronous fabric
- the smarts still live in the end points that are producing and
consuming messages; in the services.

In a monolith, the components are executing in-process and communication
between them is via either method invocation or function call. The
biggest issue in changing a monolith into microservices lies in changing
the communication pattern. A naive conversion from in-memory method
calls to RPC leads to chatty communications which don't perform well.
Instead you need to replace the fine-graining communication with a
coarser -grained approach.

The next installment will cover the decentralized approach to governance
that microservice practitioners favor. Follow the [RSS feed](/feed.atom)

Footnotes
---------

1: The term "microservice" was discussed at a workshop of software
architects near Venice in May, 2011 to describe what the participants
saw as a common architectural style that many of them had been recently
exploring. In May 2012, the same group decided on "microservices" as the
most appropriate name. James presented some of these ideas as a case
study in March 2012 at 33rd Degree in Krakow in [Microservices - Java,
the Unix Way](http://2012.33degree.org/talk/show/67) as did Fred George
[about the same
time](http://www.slideshare.net/fredgeorge/micro-service-architecure).
Adrian Cockcroft at Netflix, describing this approach as "fine grained
SOA" was pioneering the style at web scale as were many of the others
mentioned in this article - Joe Walnes, Dan North, Evan Botcher and
Graham Tackley.

2: The term monolith has been in use by the Unix community for some
time. It appears in [The Art of Unix
Programming](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003U2T5BA?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003U2T5BA)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321601912)
to describe systems that get too big.

3: Many object-oriented designers, including ourselves, use the term
service object in the [Domain-Driven
Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321125215?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321125215)![image](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321601912)
sense for an object that carries out a significant process that isn't
tied to an entity. This is a different concept to how we're using
"service" in this article. Sadly the term service has both meanings and
we have to live with the polyseme.

4: We consider [an application to be a social
construction](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ApplicationBoundary.html)
that binds together a code base, group of functionality, and body of
funding.

5: The original paper can be found on Melvyn Conway's website
[here](http://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html)

6: At extremes of scale, organisations often move to binary protocols -
[protobufs](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) for example. Systems
using these still exhibit the characteristic of smart endpoints, dumb
pipes - and trade off *transparency* for scale. Most web properties and
certainly the vast majority of enterprises don't need to make this
tradeoff - transparency can be a big win.
