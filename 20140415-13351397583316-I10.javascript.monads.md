A Gentle Introduction to Monads in JavaScript

![monads\_header](http://flippinawesome.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/monads_header.jpg)

*By [Sean Voisen](/authors/sean-voisen)*

Monads: they’re incredibly useful, and also a little intimidating.
Beginner functional programmers often cringe when they hear the term.
JavaScript legend [Douglas Crockford once said that monads are
cursed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkZFtimgAcM) – that once you
understand monads for yourself, you lose the ability to explain them to
others. In the programming language F\#, monads are called
“computational expressions” mostly so people aren’t scared away.

But I think all this fear and mysticism around the dreaded “M-word” need
not be so. So in this post, I’m going to attempt to put a small crack in
the curse, not by attempting to explain all of monad theory in general,
but instead by thoroughly diving into a concrete example of a monad in a
specific language: the Maybe monad in JavaScript
^[1](http://sean.voisen.org/blog/2013/10/intro-monads-maybe/#1)^.

If you’ve been putting off learning about monads – or maybe have never
even heard of them until now – then this post is for you. It will
provide *just enough* material to give you a sense of what monads are
and what they can do. From there you should have a solid stepping off
point from which you can jump into reading something like
[this](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad) without trepidation.

If you’re a seasoned developer, chances are you have already used monads
in your daily practice without even realizing it. For instance, a
[jQuery Deferred](http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/)
object is a monad. So is [jQuery
Ajax](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/), as well as [Bacon.js
EventStream](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js). So this shouldn’t be
too hard to follow.

On occasion, I will reference similarities between the JavaScript
example and its counterparts in the programming language
[Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell). I do this only
because most formal literature on monads references Haskell, and it
helps to become familiar with the language. Feel free to skip these
parts if you prefer.

Maybe We Have a Problem
-----------------------

After the Identity monad, the Maybe monad is perhaps one of the simplest
examples of a monad available. It’s also quite useful.

The Maybe monad provides an elegant solution to the common problem of
multiple nested `null` checks in code. Consider the following trivial
example:

    var person = {
        "name":"Homer Simpson", 
        "address": {
            "street":"123 Fake St.",
            "city":"Springfield"
        }
    };

    if (person != null && person["address"] != null) {
        var state = person["address"]["state"];
        if (state != null) {
            console.log(state);
        }
        else {
            console.log("State unknown");
        }
    }

All those `null` checks are fairly ugly. They’re tedious to write and
annoying to read, an unfortunate side-effect of working in a language in
which `null` was implemented rather poorly. Is there perhaps a way to
factor them out? Yes there is.

Maybe We Have a Solution
------------------------

What we want is to embed the computation of `!= null` into a function,
type or class that we can easily re-use so that we don’t have to spatter
our code with `null` checks. This is exactly what the Maybe monad
provides. In Haskell, the [definition of type
Maybe](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Data-Maybe.html)
is rather succinct:

    data Maybe t = Just t | Nothing

All this means is that an object of type Maybe either has some value
(`Just t`) or no value (`Nothing`). What is meant by `Nothing` depends
on the context. In JavaScript the only things that mean “nothing” are
`null` and `undefined`. But as you will see, with the Maybe monad, we
can change the semantics of “nothing” to suit our needs.

We can begin to model the Haskell definition in JavaScript as follows:

    Maybe = function(value) {
      var Nothing = {};

      var Something = function(value) { 
        return function() {
          return value; 
        };
      };

      if (typeof value === 'undefined' || value === null)
        return Nothing;

      return Something(value);
    };

Now we have a function `Maybe` (in monadic terms, our *unit function*)
that returns an object `Nothing` if the value provided to it is `null`
or `undefined`. Likewise, it returns a function `Something` that returns
the original value if the value is not `null` or `undefined`. (For
clarity, I’ve renamed Haskell’s `Just` with `Something`, as I find this
terminology a bit easier to follow when first being introduced to the
concept.)

What can we do with the above? Let’s try it out:

    Maybe(null) == Nothing; // true
    typeof Maybe(null); // 'object'

    Maybe('foo') == Nothing; // false
    Maybe('foo')(); // 'foo'
    typeof Maybe('foo'); // 'function'

So now we’ve put all of our `!=` null checks into a single function,
which is the constructor for the new `Maybe` type. But is this enough to
solve our problem? Unfortunately, no. Let’s try it out:

    if (Maybe(person) != Nothing && 
      Maybe(person["address"]) != Nothing) 
    {
        var state = Maybe(person["address"]["state"]);
        if (state != Nothing) {
            console.log(state);
        }
        else {
            console.log("State unknown");
        }
    }

So far, all we have done is replace a null check with a check for
`Nothing`. This is not quite what we want.

Maybe We Need Composition
-------------------------

One of the defining characteristics of a monad is that it may be
combined with other monads of the same type. That is, we should be able
to sequence monads together through composition. You may remember that
function composition is the application of one function to the result of
another. Mathematically, given two functions `g` and `f`, the
composition of `g` of `f` is:

    (g ∘ f)(x) = g(f(x))

In the case of Maybe, we need some way to take multiple Maybes and
combine, chain or *bind* them together in a meaningful way. This way, if
one Maybe is `Nothing` we can short-circuit our computation and stop at
`Nothing`, otherwise we can continue on our way, essentially replicating
what the `&&` provides in our first example (technically, in JavaScript
the computation does not short-circuit as it would in a lazy language
like Haskell, but the effect is the same).

We can do this by introducing a method on Maybe called `bind` (in
Haskell, this is the `>>=` operator) that makes specific use of function
composition. This `bind` method applies a function to the value
contained by a Maybe and returns a new Maybe that contains the value of
the function application. Since `Nothing` has no value, anything bound
to a `Nothing` should simply return `Nothing` (our short-circuit).

    Maybe = function(value) {
      var Nothing = {
        bind: function(fn) { return this; }
      };

      var Something = function(value) { 
        return {
          bind: function(fn) { return Maybe(fn.call(this, value)); }
        };
      };

      if (typeof value === 'undefined' || value === null)
        return Nothing;

      return Something(value);
    };

With this new `bind` method we can more elegantly re-write our code:

    var state = Maybe(person).bind(function(p) { 
      return p["address"];
    }).bind(function(a) {
      return a["state"];
    });

    if (state == Nothing) {
      console.log("State unknown");
    }
    else {
      console.log(state);
    }

Certainly this is better than before, but can we do better?

Maybe We Can Do Better
----------------------

It would be nice if we could eliminate the final `if ... else` statement
in the example above. It would also be nice if we could sequence
multiple Maybes together without the need for `bind` in the case when we
don’t plan on using the result of the bind. Fortunately, with our new
Maybe type we can do all this and more. Here’s the final Maybe code with
a few new methods (`isNothing`, `val` and `maybe`) that provide some
additional utility:

    Maybe = function(value) {
      var Nothing = {
        bind: function(fn) { 
          return this; 
        },
        isNothing: function() { 
          return true; 
        },
        val: function() { 
          throw new Error("cannot call val() nothing"); 
        },
        maybe: function(def, fn) {
          return def;
        }
      };

      var Something = function(value) { 
        return {
          bind: function(fn) { 
            return Maybe(fn.call(this, value));
          },
          isNothing: function() { 
            return false; 
          },
          val: function() { 
            return value;
          },
          maybe: function(def, fn) {
            return fn.call(this, value);
          }
        };
      };

      if (typeof value === 'undefined' || value === null)
        return Nothing;

      return Something(value);
    };

### isNothing() and val()

The `isNothing` and `val` functions are rather self-explanatory. The
`isNothing` function returns `true` if the Maybe is `Nothing` and
`false` otherwise. The `val` function simply returns the value inside
the Maybe monad if it is “something,” similar to Haskell’s `fromJust`
function. If the Maybe is `Nothing` then `val` will throw an error. We
don’t require these methods for our example (or even for Maybe to be a
monad), but they often prove useful elsewhere.

### maybe(def, fn)

The `maybe` function is the most useful for our purposes, and is
identical to the `maybe` function for [Haskell’s Maybe
monad](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Data-Maybe.html).
It takes a default value (`def`) and a function `fn` and if the Maybe is
`Nothing`, returns the default value, otherwise it applies the function
to the contents of the Maybe and returns the result. We can use this
handy function to rid ourselves of the final `if ... else` statement in
our example:

    console.log(Maybe(person).bind(function(p) { 
      return p["address"];
    }).bind(function(a) {
      return a["state"];
    }).maybe("State unknown", function(s) { 
      return s; 
    }));

*And now we have our solution.*

But is Maybe a Monad?
---------------------

Thus far, I’ve been calling our Maybe implementation a monad without
really proving it. Nevertheless, hopefully you now have at least a vague
sense of what a monad *is*, even if I haven’t presented any kind of
formal definition.

So, what is a monad? Perhaps the most intuitive way to think about
monads is as **chainable computations**, or even “programmable
semicolons.” They allow us to wrap up computations and sequence them in
meaningful ways. In the case of the Maybe monad, the computations that
we choose to wrap up are our` != null` checks, and we sequence them
through our chained use of `bind`.

Of course, monads may also be defined more formally. For our Maybe
example to truly be a monad it must have three particular properties and
obey three particular laws. Of the three properties it must:

-   Have a *type constructor* that defines its type.
-   Have a *unit function* that converts a value of some type to its
    corresponding monadic type. This is the Maybe function.
-   Have a *binding operation* that takes a monad, a function that takes
    a some type and returns a monad. This is our `bind` function (Again,
    note that in our example, the function type signature varies
    slightly from this definition, as we automatically wrap the result
    of our binding function in Maybe).

As for the three laws, these are known as: left identity, right
identity, and associativity. In JavaScript, *with our example*, these
laws may be written as follows:

### Left identity

    Maybe(x).bind(fn) == Maybe(fn(x)); // for all x, fn

### Right identity

    Maybe(x).bind(function(x){return x;}) == Maybe(x); // for all x

### Associativity

    Maybe(x).bind(fn).bind(gn) == Maybe(x).bind(function(x) {
      return gn(fn(x));
    }); // for all x, fn, gn

Feel free to try these laws out with a few examples to see that they
hold true.

Redefining Nothing
------------------

We’re almost finished, but I want to take things one step further.
Thanks to JavaScript readily allowing us to manipulate an object’s
prototype, we can perform some additional tricks that make Maybe even
more useful.

Consider the following alteration to our running example:

    var person1 = {
        "name":"Homer Simpson", 
        "address": {
            "street":"123 Fake St.",
            "city":"Springfield"
        }
    };

    var people = [person1];

    if (people != null && people.length > 0) {
      console.log(people[0]);
    }

It would be nice if we could wrap up our check for an empty array as
part of our Maybe monad. Fortunately we can. First, we will “mix in” a
new function called `isNothing` on the prototype of Array:

    Array.prototype.isNothing = function() {
      return self.length == 0;
    }

Next, we will extend the Maybe constructor to check for this function on
all provided values:

    Maybe = function(value) {
      // Nothing and Something definitions go here ...

      if (typeof value === 'undefined' || 
          value === null || 
          (typeof value.isNothing !== 'undefined' && value.isNothing()))
      {
        return Nothing;
      }

      return Something(value);
    };

Now we can refactor our `null` and empty array checks using bind as
before:

    console.log(Maybe(people).bind(function(people){return people[0]}).maybe("No person", function(person) {
      return person;
    }));

Using the same trick, we can change the definition of `Nothing` for any
object type we choose.

Conclusion
----------

Hopefully this short introduction to Maybe and the world of monads has
proven that the dreaded “M-word” need not be as intimidating as it
sounds. Hopefully it has also shown that monads like Maybe can be quite
useful, even in imperative languages like JavaScript.

Remember, a monad is really nothing more than a **chainable
computation**. It is simply a functional way to sequence things. That’s
it.

So, if you haven’t already, I encourage you to try the above Maybe
examples for yourself, and perhaps even implement them in another
language (I have an [Objective-C
implementation](https://github.com/svoisen/SVMaybe), for instance).
Then, go forth and try making other monads using Maybe as a template.
It’s not as hard as it sounds and the rewards may be some very, very
useful code.

    Crockford’s talk is incorrect in its definition of Monads, and you
    seem to have used that as the primary source of learning on the
    subject. If you look here:
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad\_(functional\_programming)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming))
    you’ll find the formal definition. What you and Crockford think are
    monads are actually functors, transformations on data held inside a
    type of encapsulating structure. This is still a good thing, but you
    should remove your references to Monads and change it to Functors.

        said:

        I’m not sure I follow the argument. Monads ARE functors, and in
        fact monads are applicative functors too.

        Functors apply a function to an encapsulated value and return an
        encapsulated value (fmap :: (a-\>b) -\> fa -\> fb). Applicative
        functors apply an encapsulated function to an encapsulated value
        and return an encapsulated value ( :: f(a-\>b) -\> f(a) -\>
        f(b)). Monads apply a function that returns an encapsulated
        value to an encapsulated value (\>\>= :: fa -\> (a -\> fb) -\>
        fb).

        In this example, it is tempting to say that bind has the same
        type as fmap, so we don’t have a monad. (After all, it does
        apply a function to an encapsulated value and return an
        encapsulated value). But fmap doesn’t allow chaining, and in
        this example it couldn’t be defined as a method on Maybe to be
        implemented correctly. It would have to be a standalone function
        that takes two arguments. Essentially, by making fmap a method
        on Maybe, we have created \>\>=, since it now by default accepts
        a monad as its first argument (the instance on which it is a
        method). As such, we have more than just transformations on
        data; we have chainable transformations on data (aka a monad).

    Also, F\# computation expressions are not monads. They are usually

    Some examples doesn’t seem to work at all.

    Considering the “then(maybe)” example:\

    Same thing for your last example:\
     If `people` is actually null, you’ll get an error the moment you
    try to pass it to the first Maybe.

    The whole concept of using a function to verify whether a variable

        You are correct about the “then” examples. JavaScript doesn’t
        support lazy evaluation like Haskell, so they do fail (every
        param passed to “then” will get evaluated no matter what). I
        will have to remove them. I added them last-minute, and that’s
        what I get for not thoroughly checking.

        You can, however, use a function to verify whether a variable is
        of type undefined (making bind still useful), but not if it is
        never defined at all.

    Nice write-up. There’s this though… you should do undefined checks

    it this way:\
     maybe(person)\

    Nice post, I find in JavaScript people tend not to realize monads is
    just a fancy term for method chaining, which the new promise apis
    are bringing int more prominence, and ALL of jquery uses. Also you
    should declare all your variables with \`var\`, and most of your
    functions look like they might be better written as \`function
    Name(args){\` not \`Name = function(args){\`.

    Most awesome post, very impressed.

    I’ve put this to immediate use in my coding for both client and
    server side JS.

    Thank you!

    Interesting pattern. I decided to create my own variation of this
    with CoffeeScript and wanted to share it:
    [https://github.com/KarlPurk/maybe](https://github.com/KarlPurk/maybe).
    I’m guessing what I’ve created isn’t a monad, but it seems useful
    nonetheless. Thanks for the post.

    I always do:\
     var state = person&&person.address&&person.address.state\
     Monads can be more readable though.
