[Self Employed CV](item?id=8226643)

How do you guys and girls go about adding self employed periods to your
CV?

Are they a help or hindrance in tech?

I've got quite a few periods in mine and are updating it at the moment.
By reading some message boards it appears self employment is a really
bad thing!

Any thoughts on how to market self employment?

Thanks :)

 Build your CV around *projects* not *employers* (I was taught this
style of CV writing when I worked at Andersen Consulting (aka Accenture)
and it's one of a handful of things from that time that stuck with me).
Also try to state clearly and concisely what the project was and what
your role was. AC also suggested anonymizing employers -- e.g. "medium
sized construction company" which is a wise thing to do if the work is
not public.

 This is great advice. I'd go even further and say it's about
*achievements*. Make your CV about specific highlights in which you can
justify your involvement.

Once you've passed the stage where you're applying for entry-level
positions, nobody really cares about "My duties involved..." style
entries, or "I participated in..." or "I was involved with..."

Rather, it's all about "I designed and wrote four modules for XYZ
product, three involving the internal messaging layer and a fourth
interfacing with a legacy system, and performed code reviews for other
subsystems," or "I was front-line support for XYZ product during its
first high-growth period, during which I identified and categorized the
most common issues and wrote several procedures to resolve them".

This style might only represent 20% of your actual work around that
time, but it gives your potential employers something concrete to latch
onto, and to an extent it lets you guide the course of the interview in
ways you couldn't otherwise. It also lets you gloss over differences in
employed/self-employed status because it shows you had a consistent work
ethic (and presumably a consistent set of results) regardless of where
you got your income at that time.

 Be careful with functional resumes. A lot of recruiters/hiring managers
don't care for them. Myself included. They can work, but I also
sometimes they can be used to 'hide' inexperience. Disclaimer: I don't
do tech recruiting so take all of this with a grain of salt. I have
reviewed resumes for technical/'social innovation' positions but I tend
to focus more on non computery roles.

That being said, having a nice list of what your good at is great. Also
I really recommend having a summary at the top that is almost like a
mini cover letter. Target it towards the job you're applying for for
example:

Sudorank is a developer with experience developing mid-sized systems in
ruby on rails hooking into legacy COBOL backends. Lauded for his/her
ability to mentally parse XML, he/she can manually code systems using a
magnetic needle. Comfortable leading teams Sudorank has had experience
working a variety of fields, from bio-med to lifestyle startups.

Keep in mind is that you want to save the recruiter/HM time. They might
be looking at 100 of these. Lead with why you're kickass.

Another handy trick is keep a plan text version for if you end up
applying through any automated systems. Source control is your friend
here.

 There's an enormous tension between CVs that are short and to-the-point
and CVs that pass some kind of idiotic "weight" test. The solution is:

\a) To be brief and to the point (and honest), and b) to put your stuff
in reverse chronological order -- so the recent (and hopefully relevant)
stuff is up top.

The rest of it is there in case there's a weight test, or for when the
CV has been shortlisted and is being given a closer look.

Finally, you need to exercise judgment in how fine-grained you get with
"projects". You don't want to give the impression you're padding or
claiming credit for projects you had little hand in. (And consider
tailoring your CV for the job. I do not always do this, but I always do
it for jobs I really care about.)

 I advocate people keep it up to date all the time - well, every 6-12
months. Spend 15-30 minutes adding achievements/projects on the resume
when it's still relatively fresh in your mind, vs trying to remember
stuff 5 years later.

If you have a habit of keeping a resume updated, and it's public, it's
less of a signal to current employers as well too. I've heard many
people say they don't ever want to public/post a resume because their
current employer might find it. If you keep it public and posted all the
time, as more of a "here's the great stuff I'm doing at XYZ", there's no
'signal' to be inferred.

That said, I know that wouldn't necessarily fly in ever industry, but...
that's more social convention than anything else. If 90% of people
behaved that way, that would be the 'new norm'.

 There's nothing to prevent you from providing references and so forth

 Which forums? Not everyone uses the term the same way. I stopped saying
"self-employed" and started calling myself "entrepreneur".

When I said self employed, people either heard "unemployed" or "marginal
freelance person, barely made ends meet". When I switched to
entrepreneur, people heard "successful businessman". The change was
uncanny.

Now, my activities didn't change. So the questions to ask are:

      1. How did the people complaining about self-employed mean the term?
      2. Does that match what you do?
      3. How should you brand it so that the person hiring you understands it correctly?

I never had a problem with other entrepreneurs or managers. We spoke the
same language. I even got some unsolicited job offers when working for
myself, which never happened before.

In general, I think it's seen as a positive thing, as long as you're
talking about the kind of self-employment we mean here on Hacker News.
Fairly lucrative, manage your own schedule, no shortage of clients, but
more overhead and uncertainty than a job and a need to focus on
non-technical stuff. The latter two points explaining why someone might
want a job instead of self-employment.

 This is solely my opinion, but whenever I hear people call themselves
"entrepreneur" I immediately think "C student in high school with few
tangible skills but is sick of working as a cook at Denny's and thinks
calling themselves an entrepreneur will lend them some weird street cred
because they heard Dre call himself an entrepreneur".

At least being simply self-employed is easily explained away by just
wanting to do some freelance work or consulting for a few months or
whatever.

 You could always change your title from something like "CEO of XYZ
Co.", "Founder at Acme Inc.", or "Chairman of Dog Corp" to something
less ambitious like "lead developer", "marketing manager", or even just
"web developer".

Sure, occasionally, you might get employers in the valley who (claim)
they care a lot about your personal growth, but from my experience
outside the tech world, plenty of employers would much rather just have
a dull but trustworthy tool who gets the job done without fail to
someone incredibly smart, unscrupulous, and motivated. To these people
(which I will venture to say is the majority of small-business owners),
your ambition is scary to them, so you're better off not coming off as
being ambitious.

TL;DR: best way to market self-employment? Don't. Instead market it as
regular employment where you had a lot of responsibilities.

 Anecdotally, I've found it difficult to persuade potential employers
that I won't just quit after six months and start another business. It's
a legitimate concern on their part - if you're someone who likes the
challenge and (potential) reward of running your own business then
you're less likely to stay in a salaried job for as long as someone
else. Employing someone should really be a long term commitment from
both parties.

Secondly, it's quite hard if you failed. I learnt a huge amount about
running a company, building software, even about *who I am*, when I've
been doing startups, but ultimately the main thing I've demonstrated is
that I can put a lot of time and energy in to projects that fail. I
didn't have the insight to change what needed to change to ensure
success or to walk away earlier to limit my losses. Those aren't great
things to show people.

All in all, being self-employed does make it harder to get a job
afterwards. If you recognise *why* though, you can defend yourself
against those issues that employers will have.

 On a more optimistic note, from an employer point of view, I would
prefer if you had made some mistakes in the past on your own funds, and
hopefully, learned a good lesson in the process, and would not reproduce
them with the company money.

 If "employing someone should really be a long term commitment from both
parties," then employers need to start treating it as such again. Right
now this is simply one among many, many imbalances between employees and
employers: the loyalty demand is, in my view, a one-way street.

Employees are not to expect long-term loyalty style commitments from
employers these days. Training, retirement investment packages, career
paths and other intangibles that make a long-term commitment at a single
employer potentially a good move don't exist anymore (at least not in
any significant numbers).

Long-term investment with a single employer carries risks for the
employees: opportunity costs, skill stagnation or over-specialization,
far lower long-term compensation without internal "job hopping" up the
management ladder (and even then it's not nearly the risk-free move it
was even 20 years ago, let alone 30 or 40), etc. Employers don't
acknowledge these risks the employees take, though, and simply demand
loyalty without wanting to make an investment of their own other than a
begrudgingly given compensation package (that is often below the actual
value an employee provides).

Of course it's not fair; and that's just the way it is--it's something
serial entrepreneurs and "job hoppers" should just be prepared to deal
with.

 There's nothing wrong with self employment in and of itself. I've been
self employed for many years now, and this hasn't stopped me constantly
receiving jobs offers. Of course, I've also been employed for many years
before that, and that probably counts too.

I think self employment only looks bad when it's interspersed with very
small periods of employment, from a couple of months to six months.
Having long periods of unemployment, followed by short bursts of a
couple of months here, three months there could maybe be interpreted as
a sign that the candidate has a problem with keeping jobs, and that
there are probably good reasons for that.

Having only ever been self employed could also be seen as a bad sign.
Having never worked within a company, maybe the candidate has no
teamwork skills, cannot work within a hierarchy, cannot keep a fixed
schedule, etc.

I can't think of any other situations when self employment would look
bad.

 May I ask how employers are even finding out about you to give you

time and feel like employers are unaware that I even exist.

I'm going to guess your resume has a Google/Amazon/Facebook name brand
on it somewhere.

 LinkedIn and personal recommendations mostly. I have absolutely no
"name brands" on my resume (I stay well away of large companies
actually), but have a somewhat productive network I've nurtured over the
years, which is where I also get 90% of my freelance projects. I also
happen to live in Romania, where there's no way to go hungry if you are
an even remotely competent developer or other type of IT professional,
because the demand outweighs the supply by a huge margin here. Living in
the capital (Bucharest) also helps, since the vast majority of IT
companies have their offices here.

 I'm not self employed; I am a small business owner. Start a formal
business for consulting [or whatever].

That way you aren't self employed; you were employed at Sudorank LLC or
something similar.

I haven't maintained a personal resume/CV is years; and have no plans to
do so again. I do not share past client names with other potential
clients. Recruiters don't know how to handle me, however it hasn't hurt
my business.

For proof of skill people can review my books, articles, blog posts, or
StackOverflow profile.

I assume my first meetings with clients are very different than
interviews [although a few have had an interview-like feel].

 Good day to everybody

My name are Lynn Janet, I want to thank this great loan company who
helped me to get a loan. For the past three months, I have been
searching for a loan to settle my debts and also to start a business,
everyone i met scammed and took my money until i finally met Mr Gabriel
Owen. He was able to give me a loan of $330,000 dollars. He can also
help you with any amount of loan you wish to get. He has also helped
some other colleagues of mine. If you need any financial help, kindly
contact his company through email: (gabowenfinance@yahoo.com) i believe
they can help you. Contact him to get help just as he helped me. He does
not know that i am doing this by spreading his goodwill towards me but i
feel i should share this with you all to free yourself from spammers,
please beware of impersonators and contact the right loan company to get
any kind of loan of your choice.

 I'm trying to do the same after ten years of running a web agency. I
had some successes, but I also made plenty of mistakes along the way
since I was learning while doing. Ultimately I couldn't make it into a
viable business.

At first, it felt like a hindrance, a decade-long black dot that I
wanted to somehow hide. Now I'm proud of the period -- provided jobs,
mentored, made things, etc. -- so it is easier to talk about.

I'm not going the hide that period. I'm going to be frank about it once
I hit the streets. I made a lot of mistakes and learned a lot of hard
lessons, lessons that should help in whatever my new capacity is.

So I guess my advice is to be honest about those self-employed periods.
They are what they are.

 IMHO - which doesn't mean much, it's really a combination of industry
and geography. And of course, I fully realize that what I'm writing
below is based on generalizations that I've witnessed/experienced.

For example, here in Canada there's very little risk tolerance,
regardless of what people tell you. You see it in the ways companies
raise funds, are valued, and even the execution points. Being
'self-employed' can be a hindrance, especially in marketing. On the
other side 'Founding X company - building the overall business to over
$YY in revenue' is a positive spin on the same result.

On the other hand, discussing a project-based approach looks VERY good.
At that point you're a consultant, rather than a contractor or
freelancer. Here, that resonates better, in that people go 'ah, well
paid expert'. This in turn means that you can pivot the discussion
around to project successes, the values you've learned working on
multiple projects, etc.

But most importantly, don't underestimate the value of the cover letter
- which I used to believe no one reads. If you can explain your
*passion* to join organization X (for some specific reason), then
effectively you're priming your resume reader. That helps you positively
change the conversation - a brilliant technique from behavioral
economics.

Good luck!

 Despite my CV clearly stating that I'm self-employed, and which period
I've been self-employed, many recruiters still seem to think my own
company is someone else's company. I have no idea why.

In any case, it doesn't seem to cause any problems. I work as
freelancer, so it makes every kind of sense that I have my own company.

 I've been intern, employed, freelance, self-employed, founder,
consultant, and I haven't had any problem marketing myself. In fact, I
had an online profile in one of those job seeking sites, and I had to
take it off cos recruiters and headhunters were continuously calling me
with job offers (but I was happily self-employed as stated in the CV!).

I think it is more about your achieved goals, projects and skills, and
less about who have you been working for. If I were you, I'd just
concentrate my efforts in building projects where you show off your
skills (blog/portfolio, github, etc...). IMO this can be more powerful
than a CV.

 Of course I added it to my resume! All the companies I interviewed at
(all small companies of <10 people though) thought it was a huge bonus
for me. Even though I'm only a medior developer I have proven that I can
work independently and responsibly. It also gave me a lot of cool
projects to show.

That's how I did it; I just demo'd them the coolest apps I built and
explained why they were cool (google tweeted about it, won the imagine
cup with it, got covered by major news sites, etc.).

 I'd create it around the job that you're trying to get. If an employer
is looking for a candidate, often the don't have the time to look deeply
into each resume coming in.

If your resume has traits that stand out for the position available,
it'll catch the employers eye and increase your chances of getting an
interview.

I'd recommend writing about projects you did that relate to the job
posting combined with measurable facts about the results.

Hope that helps!

 For me, as a programmer, having a (1 employee = me) business / being
self-employed alongside my study and some jobs has helped in building my
CV.

On one hand it gave me a lot of first-hand experience with a lot of
things, and second it shows that i'm not keen on sitting on my hands.

 Sure you would - maybe not for cold calling new prospects, but when I
was doing consulting, I would get asked for my resume as part of my
potential customer's due diligence process on me.

And those people would actually read it, because they already knew me
and were trying to understand my background to decide whether or not to
bring me on to a project. Unlike recruiters or hiring managers who are
often just looking for a reason to throw a resume in the trash to thin
out their crowd of applicants.

 been dealing with this for a long long time. Until I learned how to
fudge a resume or CV correctly(doesn't take much effort), I really
struggled and lost out to what I called the, "certified stupid", or "the
Educated/indoctrinated incompetents". Take a google search through
people busted for fake CV's, many of whom held VERY high positions at
prestigious Universities yet it took decades and decades to catch the
few who've been caught. And we have a commander in chief who's 'cv' is
either false, or the biggest joke in history. So my friend, plan ahead,
purchase a number of throwaway cellphones(TracPhones are less than $5!)
and label each with a name, company, gender, etc. and use those for your
'references'. Depending on what kind of work you seek you may also want
to research what people who left jobs under a NDA have to do when trying
to list previous work experience.
