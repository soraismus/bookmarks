Salted Password Hashing - Doing it Right
========================================

If you're a web developer, you've probably had to make a user account
system. The most important aspect of a user account system is how user
passwords are protected. User account databases are hacked frequently,
so you absolutely must do something to protect your users' passwords if
your website is ever breached. The best way to protect passwords is to
employ **salted password hashing**. This page will explain how to do it
properly.

There are a lot of conflicting ideas and misconceptions on how to do
password hashing properly, probably due to the abundance of
misinformation on the web. Password hashing is one of those things
that's so simple, but yet so many people get wrong. With this page, I
hope to explain not only the correct way to do it, but why it should be
done that way.

What is password hashing?
-------------------------

hash("hello") =
2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824\
 hash("hbllo") =
58756879c05c68dfac9866712fad6a93f8146f337a69afe7dd238f3364946366\
 hash("waltz") =
c0e81794384491161f1777c232bc6bd9ec38f616560b120fda8e90f383853542\

Hash algorithms are one way functions. They turn any amount of data into
a fixed-length "fingerprint" that cannot be reversed. They also have the
property that if the input changes by even a tiny bit, the resulting
hash is completely different (see the example above). This is great for
protecting passwords, because we want to store passwords in an encrypted
form that's impossible to decrypt, but at the same time, we need to be
able to verify that a user's password is correct.

The general workflow for account registration and authentication in a
hash-based account system is as follows:

1.  The user creates an account.
2.  Their password is hashed and stored in the database. At no point is
    the plain-text (unencrypted) password ever written to the hard
    drive.
3.  When the user attempts to login, the hash of the password they
    entered is checked against the hash of their real password
    (retrieved from the database).
4.  If the hashes match, the user is granted access. If not, the user is
    told they entered invalid login credentials.
5.  Steps 3 and 4 repeat everytime someone tries to login to their
    account.

In step 4, never tell the user if it was the username or password they
got wrong. Always display a generic message like "Invalid username or
password." This prevents attackers from enumerating valid usernames
without knowing their passwords.

It should be noted that the hash functions used to protect passwords are
not the same as the hash functions you may have seen in a data
structures course. The hash functions used to implement data structures
such as hash tables are designed to be fast, not secure. Only
**cryptographic hash functions** may be used to implement password
hashing. Hash functions like SHA256, SHA512, RipeMD, and WHIRLPOOL are
cryptographic hash functions.

It is easy to think that all you have to do is run the password through
a cryptographic hash function and your users' passwords will be secure.
This is far from the truth. There are many ways to recover passwords
from plain hashes very quickly. There are several easy-to-implement
techniques that make these "attacks" much less effective. To motivate
the need for these techniques, consider this very website. On the front
page, you can submit a list of hashes to be cracked, and receive results
in less than a second. Clearly, simply hashing the password does not
meet our needs for security.

The next section will discuss some of the common attacks used to crack
plain password hashes.

How Hashes are Cracked
----------------------

-   ### Dictionary and Brute Force Attacks

    Dictionary Attack

    \
     Trying apple : failed\
     Trying blueberry : failed\
     Trying justinbeiber : failed\

    ...

    Trying letmein : failed\
     Trying s3cr3t : success!\

    Brute Force Attack

    \
     Trying aaaa : failed\
     Trying aaab : failed\
     Trying aaac : failed\

    ...

    Trying acdb : failed\
     Trying acdc : success!\

    The simplest way to crack a hash is to try to guess the password,
    hashing each guess, and checking if the guess's hash equals the hash
    being cracked. If the hashes are equal, the guess is the password.
    The two most common ways of guessing passwords are **dictionary
    attacks** and **brute-force attacks**.

    A dictionary attack uses a file containing words, phrases, common
    passwords, and other strings that are likely to be used as a
    password. Each word in the file is hashed, and its hash is compared
    to the password hash. If they match, that word is the password.
    These dictionary files are constructed by extracting words from
    large bodies of text, and even from real databases of passwords.
    Further processing is often applied to dictionary files, such as
    replacing words with their "leet speak" equivalents ("hello" becomes
    "h3110"), to make them more effective.

    A brute-force attack tries every possible combination of characters
    up to a given length. These attacks are very computationally
    expensive, and are usually the least efficient in terms of hashes
    cracked per processor time, but they will always eventually find the
    password. Passwords should be long enough that searching through all
    possible character strings to find it will take too long to be
    worthwhile.

    There is no way to prevent dictionary attacks or brute force
    attacks. They can be made less effective, but there isn't a way to
    prevent them altogether. If your password hashing system is secure,
    the only way to crack the hashes will be to run a dictionary or
    brute-force attack on each hash.

-   ### Lookup Tables

    Searching: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99: FOUND: password5\
     Searching: 6cbe615c106f422d23669b610b564800: not in database\
     Searching: 630bf032efe4507f2c57b280995925a9: FOUND: letMEin12 \
     Searching: 386f43fab5d096a7a66d67c8f213e5ec: FOUND: mcd0nalds\
     Searching: d5ec75d5fe70d428685510fae36492d9: FOUND: p@ssw0rd!\

    Lookup tables are an extremely effective method for cracking many
    hashes of the same type very quickly. The general idea is to
    **pre-compute** the hashes of the passwords in a password dictionary
    and store them, and their corresponding password, in a lookup table
    data structure. A good implementation of a lookup table can process
    hundreds of hash lookups per second, even when they contain many
    billions of hashes.

    If you want a better idea of how fast lookup tables can be, try
    cracking the following sha256 hashes with CrackStation's [free hash
    cracker](/).

    c11083b4b0a7743af748c85d343dfee9fbb8b2576c05f3a7f0d632b0926aadfc\

     5206b8b8a996cf5320cb12ca91c7b790fba9f030408efe83ebb83548dc3007bd\

-   ### Reverse Lookup Tables

    Searching for hash(apple) in users' hash list... : Matches [alice3,
    0bob0, charles8]\
     Searching for hash(blueberry) in users' hash list... : Matches
    [usr10101, timmy, john91]\
     Searching for hash(letmein) in users' hash list... : Matches
    [wilson10, dragonslayerX, joe1984]\
     Searching for hash(s3cr3t) in users' hash list... : Matches
    [bruce19, knuth1337, john87]\
     Searching for hash(z@29hjja) in users' hash list... : No users used
    this password\

    This attack allows an attacker to apply a dictionary or brute-force
    attack to many hashes at the same time, without having to
    pre-compute a lookup table.

    First, the attacker creates a lookup table that maps each password
    hash from the compromised user account database to a list of users
    who had that hash. The attacker then hashes each password guess and
    uses the lookup table to get a list of users whose password was the
    attacker's guess. This attack is especially effective because it is
    common for many users to have the same password.

-   ### Rainbow Tables

    Rainbow tables are a time-memory trade-off technique. They are like
    lookup tables, except that they sacrifice hash cracking speed to
    make the lookup tables smaller. Because they are smaller, the
    solutions to more hashes can be stored in the same amount of space,
    making them more effective. Rainbow tables that can crack any md5
    hash of a password up to 8 characters long
    [exist](http://www.freerainbowtables.com/en/tables2/).

Next, we'll look at a technique called salting, which makes it
impossible to use lookup tables and rainbow tables to crack a hash.

Adding Salt
-----------

hash("hello") =
2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824\
 hash("hello" + "QxLUF1bgIAdeQX") =
9e209040c863f84a31e719795b2577523954739fe5ed3b58a75cff2127075ed1\
 hash("hello" + "bv5PehSMfV11Cd") =
d1d3ec2e6f20fd420d50e2642992841d8338a314b8ea157c9e18477aaef226ab\
 hash("hello" + "YYLmfY6IehjZMQ") =
a49670c3c18b9e079b9cfaf51634f563dc8ae3070db2c4a8544305df1b60f007

Lookup tables and rainbow tables only work because each password is
hashed the exact same way. If two users have the same password, they'll
have the same password hashes. We can prevent these attacks by
randomizing each hash, so that when the same password is hashed twice,
the hashes are not the same.

We can randomize the hashes by appending or prepending a random string,
called a **salt**, to the password before hashing. As shown in the
example above, this makes the same password hash into a completely
different string every time. To check if a password is correct, we need
the salt, so it is usually stored in the user account database along
with the hash, or as part of the hash string itself.

The salt does not need to be secret. Just by randomizing the hashes,
lookup tables, reverse lookup tables, and rainbow tables become
ineffective. An attacker won't know in advance what the salt will be, so
they can't pre-compute a lookup table or rainbow table. If each user's
password is hashed with a different salt, the reverse lookup table
attack won't work either.

In the next section, we'll look at how salt is commonly implemented
incorrectly.

The WRONG Way: Short Salt & Salt Reuse
--------------------------------------

The most common salt implementation errors are reusing the same salt in
multiple hashes, or using a salt that is too short.

### Salt Reuse

A common mistake is to use the same salt in each hash. Either the salt
is hard-coded into the program, or is generated randomly once. This is
ineffective because if two users have the same password, they'll still
have the same hash. An attacker can still use a reverse lookup table
attack to run a dictionary attack on every hash at the same time. They
just have to apply the salt to each password guess before they hash it.
If the salt is hard-coded into a popular product, lookup tables and
rainbow tables can be built for that salt, to make it easier to crack
hashes generated by the product.

A new random salt must be generated each time a user creates an account
or changes their password.

### Short Salt

If the salt is too short, an attacker can build a lookup table for every
possible salt. For example, if the salt is only three ASCII characters,
there are only 95x95x95 = 857,375 possible salts. That may seem like a
lot, but if each lookup table contains only 1MB of the most common
passwords, collectively they will be only 837GB, which is not a lot
considering 1000GB hard drives can be bought for under $100 today.

For the same reason, the username shouldn't be used as a salt. Usernames
may be unique to a single service, but they are predictable and often
reused for accounts on other services. An attacker can build lookup
tables for common usernames and use them to crack username-salted
hashes.

To make it impossible for an attacker to create a lookup table for every
possible salt, the salt must be long. A good rule of thumb is to use a
salt that is the same size as the output of the hash function. For
example, the output of SHA256 is 256 bits (32 bytes), so the salt should
be at least 32 random bytes.

The WRONG Way: Double Hashing & Wacky Hash Functions
----------------------------------------------------

This section covers another common password hashing misconception: wacky
combinations of hash algorithms. It's easy to get carried away and try
to combine different hash functions, hoping that the result will be more
secure. In practice, though, there is very little benefit to doing it.
All it does is create interoperability problems, and can sometimes even
make the hashes less secure. Never try to invent your own crypto, always
use a standard that has been designed by experts. Some will argue that
using multiple hash functions makes the process of computing the hash
slower, so cracking is slower, but there's a better way to make the
cracking process slower as we'll see later.

Here are some examples of poor wacky hash functions I've seen suggested
in forums on the internet.

-   md5(sha1(password))
-   md5(md5(salt) + md5(password))
-   sha1(sha1(password))
-   sha1(str\_rot13(password + salt))
-   md5(sha1(md5(md5(password) + sha1(password)) + md5(password)))

Do not use any of these.

Note: This section has proven to be controversial. I've received a
number of emails arguing that wacky hash functions are a good thing,
because it's better if the attacker doesn't know which hash function is
in use, it's less likely for an attacker to have pre-computed a rainbow
table for the wacky hash function, and it takes longer to compute the
hash function.

An attacker cannot attack a hash when he doesn't know the algorithm, but
note [Kerckhoffs's
principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle), that
the attacker will usually have access to the source code (especially if
it's free or open source software), and that given a few password-hash
pairs from the target system, it is not difficult to reverse engineer
the algorithm. It does take longer to compute wacky hash functions, but
only by a small constant factor. It's better to use an iterated
algorithm that's designed to be extremely hard to parallelize (these are
discussed below). And, properly salting the hash solves the rainbow
table problem.

If you really want to use a standardized "wacky" hash function like
HMAC, then it's OK. But if your reason for doing so is to make the hash
computation slower, read the section below about key stretching first.

Compare these minor benefits to the risks of accidentally implementing a
completely insecure hash function and the interoperability problems
wacky hashes create. It's clearly best to use a standard and well-tested
algorithm.

Hash Collisions
---------------

Because hash functions map arbitrary amounts of data to fixed-length
strings, there must be some inputs that hash into the same string.
Cryptographic hash functions are designed to make these collisions
incredibly difficult to find. From time to time, cryptographers find
"attacks" on hash functions that make finding collisions easier. A
recent example is the MD5 hash function, for which collisions have
actually been found.

Collision attacks are a sign that it may be more likely for a string
other than the user's password to have the same hash. However, finding
collisions in even a weak hash function like MD5 requires a lot of
dedicated computing power, so it is very unlikely that these collisions
will happen "by accident" in practice. A password hashed using MD5 and
salt is, for all practical purposes, just as secure as if it were hashed
with SHA256 and salt. Nevertheless, it is a good idea to use a more
secure hash function like SHA256, SHA512, RipeMD, or WHIRLPOOL if
possible.

The RIGHT Way: How to Hash Properly
-----------------------------------

This section describes exactly how passwords should be hashed. The first
subsection covers the basics—everything that is absolutely necessary.
The following subsections explain how the basics can be augmented to
make the hashes even harder to crack.

### The Basics: Hashing with Salt

**Warning: Do not just read this section. You absolutely must implement
the stuff in the next section: "Making Password Cracking Harder: Slow
Hash Functions".**

We've seen how malicious hackers can crack plain hashes very quickly
using lookup tables and rainbow tables. We've learned that randomizing
the hashing using salt is the solution to the problem. But how do we
generate the salt, and how do we apply it to the password?

Salt should be generated using a **Cryptographically Secure
Pseudo-Random Number Generator** (CSPRNG). CSPRNGs are very different
than ordinary pseudo-random number generators, like the "C" language's
rand() function. As the name suggests, CSPRNGs are designed to be
cryptographically secure, meaning they provide a high level of
randomness and are completely unpredictable. We don't want our salts to
be predictable, so we must use a CSPRNG. The following table lists some
CSPRNGs that exist for some popular programming platforms.

  Platform                            CSPRNG
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Any language on GNU/Linux or Unix   Read from [/dev/random](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random) or /dev/urandom

The salt needs to be unique per-user per-password. Every time a user
creates an account or changes their password, the password should be
hashed using a new random salt. Never reuse a salt. The salt also needs
to be long, so that there are many possible salts. As a rule of thumb,
make your salt is at least as long as the hash function's output. The
salt should be stored in the user account table alongside the hash.

#### To Store a Password

1.  Generate a long random salt using a CSPRNG.
2.  Prepend the salt to the password and hash it with a **standard**
    cryptographic hash function such as SHA256.
3.  Save both the salt and the hash in the user's database record.

#### To Validate a Password

1.  Retrieve the user's salt and hash from the database.
2.  Prepend the salt to the given password and hash it using the same
    hash function.
3.  Compare the hash of the given password with the hash from the
    database. If they match, the password is correct. Otherwise, the
    password is incorrect.

At the bottom of this page, there are implementations of salted password
hashing in [PHP](#phpsourcecode), [C\#](#aspsourcecode),
[Java](#javasourcecode), and [Ruby](#rubysourcecode).

#### In a Web Application, **always** hash on the server

If you are writing a web application, you might wonder *where* to hash.
Should the password be hashed in the user's browser with JavaScript, or
should it be sent to the server "in the clear" and hashed there?

Even if you are hashing the user's passwords in JavaScript, you still
have to hash the hashes on the server. Consider a website that hashes
users' passwords in the user's browser without hashing the hashes on the
server. To authenticate a user, this website will accept a hash from the
browser and check if that hash exactly matches the one in the database.
This seems more secure than just hashing on the server, since the users'
passwords are never sent to the server, but it's not.

The problem is that the client-side hash logically *becomes* the user's
password. All the user needs to do to authenticate is tell the server
the hash of their password. If a bad guy got a user's *hash* they could
use it to authenticate to the server, without knowing the user's
password! So, if the bad guy somehow steals the database of hashes from
this hypothetical website, they'll have immediate access to everyone's
accounts without having to guess any passwords.

This isn't to say that you *shouldn't* hash in the browser, but if you
do, you absolutely have to hash on the server too. Hashing in the
browser is certainly a good idea, but consider the following points for
your implementation:

-   Client-side password hashing is **not** a substitute for HTTPS
    (SSL/TLS). If the connection between the browser and the server is
    insecure, a man-in-the-middle can modify the JavaScript code as it
    is downloaded to remove the hashing functionality and get the user's
    password.

-   Some web browsers don't support JavaScript, and some users disable
    JavaScript in their browser. So for maximum compatibility, your app
    should detect whether or not the browser supports JavaScript and
    emulate the client-side hash on the server if it doesn't.

-   You need to salt the client-side hashes too. The obvious solution is
    to make the client-side script ask the server for the user's salt.
    Don't do that, because it lets the bad guys check if a username is
    valid without knowing the password. Since you're hashing and salting
    (with a good salt) on the server too, it's OK to use the username
    (or email) concatenated with a site-specific string (e.g. domain
    name) as the client-side salt.

### Making Password Cracking Harder: Slow Hash Functions

Salt ensures that attackers can't use specialized attacks like lookup
tables and rainbow tables to crack large collections of hashes quickly,
but it doesn't prevent them from running dictionary or brute-force
attacks on each hash individually. High-end graphics cards (GPUs) and
custom hardware can compute billions of hashes per second, so these
attacks are still very effective. To make these attacks less effective,
we can use a technique known as **key stretching**.

The idea is to make the hash function very slow, so that even with a
fast GPU or custom hardware, dictionary and brute-force attacks are too
slow to be worthwhile. The goal is to make the hash function slow enough
to impede attacks, but still fast enough to not cause a noticeable delay
for the user.

Key stretching is implemented using a special type of CPU-intensive hash
function. Don't try to invent your own–simply iteratively hashing the
hash of the password isn't enough as it can be parallelized in hardware
and executed as fast as a normal hash. Use a standard algorithm like
[PBKDF2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) or
[bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt). You can find a PHP
implementation of [PBKDF2 here](https://defuse.ca/php-pbkdf2.htm).

These algorithms take a security factor or iteration count as an
argument. This value determines how slow the hash function will be. For
desktop software or smartphone apps, the best way to choose this
parameter is to run a short benchmark on the device to find the value
that makes the hash take about half a second. This way, your program can
be as secure as possible without affecting the user experience.

If you use a key stretching hash in a web application, be aware that you
will need extra computational resources to process large volumes of
authentication requests, and that key stretching may make it easier to
run a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on your website. I still recommend
using key stretching, but with a lower iteration count. You should
calculate the iteration count based on your computational resources and
the expected maximum authentication request rate. The denial of service
threat can be eliminated by making the user solve a CAPTCHA every time
they log in. Always design your system so that the iteration count can
be increased or decreased in the future.

If you are worried about the computational burden, but still want to use
key stretching in a web application, consider running the key stretching
algorithm in the user's browser with JavaScript. The [Stanford
JavaScript Crypto Library](http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/) includes
PBKDF2. The iteration count should be set low enough that the system is
usable with slower clients like mobile devices, and the system should
fall back to server-side computation if the user's browser doesn't
support JavaScript. Client-side key stretching does not remove the need
for server-side hashing. You must hash the hash generated by the client
the same way you would hash a normal password.

### Impossible-to-crack Hashes: Keyed Hashes and Password Hashing Hardware

As long as an attacker can use a hash to check whether a password guess
is right or wrong, they can run a dictionary or brute-force attack on
the hash. The next step is to add a **secret key** to the hash so that
only someone who knows the key can use the hash to validate a password.
This can be accomplished two ways. Either the hash can be encrypted
using a cipher like AES, or the secret key can be included in the hash
using a keyed hash algorithm like
[HMAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC).

This is not as easy as it sounds. The key has to be kept secret from an
attacker even in the event of a breach. If an attacker gains full access
to the system, they'll be able to steal the key no matter where it is
stored. The key must be stored in an external system, such as a
physically separate server dedicated to password validation, or a
special hardware device attached to the server such as the
[YubiHSM](https://www.yubico.com/YubiHSM).

I highly recommend this approach for any large scale (more than 100,000
users) service. I consider it necessary for any service hosting more
than 1,000,000 user accounts.

If you can't afford multiple dedicated servers or special hardware
devices, you can still get some of the benefits of keyed hashes on a
standard web server. Most databases are breached using [SQL Injection
Attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection), which, in most
cases, don't give attackers access to the local filesystem (disable
local filesystem access in your SQL server if it has this feature). If
you generate a random key and store it in a file that isn't accessible
from the web, and include it into the salted hashes, then the hashes
won't be vulnerable if your database is breached using a simple SQL
injection attack. Don't hard-code a key into the source code, generate
it randomly when the application is installed. This isn't as secure as
using a separate system to do the password hashing, because if there are
SQL injection vulnerabilities in a web application, there are probably
other types, such as Local File Inclusion, that an attacker could use to
read the secret key file. But, it's better than nothing.

Please note that keyed hashes do not remove the need for salt. Clever
attackers will eventually find ways to compromise the keys, so it is
important that hashes are still protected by salt and key stretching.

Other Security Measures
-----------------------

Password hashing protects passwords in the event of a security breach.
It does not make the application as a whole more secure. Much more must
be done to prevent the password hashes (and other user data) from being
stolen in the first place.

Even experienced developers must be educated in security in order to
write secure applications. A great resource for learning about web
application vulnerabilities is [The Open Web Application Security
Project (OWASP)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page). A good
introduction is the [OWASP Top Ten Vulnerability
List](http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202010.pdf).
Unless you understand all the vulnerabilities on the list, do not
attempt to write a web application that deals with sensitive data. It is
the employer's responsibility to ensure all developers are adequately
trained in secure application development.

Having a third party "penetration test" your application is a good idea.
Even the best programmers make mistakes, so it always makes sense to
have a security expert review the code for potential vulnerabilities.
Find a trustworthy organization (or hire staff) to review your code on a
regular basis. The security review process should begin early in an
application's life and continue throughout its development.

It is also important to monitor your website to detect a breach if one
does occur. I recommend hiring at least one person whose full time job
is detecting and responding to security breaches. If a breach goes
undetected, the attacker can make your website infect visitors with
malware, so it is extremely important that breaches are detected and
responded to promptly.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### What hash algorithm should I use?

**DO** use:

-   The [PHP source
    code](#phpsourcecode "PHP password hashing source code"), [Java
    source code](#javasourcecode "Java password hashing source code"),
    [C\# source code](#aspsourcecode "C# password hashing source code")
    or the [Ruby source
    code](#aspsourcecode "Ruby password hashing source code") at the
    bottom of this page.
-   OpenWall's [Portable PHP password hashing
    framework](http://www.openwall.com/phpass/)
-   Any modern well-tested cryptographic hash algorithm, such as SHA256,
    SHA512, RipeMD, WHIRLPOOL, SHA3, etc.
-   Well-designed key stretching algorithms such as
    [PBKDF2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2),
    [bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt), and
    [scrypt](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html).
-   Secure versions of
    [crypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(Unix)#Library_Function_crypt.283.29)
    ($2y$, $5$, $6$)

\
 **DO NOT** use:

-   Outdated hash functions like MD5 or SHA1.
-   Insecure versions of crypt ($1$, $2$, $2x$, $3$).
-   Any algorithm that you designed yourself. Only use technology that
    is in the public domain and has been well-tested by experienced
    cryptographers.

Even though there are no cryptographic attacks on MD5 or SHA1 that make
their hashes easier to crack, they are old and are widely considered
(somewhat incorrectly) to be inadequate for password storage. So I don't
recommend using them. An exception to this rule is PBKDF2, which is
frequently implemented using SHA1 as the underlying hash function.

### How should I allow users to reset their password when they forget it?

It is my personal opinion that all password reset mechanisms in
widespread use today are insecure. If you have high security
requirements, such as an encryption service would, do not let the user
reset their password.

Most websites use an email loop to authenticate users who have forgotten
their password. To do this, generate a random **single-use** token that
is strongly tied to the account. Include it in a password reset link
sent to the user's email address. When the user clicks a password reset
link containing a valid token, prompt them for a new password. Be sure
that the token is strongly tied to the user account so that an attacker
can't use a token sent to his own email address to reset a different
user's password.

The token must be set to expire in 15 minutes or after it is used,
whichever comes first. It is also a good idea to expire any existing
password tokens when the user logs in (they remembered their password)
or requests another reset token. If a token doesn't expire, it can be
forever used to break into the user's account. Email (SMTP) is a
plain-text protocol, and there may be malicious routers on the internet
recording email traffic. And, a user's email account (including the
reset link) may be compromised long after their password has been
changed. Making the token expire as soon as possible reduces the user's
exposure to these attacks.

Attackers will be able to modify the tokens, so don't store the user
account information or timeout information in them. They should be an
unpredictable random binary blob used only to identify a record in a
database table.

Never send the user a new password over email. Remember to pick a new
random salt when the user resets their password. Don't re-use the one
that was used to hash their old password.

### What should I do if my user account database gets leaked/hacked?

Your first priority is to determine how the system was compromised and
patch the vulnerability the attacker used to get in. If you do not have
experience responding to breaches, I highly recommend hiring a
third-party security firm.

It may be tempting to cover up the breach and hope nobody notices.
However, trying to cover up a breach makes you look worse, because
you're putting your users at further risk by not informing them that
their passwords and other personal information may be compromised. You
must inform your users as soon as possible—even if you don't yet fully
understand what happened. Put a notice on the front page of your website
that links to a page with more detailed information, and send a notice
to each user by email if possible.

Explain to your users exactly how their passwords were
protected—hopefully hashed with salt—and that even though they were
protected with a salted hash, a malicious hacker can still run
dictionary and brute force attacks on the hashes. Malicious hackers will
use any passwords they find to try to login to a user's account on a
different website, hoping they used the same password on both websites.
Inform your users of this risk and recommend that they change their
password on any website or service where they used a similar password.
Force them to change their password for your service the next time they
log in. Most users will try to "change" their password to the original
password to get around the forced change quickly. Use the current
password hash to ensure that they cannot do this.

It is likely, even with salted slow hashes, that an attacker will be
able to crack some of the weak passwords very quickly. To reduce the
attacker's window of opportunity to use these passwords, you should
require, in addition to the current password, an email loop for
authentication until the user has changed their password. See the
previous question, "How should I allow users to reset their password
when they forget it?" for tips on implementing email loop
authentication.

Also tell your users what kind of personal information was stored on the
website. If your database includes credit card numbers, you should
instruct your users to look over their recent and future bills closely
and cancel their credit card.

### What should my password policy be? Should I enforce strong passwords?

If your service doesn't have strict security requirements, then don't
limit your users. I recommend showing users information about the
strength of their password as they type it, letting them decide how
secure they want their password to be. If you have special security
needs, enforce a minimum length of 12 characters and require at least
two letters, two digits, and two symbols.

Do not force your users to change their password more often than once
every six months, as doing so creates "user fatigue" and makes users
less likely to choose good passwords. Instead, train users to change
their password whenever they feel it has been compromised, and to never
tell their password to anyone. If it is a business setting, encourage
employees to use paid time to memorize and practice their password.

### If an attacker has access to my database, can't they just replace the hash of my password with their own hash and login?

Yes, but if someone has accesss to your database, they probably already
have access to everything on your server, so they wouldn't need to login
to your account to get what they want. The purpose of password hashing
(in the context of a website) is not to protect the website from being
breached, but to protect the passwords if a breach does occur.

You can prevent hashes from being replaced during a SQL injection attack
by connecting to the database with two users with different permissions.
One for the 'create account' code and one for the 'login' code. The
'create account' code should be able to read and write to the user
table, but the 'login' code should only be able to read.

### Why do I have to use a special algorithm like HMAC? Why can't I just append the password to the secret key?

Hash functions like MD5, SHA1, and SHA2 use the [Merkle–Damgård
construction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction),
which makes them vulnerable to what are known as length extension
attacks. This means that given a hash H(X), an attacker can find the
value of H(pad(X) + Y), for any other string Y, without knowing X.
pad(X) is the padding function used by the hash.

This means that given a hash H(key + message), an attacker can compute
H(pad(key + message) + extension), without knowing the key. If the hash
was being used as a message authentication code, using the key to
prevent an attacker from being able to modify the message and replace it
with a different valid hash, the system has failed, since the attacker
now has a valid hash of message + extension.

It is not clear how an attacker could use this attack to crack a
password hash quicker. However, because of the attack, it is considered
bad practice to use a plain hash function for keyed hashing. A clever
cryptographer may one day come up with a clever way to use these attacks
to make cracking faster, so use HMAC.

### Should the salt come before or after the password?

It doesn't matter, but pick one and stick with it for interoperability's
sake. Having the salt come before the password seems to be more common.

### Why does the hashing code on this page compare the hashes in "length-constant" time?

Comparing the hashes in "length-constant" time ensures that an attacker
cannot extract the hash of a password in an on-line system using a
timing attack, then crack it off-line.

The standard way to check if two sequences of bytes (strings) are the
same is to compare the first byte, then the second, then the third, and
so on. As soon as you find a byte that isn't the same for both strings,
you know they are different and can return a negative response
immediately. If you make it through both strings without finding any
bytes that differ, you know the strings are the same and can return a
positive result. This means that comparing two strings can take a
different amount of time depending on how much of the strings match.

For example, a standard comparison of the strings "xyzabc" and "abcxyz"
would immediately see that the first character is different and wouldn't
bother to check the rest of the string. On the other hand, when the
strings "aaaaaaaaaaB" and "aaaaaaaaaaZ" are compared, the comparison
algorithm scans through the block of "a" before it determins the strings
are unequal.

Suppose an attacker wants to break into an on-line system that rate
limits authentication attempts to one attempt per second. Also suppose
the attacker knows all of the parameters to the password hash (salt,
hash type, etc), except for the hash and (obviously) the password. If
the attacker can get a precisise measurement of how long it takes the
on-line system to compare the hash of the real password with the hash of
a password the attacker provides, he can use the timing attack to
extract part of the hash and crack it using an offline attack, bypassing
the system's rate limiting.

First, the attacker finds 256 strings whose hashes begin with every
possible byte. He sends each string to the on-line system, recording the
amount of time it takes the system to respond. The string that takes the
longest will be the one whose hash's first byte matches the real hash's
first byte. The attacker now knows the first byte, and can continue the
attack in a similar manner on the second byte, then the third, and so
on. Once the attacker knows enough of the hash, he can use his own
hardware to crack it, without being rate limited by the system.

It might seem like it would be impossible to run a timing attack over a
network. However, it has been done, and has been [shown to be
practical](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/ssl-timing.pdf).
That's why the code on this page compares strings in a way that takes
the same amount of time no matter how much of the strings match.

### How does the SlowEquals code work?

The previous question explains why SlowEquals is necessary, this one
explains how the code actually works.

\1. private static boolean slowEquals(byte[] a, byte[] b)\
 2. {\
 3. int diff = a.length \^ b.length;\
 4. for(int i = 0; i < a.length && i < b.length; i++)\
 5. diff |= a[i] \^ b[i];\
 6. return diff == 0;\
 7. }\

The code uses the XOR "\^" operator to compare integers for equality,
instead of the "==" operator. The reason why is explained below. The
result of XORing two integers will be zero if and only if they are
exactly the same. This is because 0 XOR 0 = 0, 1 XOR 1 = 0, 0 XOR 1 = 1,
1 XOR 0 = 1. If we apply that to all the bits in both integers, the
result will be zero only if all the bits matched.

So, in the first line, if `a.length` is equal to `b.length`, the diff
variable will get a zero value, but if not, it will get some non-zero
value. Next, we compare the bytes using XOR, and OR the result into
diff. This will set diff to a non-zero value if the bytes differ.
Because ORing never un-sets bits, the only way diff will be zero at the
end of the loop is if it was zero before the loop began (a.length ==
b.length) and all of the bytes in the two arrays match (none of the XORs
resulted in a non-zero value).

The reason we need to use XOR instead of the "==" operator to compare
integers is that "==" is usually translated/compiled/interpreted as a
branch. For example, the C code "`diff &= a == b`" might compile to the
following x86 assembly:

MOV EAX, [A]\
 CMP [B], EAX\
 JZ equal\
 JMP done\
 equal:\
 AND [VALID], 1\
 done:\
 AND [VALID], 0\

The branching makes the code execute in a different amount of time
depending on the equality of the integers and the CPU's internal branch
prediction state.

The C code "`diff |= a ^ b`" should compile to something like the
following, whose execution time does not depend on the equality of the
integers:

MOV EAX, [A]\
 XOR EAX, [B]\
 OR [DIFF], EAX \

### Why bother hashing?

Your users are entering their password into your website. They are
trusting you with their security. If your database gets hacked, and your
users' passwords are unprotected, then malicious hackers can use those
passwords to compromise your users' accounts on other websites and
services (most people use the same password everywhere). It's not just
your security that's at risk, it's your users'. You are responsible for
your users' security.
