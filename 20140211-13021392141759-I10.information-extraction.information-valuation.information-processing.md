*As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr.
Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six thousand
leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. In
this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when
the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn
to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of
knowledge. For years inventions have extended man's physical powers
rather than the powers of his mind. Trip hammers that multiply the
fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and
detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science.
Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly
developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited
knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments
should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from
their war work. Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on "The American
Scholar," this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between
thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. —THE EDITOR*

This has not been a scientist's war; it has been a war in which all have
had a part. The scientists, burying their old professional competition
in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and learned much.
It has been exhilarating to work in effective partnership. Now, for
many, this appears to be approaching an end. What are the scientists to
do next?

For the biologists, and particularly for the medical scientists, there
can be little indecision, for their war has hardly required them to
leave the old paths. Many indeed have been able to carry on their war
research in their familiar peacetime laboratories. Their objectives
remain much the same.

It is the physicists who have been thrown most violently off stride, who
have left academic pursuits for the making of strange destructive
gadgets, who have had to devise new methods for their unanticipated
assignments. They have done their part on the devices that made it
possible to turn back the enemy, have worked in combined effort with the
physicists of our allies. They have felt within themselves the stir of
achievement. They have been part of a great team. Now, as peace
approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy of their
best.

Of what lasting benefit has been man's use of science and of the new
instruments which his research brought into existence? First, they have
increased his control of his material environment. They have improved
his food, his clothing, his shelter; they have increased his security
and released him partly from the bondage of bare existence. They have
given him increased knowledge of his own biological processes so that he
has had a progressive freedom from disease and an increased span of
life. They are illuminating the interactions of his physiological and
psychological functions, giving the promise of an improved mental
health.

Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it
has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to
make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures
throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual.

There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence
that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The
investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands
of other workers—conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much
less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization becomes
increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between
disciplines is correspondingly superficial.

Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results of
research are generations old and by now are totally inadequate for their
purpose. If the aggregate time spent in writing scholarly works and in
reading them could be evaluated, the ratio between these amounts of time
might well be startling. Those who conscientiously attempt to keep
abreast of current thought, even in restricted fields, by close and
continuous reading might well shy away from an examination calculated to
show how much of the previous month's efforts could be produced on call.
Mendel's concept of the laws of genetics was lost to the world for a
generation because his publication did not reach the few who were
capable of grasping and extending it; and this sort of catastrophe is
undoubtedly being repeated all about us, as truly significant
attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential.

The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view
of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that
publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make
real use of the record. The summation of human experience is being
expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading
through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the
same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships.

But there are signs of a change as new and powerful instrumentalities
come into use. Photocells capable of seeing things in a physical sense,
advanced photography which can record what is seen or even what is not,
thermionic tubes capable of controlling potent forces under the guidance
of less power than a mosquito uses to vibrate his wings, cathode ray
tubes rendering visible an occurrence so brief that by comparison a
microsecond is a long time, relay combinations which will carry out
involved sequences of movements more reliably than any human operator
and thousands of times as fast—there are plenty of mechanical aids with
which to effect a transformation in scientific records.

Two centuries ago Leibnitz invented a calculating machine which embodied
most of the essential features of recent keyboard devices, but it could
not then come into use. The economics of the situation were against it:
the labor involved in constructing it, before the days of mass
production, exceeded the labor to be saved by its use, since all it
could accomplish could be duplicated by sufficient use of pencil and
paper. Moreover, it would have been subject to frequent breakdown, so
that it could not have been depended upon; for at that time and long
after, complexity and unreliability were synonymous.

Babbage, even with remarkably generous support for his time, could not
produce his great arithmetical machine. His idea was sound enough, but
construction and maintenance costs were then too heavy. Had a Pharaoh
been given detailed and explicit designs of an automobile, and had he
understood them completely, it would have taxed the resources of his
kingdom to have fashioned the thousands of parts for a single car, and
that car would have broken down on the first trip to Giza.

Machines with interchangeable parts can now be constructed with great
economy of effort. In spite of much complexity, they perform reliably.
Witness the humble typewriter, or the movie camera, or the automobile.
Electrical contacts have ceased to stick when thoroughly understood.
Note the automatic telephone exchange, which has hundreds of thousands
of such contacts, and yet is reliable. A spider web of metal, sealed in
a thin glass container, a wire heated to brilliant glow, in short, the
thermionic tube of radio sets, is made by the hundred million, tossed
about in packages, plugged into sockets—and it works! Its gossamer
parts, the precise location and alignment involved in its construction,
would have occupied a master craftsman of the guild for months; now it
is built for thirty cents. The world has arrived at an age of cheap
complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of
it.

A record if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously
extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted. Today
we make the record conventionally by writing and photography, followed
by printing; but we also record on film, on wax disks, and on magnetic
wires. Even if utterly new recording procedures do not appear, these
present ones are certainly in the process of modification and extension.

Certainly progress in photography is not going to stop. Faster material
and lenses, more automatic cameras, finer-grained sensitive compounds to
allow an extension of the minicamera idea, are all imminent. Let us
project this trend ahead to a logical, if not inevitable, outcome. The
camera hound of the future wears on his forehead a lump a little larger
than a walnut. It takes pictures 3 millimeters square, later to be
projected or enlarged, which after all involves only a factor of 10
beyond present practice. The lens is of universal focus, down to any
distance accommodated by the unaided eye, simply because it is of short
focal length. There is a built-in photocell on the walnut such as we now
have on at least one camera, which automatically adjusts exposure for a
wide range of illumination. There is film in the walnut for a hundred
exposures, and the spring for operating its shutter and shifting its
film is wound once for all when the film clip is inserted. It produces
its result in full color. It may well be stereoscopic, and record with
two spaced glass eyes, for striking improvements in stereoscopic
technique are just around the corner.

The cord which trips its shutter may reach down a man's sleeve within
easy reach of his fingers. A quick squeeze, and the picture is taken. On
a pair of ordinary glasses is a square of fine lines near the top of one
lens, where it is out of the way of ordinary vision. When an object
appears in that square, it is lined up for its picture. As the scientist
of the future moves about the laboratory or the field, every time he
looks at something worthy of the record, he trips the shutter and in it
goes, without even an audible click. Is this all fantastic? The only
fantastic thing about it is the idea of making as many pictures as would
result from its use.

Will there be dry photography? It is already here in two forms. When
Brady made his Civil War pictures, the plate had to be wet at the time
of exposure. Now it has to be wet during development instead. In the
future perhaps it need not be wetted at all. There have long been films
impregnated with diazo dyes which form a picture without development, so
that it is already there as soon as the camera has been operated. An
exposure to ammonia gas destroys the unexposed dye, and the picture can
then be taken out into the light and examined. The process is now slow,
but someone may speed it up, and it has no grain difficulties such as
now keep photographic researchers busy. Often it would be advantageous
to be able to snap the camera and to look at the picture immediately.

Another process now in use is also slow, and more or less clumsy. For
fifty years impregnated papers have been used which turn dark at every
point where an electrical contact touches them, by reason of the
chemical change thus produced in an iodine compound included in the
paper. They have been used to make records, for a pointer moving across
them can leave a trail behind. If the electrical potential on the
pointer is varied as it moves, the line becomes light or dark in
accordance with the potential.

This scheme is now used in facsimile transmission. The pointer draws a
set of closely spaced lines across the paper one after another. As it
moves, its potential is varied in accordance with a varying current
received over wires from a distant station, where these variations are
produced by a photocell which is similarly scanning a picture. At every
instant the darkness of the line being drawn is made equal to the
darkness of the point on the picture being observed by the photocell.
Thus, when the whole picture has been covered, a replica appears at the
receiving end.

A scene itself can be just as well looked over line by line by the
photocell in this way as can a photograph of the scene. This whole
apparatus constitutes a camera, with the added feature, which can be
dispensed with if desired, of making its picture at a distance. It is
slow, and the picture is poor in detail. Still, it does give another
process of dry photography, in which the picture is finished as soon as
it is taken.

It would be a brave man who would predict that such a process will
always remain clumsy, slow, and faulty in detail. Television equipment
today transmits sixteen reasonably good pictures a second, and it
involves only two essential differences from the process described
above. For one, the record is made by a moving beam of electrons rather
than a moving pointer, for the reason that an electron beam can sweep
across the picture very rapidly indeed. The other difference involves
merely the use of a screen which glows momentarily when the electrons
hit, rather than a chemically treated paper or film which is permanently
altered. This speed is necessary in television, for motion pictures
rather than stills are the object.

Use chemically treated film in place of the glowing screen, allow the
apparatus to transmit one picture only rather than a succession, and a
rapid camera for dry photography results. The treated film needs to be
far faster in action than present examples, but it probably could be.
More serious is the objection that this scheme would involve putting the
film inside a vacuum chamber, for electron beams behave normally only in
such a rarefied environment. This difficulty could be avoided by
allowing the electron beam to play on one side of a partition, and by
pressing the film against the other side, if this partition were such as
to allow the electrons to go through perpendicular to its surface, and
to prevent them from spreading out sideways. Such partitions, in crude
form, could certainly be constructed, and they will hardly hold up the
general development.

Like dry photography, microphotography still has a long way to go. The
basic scheme of reducing the size of the record, and examining it by
projection rather than directly, has possibilities too great to be
ignored. The combination of optical projection and photographic
reduction is already producing some results in microfilm for scholarly
purposes, and the potentialities are highly suggestive. Today, with
microfilm, reductions by a linear factor of 20 can be employed and still
produce full clarity when the material is re-enlarged for examination.
The limits are set by the graininess of the film, the excellence of the
optical system, and the efficiency of the light sources employed. All of
these are rapidly improving.

Assume a linear ratio of 100 for future use. Consider film of the same
thickness as paper, although thinner film will certainly be usable. Even
under these conditions there would be a total factor of 10,000 between
the bulk of the ordinary record on books, and its microfilm replica. The
*Encyclopoedia Britannica* could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox.
A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a
desk. If the human race has produced since the invention of movable type
a total record, in the form of magazines, newspapers, books, tracts,
advertising blurbs, correspondence, having a volume corresponding to a
billion books, the whole affair, assembled and compressed, could be
lugged off in a moving van. Mere compression, of course, is not enough;
one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to
consult it, and this aspect of the matter comes later. Even the modern
great library is not generally consulted; it is nibbled at by a few.

Compression is important, however, when it comes to costs. The material
for the microfilm *Britannica* would cost a nickel, and it could be
mailed anywhere for a cent. What would it cost to print a million
copies? To print a sheet of newspaper, in a large edition, costs a small
fraction of a cent. The entire material of the *Britannica* in reduced
microfilm form would go on a sheet eight and one-half by eleven inches.
Once it is available, with the photographic reproduction methods of the
future, duplicates in large quantities could probably be turned out for
a cent apiece beyond the cost of materials. The preparation of the
original copy? That introduces the next aspect of the subject.

To make the record, we now push a pencil or tap a typewriter. Then comes
the process of digestion and correction, followed by an intricate
process of typesetting, printing, and distribution. To consider the
first stage of the procedure, will the author of the future cease
writing by hand or typewriter and talk directly to the record? He does
so indirectly, by talking to a stenographer or a wax cylinder; but the
elements are all present if he wishes to have his talk directly produce
a typed record. All he needs to do is to take advantage of existing
mechanisms and to alter his language.

At a recent World Fair a machine called a Voder was shown. A girl
stroked its keys and it emitted recognizable speech. No human vocal
chords entered into the procedure at any point; the keys simply combined
some electrically produced vibrations and passed these on to a
loud-speaker. In the Bell Laboratories there is the converse of this
machine, called a Vocoder. The loudspeaker is replaced by a microphone,
which picks up sound. Speak to it, and the corresponding keys move. This
may be one element of the postulated system.

The other element is found in the stenotype, that somewhat disconcerting
device encountered usually at public meetings. A girl strokes its keys
languidly and looks about the room and sometimes at the speaker with a
disquieting gaze. From it emerges a typed strip which records in a
phonetically simplified language a record of what the speaker is
supposed to have said. Later this strip is retyped into ordinary
language, for in its nascent form it is intelligible only to the
initiated. Combine these two elements, let the Vocoder run the
stenotype, and the result is a machine which types when talked to.

Our present languages are not especially adapted to this sort of
mechanization, it is true. It is strange that the inventors of universal
languages have not seized upon the idea of producing one which better
fitted the technique for transmitting and recording speech.
Mechanization may yet force the issue, especially in the scientific
field; whereupon scientific jargon would become still less intelligible
to the layman.

One can now picture a future investigator in his laboratory. His hands
are free, and he is not anchored. As he moves about and observes, he
photographs and comments. Time is automatically recorded to tie the two
records together. If he goes into the field, he may be connected by
radio to his recorder. As he ponders over his notes in the evening, he
again talks his comments into the record. His typed record, as well as
his photographs, may both be in miniature, so that he projects them for
examination.

Much needs to occur, however, between the collection of data and
observations, the extraction of parallel material from the existing
record, and the final insertion of new material into the general body of
the common record. For mature thought there is no mechanical substitute.
But creative thought and essentially repetitive thought are very
different things. For the latter there are, and may be, powerful
mechanical aids.

Adding a column of figures is a repetitive thought process, and it was
long ago properly relegated to the machine. True, the machine is
sometimes controlled by a keyboard, and thought of a sort enters in
reading the figures and poking the corresponding keys, but even this is
avoidable. Machines have been made which will read typed figures by
photocells and then depress the corresponding keys; these are
combinations of photocells for scanning the type, electric circuits for
sorting the consequent variations, and relay circuits for interpreting
the result into the action of solenoids to pull the keys down.

All this complication is needed because of the clumsy way in which we
have learned to write figures. If we recorded them positionally, simply
by the configuration of a set of dots on a card, the automatic reading
mechanism would become comparatively simple. In fact if the dots are
holes, we have the punched-card machine long ago produced by Hollorith
for the purposes of the census, and now used throughout business. Some
types of complex businesses could hardly operate without these machines.

Adding is only one operation. To perform arithmetical computation
involves also subtraction, multiplication, and division, and in addition
some method for temporary storage of results, removal from storage for
further manipulation, and recording of final results by printing.
Machines for these purposes are now of two types: keyboard machines for
accounting and the like, manually controlled for the insertion of data,
and usually automatically controlled as far as the sequence of
operations is concerned; and punched-card machines in which separate
operations are usually delegated to a series of machines, and the cards
then transferred bodily from one to another. Both forms are very useful;
but as far as complex computations are concerned, both are still in
embryo.

Rapid electrical counting appeared soon after the physicists found it
desirable to count cosmic rays. For their own purposes the physicists
promptly constructed thermionic-tube equipment capable of counting
electrical impulses at the rate of 100,000 a second. The advanced
arithmetical machines of the future will be electrical in nature, and
they will perform at 100 times present speeds, or more.

Moreover, they will be far more versatile than present commercial
machines, so that they may readily be adapted for a wide variety of
operations. They will be controlled by a control card or film, they will
select their own data and manipulate it in accordance with the
instructions thus inserted, they will perform complex arithmetical
computations at exceedingly high speeds, and they will record results in
such form as to be readily available for distribution or for later
further manipulation. Such machines will have enormous appetites. One of
them will take instructions and data from a whole roomful of girls armed
with simple key board punches, and will deliver sheets of computed
results every few minutes. There will always be plenty of things to
compute in the detailed affairs of millions of people doing complicated
things.

4

The repetitive processes of thought are not confined however, to matters
of arithmetic and statistics. In fact, every time one combines and
records facts in accordance with established logical processes, the
creative aspect of thinking is concerned only with the selection of the
data and the process to be employed and the manipulation thereafter is
repetitive in nature and hence a fit matter to be relegated to the
machine. Not so much has been done along these lines,beyond the bounds
of arithmetic, as might be done, primarily because of the economics of
the situation. The needs of business and the extensive market obviously
waiting, assured the advent of mass-produced arithmetical machines just
as soon as production methods were sufficiently advanced.

With machines for advanced analysis no such situation existed; for there
was and is no extensive market; the users of advanced methods of
manipulating data are a very small part of the population. There are,
however, machines for solving differential equations—and functional and
integral equations, for that matter. There are many special machines,
such as the harmonic synthesizer which predicts the tides. There will be
many more, appearing certainly first in the hands of the scientist and
in small numbers.

If scientific reasoning were limited to the logical processes of
arithmetic, we should not get far in our understanding of the physical
world. One might as well attempt to grasp the game of poker entirely by
the use of the mathematics of probability. The abacus, with its beads
strung on parallel wires, led the Arabs to positional numeration and the
concept of zero many centuries before the rest of the world; and it was
a useful tool—so useful that it still exists.

It is a far cry from the abacus to the modern keyboard accounting
machine. It will be an equal step to the arithmetical machine of the
future. But even this new machine will not take the scientist where he
needs to go. Relief must be secured from laborious detailed manipulation
of higher mathematics as well, if the users of it are to free their
brains for something more than repetitive detailed transformations in
accordance with established rules. A mathematician is not a man who can
readily manipulate figures; often he cannot. He is not even a man who
can readily perform the transformations of equations by the use of
calculus. He is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of
symbolic logic on a high plane, and especially he is a man of intuitive
judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes he employs.

All else he should be able to turn over to his mechanism, just as
confidently as he turns over the propelling of his car to the intricate
mechanism under the hood. Only then will mathematics be practically
effective in bringing the growing knowledge of atomistics to the useful
solution of the advanced problems of chemistry, metallurgy, and biology.
For this reason there still come more machines to handle advanced
mathematics for the scientist. Some of them will be sufficiently bizarre
to suit the most fastidious connoisseur of the present artifacts of
civilization.

5

The scientist, however, is not the only person who manipulates data and
examines the world about him by the use of logical processes, although
he sometimes preserves this appearance by adopting into the fold anyone
who becomes logical, much in the manner in which a British labor leader
is elevated to knighthood. Whenever logical processes of thought are
employed—that is, whenever thought for a time runs along an accepted
groove—there is an opportunity for the machine. Formal logic used to be
a keen instrument in the hands of the teacher in his trying of students'
souls. It is readily possible to construct a machine which will
manipulate premises in accordance with formal logic, simply by the
clever use of relay circuits. Put a set of premises into such a device
and turn the crank, and it will readily pass out conclusion after
conclusion, all in accordance with logical law, and with no more slips
than would be expected of a keyboard adding machine.

Logic can become enormously difficult, and it would undoubtedly be well
to produce more assurance in its use. The machines for higher analysis
have usually been equation solvers. Ideas are beginning to appear for
equation transformers, which will rearrange the relationship expressed
by an equation in accordance with strict and rather advanced logic.
Progress is inhibited by the exceedingly crude way in which
mathematicians express their relationships. They employ a symbolism
which grew like Topsy and has little consistency; a strange fact in that
most logical field.

A new symbolism, probably positional, must apparently precede the
reduction of mathematical transformations to machine processes. Then, on
beyond the strict logic of the mathematician, lies the application of
logic in everyday affairs. We may some day click off arguments on a
machine with the same assurance that we now enter sales on a cash
register. But the machine of logic will not look like a cash register,
even of the streamlined model.

So much for the manipulation of ideas and their insertion into the
record. Thus far we seem to be worse off than before—for we can
enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly
consult it. This is a much larger matter than merely the extraction of
data for the purposes of scientific research; it involves the entire
process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge.
The prime action of use is selection, and here we are halting indeed.
There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the
experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of
acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a
week by diligent search, his syntheses are not likely to keep up with
the current scene.

Selection, in this broad sense, is a stone adze in the hands of a
cabinetmaker. Yet, in a narrow sense and in other areas, something has
already been done mechanically on selection. The personnel officer of a
factory drops a stack of a few thousand employee cards into a selecting
machine, sets a code in accordance with an established convention, and
produces in a short time a list of all employees who live in Trenton and
know Spanish. Even such devices are much too slow when it comes, for
example, to matching a set of fingerprints with one of five million on
file. Selection devices of this sort will soon be speeded up from their
present rate of reviewing data at a few hundred a minute. By the use of
photocells and microfilm they will survey items at the rate of a
thousand a second, and will print out duplicates of those selected.

This process, however, is simple selection: it proceeds by examining in
turn every one of a large set of items, and by picking out those which
have certain specified characteristics. There is another form of
selection best illustrated by the automatic telephone exchange. You dial
a number and the machine selects and connects just one of a million
possible stations. It does not run over them all. It pays attention only
to a class given by a first digit, then only to a subclass of this given
by the second digit, and so on; and thus proceeds rapidly and almost
unerringly to the selected station. It requires a few seconds to make
the selection, although the process could be speeded up if increased
speed were economically warranted. If necessary, it could be made
extremely fast by substituting thermionic-tube switching for mechanical
switching, so that the full selection could be made in one one-hundredth
of a second. No one would wish to spend the money necessary to make this
change in the telephone system, but the general idea is applicable
elsewhere.

Take the prosaic problem of the great department store. Every time a
charge sale is made, there are a number of things to be done. The
inventory needs to be revised, the salesman needs to be given credit for
the sale, the general accounts need an entry, and, most important, the
customer needs to be charged. A central records device has been
developed in which much of this work is done conveniently. The salesman
places on a stand the customer's identification card, his own card, and
the card taken from the article sold—all punched cards. When he pulls a
lever, contacts are made through the holes, machinery at a central point
makes the necessary computations and entries, and the proper receipt is
printed for the salesman to pass to the customer.

But there may be ten thousand charge customers doing business with the
store, and before the full operation can be completed someone has to
select the right card and insert it at the central office. Now rapid
selection can slide just the proper card into position in an instant or
two, and return it afterward. Another difficulty occurs, however.
Someone must read a total on the card, so that the machine can add its
computed item to it. Conceivably the cards might be of the dry
photography type I have described. Existing totals could then be read by
photocell, and the new total entered by an electron beam.

The cards may be in miniature, so that they occupy little space. They
must move quickly. They need not be transferred far, but merely into
position so that the photocell and recorder can operate on them.
Positional dots can enter the data. At the end of the month a machine
can readily be made to read these and to print an ordinary bill. With
tube selection, in which no mechanical parts are involved in the
switches, little time need be occupied in bringing the correct card into
use—a second should suffice for the entire operation. The whole record
on the card may be made by magnetic dots on a steel sheet if desired,
instead of dots to be observed optically, following the scheme by which
Poulsen long ago put speech on a magnetic wire. This method has the
advantage of simplicity and ease of erasure. By using photography,
however one can arrange to project the record in enlarged form and at a
distance by using the process common in television equipment.

One can consider rapid selection of this form, and distant projection
for other purposes. To be able to key one sheet of a million before an
operator in a second or two, with the possibility of then adding notes
thereto, is suggestive in many ways. It might even be of use in
libraries, but that is another story. At any rate, there are now some
interesting combinations possible. One might, for example, speak to a
microphone, in the manner described in connection with the speech
controlled typewriter, and thus make his selections. It would certainly
beat the usual file clerk.

6

The real heart of the matter of selection, however, goes deeper than a
lag in the adoption of mechanisms by libraries, or a lack of development
of devices for their use. Our ineptitude in getting at the record is
largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. When data of
any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or
numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down
from subclass to subclass. It can be in only one place, unless
duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to which path will locate
it, and the rules are cumbersome. Having found one item, moreover, one
has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a new path.

The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With
one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested
by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of
trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics,
of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade,
items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of
action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is
awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature.

Man cannot hope fully to duplicate this mental process artificially, but
he certainly ought to be able to learn from it. In minor ways he may
even improve, for his records have relative permanency. The first idea,
however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection. Selection by
association, rather than indexing, may yet be mechanized. One cannot
hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility with which the mind follows
an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind
decisively in regard to the permanence and clarity of the items
resurrected from storage.

Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of
mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one
at random, "memex" will do. A memex is a device in which an individual
stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is
mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and
flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.

It consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be operated from a
distance, it is primarily the piece of furniture at which he works. On
the top are slanting translucent screens, on which material can be
projected for convenient reading. There is a keyboard, and sets of
buttons and levers. Otherwise it looks like an ordinary desk.

In one end is the stored material. The matter of bulk is well taken care
of by improved microfilm. Only a small part of the interior of the memex
is devoted to storage, the rest to mechanism. Yet if the user inserted
5000 pages of material a day it would take him hundreds of years to fill
the repository, so he can be profligate and enter material freely.

Most of the memex contents are purchased on microfilm ready for
insertion. Books of all sorts, pictures, current periodicals,
newspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into place. Business
correspondence takes the same path. And there is provision for direct
entry. On the top of the memex is a transparent platen. On this are
placed longhand notes, photographs, memoranda, all sorts of things. When
one is in place, the depression of a lever causes it to be photographed
onto the next blank space in a section of the memex film, dry
photography being employed.

There is, of course, provision for consultation of the record by the
usual scheme of indexing. If the user wishes to consult a certain book,
he taps its code on the keyboard, and the title page of the book
promptly appears before him, projected onto one of his viewing
positions. Frequently-used codes are mnemonic, so that he seldom
consults his code book; but when he does, a single tap of a key projects
it for his use. Moreover, he has supplemental levers. On deflecting one
of these levers to the right he runs through the book before him, each
page in turn being projected at a speed which just allows a recognizing
glance at each. If he deflects it further to the right, he steps through
the book 10 pages at a time; still further at 100 pages at a time.
Deflection to the left gives him the same control backwards.

A special button transfers him immediately to the first page of the
index. Any given book of his library can thus be called up and consulted
with far greater facility than if it were taken from a shelf. As he has
several projection positions, he can leave one item in position while he
calls up another. He can add marginal notes and comments, taking
advantage of one possible type of dry photography, and it could even be
arranged so that he can do this by a stylus scheme, such as is now
employed in the telautograph seen in railroad waiting rooms, just as
though he had the physical page before him.

7

All this is conventional, except for the projection forward of
present-day mechanisms and gadgetry. It affords an immediate step,
however, to associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a provision
whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and
automatically another. This is the essential feature of the memex. The
process of tying two items together is the important thing.

When the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts the name in his
code book, and taps it out on his keyboard. Before him are the two items
to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions. At the bottom
of each there are a number of blank code spaces, and a pointer is set to
indicate one of these on each item. The user taps a single key, and the
items are permanently joined. In each code space appears the code word.
Out of view, but also in the code space, is inserted a set of dots for
photocell viewing; and on each item these dots by their positions
designate the index number of the other item.

Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other
can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the
corresponding code space. Moreover, when numerous items have been thus
joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn, rapidly
or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning the pages of
a book. It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered
together from widely separated sources and bound together to form a new
book. It is more than this, for any item can be joined into numerous
trails.

The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and
properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the
short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the
skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books
and articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds
an interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a
history, he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together.
Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a
comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it
by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the
elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with
the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through
textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a
page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his
interest through the maze of materials available to him.

And his trails do not fade. Several years later, his talk with a friend
turns to the queer ways in which a people resist innovations, even of
vital interest. He has an example, in the fact that the outraged
Europeans still failed to adopt the Turkish bow. In fact he has a trail
on it. A touch brings up the code book. Tapping a few keys projects the
head of the trail. A lever runs through it at will, stopping at
interesting items, going off on side excursions. It is an interesting
trail, pertinent to the discussion. So he sets a reproducer in action,
photographs the whole trail out, and passes it to his friend for
insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general
trail.

8

Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of
associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the
memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated
opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of
friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of
issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client's
interest. The physician, puzzled by a patient's reactions, strikes the
trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly
through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics
for the pertinent anatomy and histology. The chemist, struggling with
the synthesis of an organic compound, has all the chemical literature
before him in his laboratory, with trails following the analogies of
compounds, and side trails to their physical and chemical behavior.

The historian, with a vast chronological account of a people, parallels
it with a skip trail which stops only on the salient items, and can
follow at any time contemporary trails which lead him all over
civilization at a particular epoch. There is a new profession of trail
blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful
trails through the enormous mass of the common record. The inheritance
from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record,
but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.

Thus science may implement the ways in which man produces, stores, and
consults the record of the race. It might be striking to outline the
instrumentalities of the future more spectacularly, rather than to stick
closely to methods and elements now known and undergoing rapid
development, as has been done here. Technical difficulties of all sorts
have been ignored, certainly, but also ignored are means as yet unknown
which may come any day to accelerate technical progress as violently as
did the advent of the thermionic tube. In order that the picture may not
be too commonplace, by reason of sticking to present-day patterns, it
may be well to mention one such possibility, not to prophesy but merely
to suggest, for prophecy based on extension of the known has substance,
while prophecy founded on the unknown is only a doubly involved guess.

All our steps in creating or absorbing material of the record proceed
through one of the senses—the tactile when we touch keys, the oral when
we speak or listen, the visual when we read. Is it not possible that
some day the path may be established more directly?

We know that when the eye sees, all the consequent information is
transmitted to the brain by means of electrical vibrations in the
channel of the optic nerve. This is an exact analogy with the electrical
vibrations which occur in the cable of a television set: they convey the
picture from the photocells which see it to the radio transmitter from
which it is broadcast. We know further that if we can approach that
cable with the proper instruments, we do not need to touch it; we can
pick up those vibrations by electrical induction and thus discover and
reproduce the scene which is being transmitted, just as a telephone wire
may be tapped for its message.

The impulses which flow in the arm nerves of a typist convey to her
fingers the translated information which reaches her eye or ear, in
order that the fingers may be caused to strike the proper keys. Might
not these currents be intercepted, either in the original form in which
information is conveyed to the brain, or in the marvelously
metamorphosed form in which they then proceed to the hand?

By bone conduction we already introduce sounds: into the nerve channels
of the deaf in order that they may hear. Is it not possible that we may
learn to introduce them without the present cumbersomeness of first
transforming electrical vibrations to mechanical ones, which the human
mechanism promptly transforms back to the electrical form? With a couple
of electrodes on the skull the encephalograph now produces pen-and-ink
traces which bear some relation to the electrical phenomena going on in
the brain itself. True, the record is unintelligible, except as it
points out certain gross misfunctioning of the cerebral mechanism; but
who would now place bounds on where such a thing may lead?

In the outside world, all forms of intelligence whether of sound or
sight, have been reduced to the form of varying currents in an electric
circuit in order that they may be transmitted. Inside the human frame
exactly the same sort of process occurs. Must we always transform to
mechanical movements in order to proceed from one electrical phenomenon
to another? It is a suggestive thought, but it hardly warrants
prediction without losing touch with reality and immediateness.

Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his
shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present
problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to
mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its
logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by
overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if
he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does
not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can
find them again if they prove important.

The applications of science have built man a well-supplied house, and
are teaching him to live healthily therein. They have enabled him to
throw masses of people against one another with cruel weapons. They may
yet allow him truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the
wisdom of race experience. He may perish in conflict before he learns to
wield that record for his true good. Yet, in the application of science
to the needs and desires of man, it would seem to be a singularly
unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as
to the outcome.
