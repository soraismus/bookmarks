Peer-to-peer lending
--------------------

### Banking without banks

By offering both borrowers and lenders a better deal, websites that put the two together are challenging retail banks

SAVERS have never had a worse deal but for most borrowers, credit is
scarce and costly. That seeming paradox attracts new businesses free of
the bad balance sheets, high costs and dreadful reputations which burden
most conventional banks.

Foremost among the newcomers are peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms,
which match borrowers and lenders directly, usually via online auctions.
The loans issued often comprise many tiny slivers from different
lenders. Some P2P platforms slice, dice and package the loans; others
allow lenders to pick them. Either way, the result is a strikingly
better deal for both sides. Zopa, a British P2P platform, offers 4.9% to
lenders (most bank accounts pay nothing) and typically charges 5.6% on a
personal loan (which is competitive with the rates most banks charge).

Elsewhere, returns (and risks) are higher. IsePankur, which lends to
more than 60,000 people in four euro-zone countries, pays its lenders
(who include your correspondent) a stonking 21.45% average net return
(after a 3% default rate). Its typical borrowers do not flinch at rates
of up to 28%: they are refinancing far costlier credit-card debt and
doorstep loans.

Peer-to-peer lending is growing fast in many countries. In Britain, loan
volumes are doubling every six months. They have just passed the £1
billion mark ($1.7 billion), though this is tiny against the country’s
£1.2 trillion in retail deposits. In America, the two largest P2P
lenders, Lending Club and Prosper, have 98% of the market. They issued
$2.4 billion in loans in 2013, up from $871m in 2012. The minnows are
doing even better, though they are growing from a much lower base.

Neil Bindoff of PwC, a professional-services firm, speaks of a “perfect
storm” supporting P2P’s growth. Interest rates are close to zero, the
public is fed up with banks, costs are low (one third of a typical
bank’s, according to Renaud Laplanche of Lending Club), and e-commerce
is becoming part of daily life. People use the internet for peer-to-peer
telephony (Skype) and shopping (eBay), so why not loans?

Awareness is still low—a survey by pwc found only 15% of Britons claimed
to have heard of the big P2P firms such as Zopa, Funding Circle and
RateSetter; 98% had heard of the main banks. Another hurdle in Britain
is that P2P is not fully regulated; that will change on April 1st. The
Financial Conduct Authority will issue the new rules imminently. In
America, people saving for retirement can apply tax breaks to their
loans, and offset their losses against profits. Britain’s P2P industry
is awaiting a decision to extend tax-free savings schemes to its
lenders.

Regulation to the rescue

Regulation should help forestall a big worry: that an ill-run platform
might collapse, taking investors’ money with it. At a conference
organised by the P2P Finance Association, a trade body, this week,
executives were worried about the risks of a “Bitcoin-style bust” that
could rattle confidence in the nascent industry. New rules are likely to
insist that P2P businesses ringfence unlent funds gathered from savers
and arrange for third parties to manage outstanding loans if they cease
trading.

Other big questions abound. One is insurance. Funds placed with P2P
lenders are not covered by the state-backed guarantees that protect
retail deposits in banks. Some platforms offer something of a
substitute. Zopa and most other British companies have started
“provision funds”, which aim (but do not promise) to make good on loans
that sour. These smooth the risk for lenders, but blunt the original P2P
concept. So too does insurance: Ron Suber of Prosper, America’s
second-biggest lender, says “deep actuarial conversations” are going on
with outsiders who would like to help lenders provide for the risk that
their borrower defaults, dies, or loses his job. Purists fear such
arrangements could recreate the moral hazard that has plagued
conventional banking.

The boom in cross-border P2P raises tricky legal questions. The European
Commission has yet to get to grips with the industry. National rules
often determine how credit is issued and debts are collected. But they
offer little help when the money comes from hundreds of lenders in
dozens of countries. Yield-chasing foreigners, private and
institutional, are investing heavily in the American market.

Only a third of the money coming to Lending Club is now from retail
investors: the rest (the fastest-growing slice) comes from rich people
and institutions. Should such big investors get a better deal—such as
getting their pick of the best loans on offer? In Britain, Giles Andrews
of Zopa regards the idea as anathema: all savers should be treated
equally. Some others think big lenders will eventually dominate P2P.

P2P also ends the dangerous mismatch between short-term deposits and
long-term loans inherent in conventional banking—but generally by
locking lenders in for the loan’s duration. A secondary market in P2P
loans is developing fast. This allows investors to get their money back
if they need it, usually by selling the loans at a discount. But rules
vary: some platforms will buy back the loans; others just hold an
auction.

P2P is not complicated: success largely depends on marketing oomph, the
quality of the algorithms used to screen borrowers and ease of use (P2P
platforms are scrambling to develop apps for smartphones and tablets).
P2P may attract big outsiders, such as banks, or internet companies
which already have lots of data about their customers and (like
Facebook) are good at connecting them. Google last year led a $125m
investment in Lending Club, valuing it at $1.55 billion. It might well
want more.
