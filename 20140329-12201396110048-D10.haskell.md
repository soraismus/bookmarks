### Introductions to advanced Haskell topics

Many people bemoan the sharp divide between experts and beginning
Haskell programmers. One thing I've noticed is that "advanced" Haskell
topics all have one thing in common: there exists only one good tutorial
on that topic and only the experts have found it. This post is a
collection of links to what I consider to be the definitive tutorials on
these topics.

#### Monads

Monads are technically not an advanced Haskell topic, but I include this
topic in the list because the vast majority of monad tutorials are
terrible and/or misleading. In my opinion, the [best monad tutorial
(Titled: "You could have invented
monads")](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html)
was written 8 years ago by Dan Piponi and nobody has ever improved on it
since.

#### Monad Transformers

One thing that perpetually boggles me is that the blogosphere has almost
no posts explaining how to use monad transformers. In fact, the only
good explanation I know of is a [very simple paper by Martin Grabmuller
(Titled: "Monad Transformers - Step by
Step")](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~wh5a/personal/Transformers.pdf).
Most beginners will skip over an academic paper like this when searching
for tutorials since most people don't associate the word "academic" with
beginner-friendly. However, don't let that fool you: this paper is very
well written and easy to read.

#### Parsing

Outsiders comment that monads only exist to paper over Haskell's
weaknesses until they discover monadic parsers. The truly mind-blowing
moment is when you learn how simple they are to implement when you read
Hutton and Meijer's [functional pearl on monadic parsing (Titled:
"Monadic Parsing in
Haskell")](http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~jlc/courses/3015/parser_pearl.pdf).
They walk through how to implement a backtracking parser, how to
implement the `Monad` type class for this parser, and how to define
several parsing primitives and chain them together into more
sophisticated functionality. After you read this functional pearl you
will never doubt the significance of monads ever again.

You also want to understand parser combinators for another reason:
Haskell parser combinator libraries are light-years ahead of Haskell
regular expression libraries. This confuses many people who come to
Haskell from a language that uses regular expressions heavily (such as
Python or Perl) and they wonder why regular expression support is so bad
in Haskell. The reason is that nearly all Haskell programmers use parser
combinator libraries such as
[parsec](hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec) or
[attoparsec](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec).

#### Free Monads

This is the only case where I will plug a post of my own. I wrote a
[tutorial on free monads (Titled: "Why free monads
matter")](http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html)
because back when I was trying to understand free monads I could not
find any beginner-friendly explanation. Everything on this subject was
written for a target audience of mathematicians and would motivate their
use cases using mathematical examples.

I wanted to explain the motivation behind free monads in terms that a
programmer would understand and my post explains the topic in terms of
creating a syntax tree and interpreting that syntax tree. Understanding
free monads will greatly improve your understanding for how to build
monadic domain-specific languages within Haskell. Also, many people
comment that understanding free monads greatly improves their mental
model for Haskell `IO` as well.

#### Coroutines

Haskell coroutine libraries (like `pipes`/`conduit`/`machines`) have
what appear to be impenetrable implementations ... until you read Mario
Blazevic's [article on coroutines in issue 19 of The Monad Reader
(Titled: Coroutine
Pipelines")](http://themonadreader.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/issue19.pdf).

In that article he introduces the `Coroutine` type (which is now more
commonly known as the free monad transformer) which unifies every
coroutine implementation into a single pattern. Once you understand his
article, you will understand the internals of coroutine libraries and
you will be able to easily write a streaming library of your own.

#### Lenses

Lens tutorials are the new monad tutorials, and the one mistake that all
lens tutorials make is that none of them clearly explain **how lenses
work**. The only post that ever got this right was the original post by
Twan van Laarhoven that first introduced the [modern formulation of
lenses (Titled: "CPS Functional
references")](http://twanvl.nl/blog/haskell/cps-functional-references).
The problem is that post is incredibly hard to find even through a
dedicated Google search for lens tutorials because the title is obscure
and the post only has a single mention of the word "lens". I actually
had trouble finding this post even by browsing his blog archive because
I didn't recognize the title.

Honorable mention: The [`lens-family-core`
library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core) is the
only lens library that actually hews closely to Twan's original
presentation, so I highly recommend that you study its source code to
further improve your understanding.

#### Church encoding

I still can't find a good blog post on Church encoding, so I will not
link to anything. However, once you learn how to Church encode a data
type you will suddenly see this pattern **everywhere**.

Equally important, many high-performance Haskell libraries (like
`attoparsec`) use Church encoding for efficiency reasons and
understanding Church encoding will allow you to understand their
internal implementations.

#### Conclusion

I'm really disappointed that so many critical Haskell topics only have a
single source of truth that is difficult to find. I hypothesize that the
problem is that Haskell is rooted in computer science academia, which
discourages duplicate publications on the same topic. If you want to
prove me wrong, then please take the time to increase the number of high
quality Haskell tutorials on these and other key topics.

Another troubling trend is that tendency for people to bandwagon on
particular tutorial topics that are sexy (first monads, now lenses). I
wish people would spend more time diversifying coverage on more mundane
topics, like how to apply well-established libraries to architect
various types of applications.

    "I'm really disappointed that so many critical Haskell topics only

    \
    Agreed; I have long thought that Haskell's biggest weakness
    generally is that there aren't very many good books about it. Most
    documentation is scattered through random papers and blog posts.
    Even library Haddocks often have references to papers--some of which
    are hard to find.\
    \
    "Lens tutorials are the new monad tutorials"\
    \
    Laughed when I read this because I've been thinking it for awhile.
    This is part of why I have been avoiding lenses. They seem like a
    huge grab bag of concepts tossed into one nasty stew.\
    \
    "they wonder why regular expression support is so bad in Haskell."\
    \
    Actually I'd say that Haskell regex support is just as good as
    Python's. Just like Python, Haskell requires you to load up a
    library to get regexps. There is a confusing smattering of libraries
    (the heavily overloaded interface of regex-base does beginners no
    favors) but pcre-light is easy to grasp and benefits from the
    exhaustive documentation of the pcre library.\
    \
    But Haskell's parser combinator libraries do shine, so I typically
    avoid regexps for anything static (sometimes regexps are handy if
    you want to allow the user to specify search strings at runtime.)

        Yeah, I should change my regex statement because you're right
        that \`pcre-light\` is decent and has okay tutorials. I will try
        to rephrase that section.

    These posts has some introduction to Church encodings that's pretty

    Very nice write-up. Do you have any recommended materials for FRP?
    It often feels similarly fragmented and I'd love to hear your
    recommendations on the topic.

        Elm is probably the best starting point. The FRP field is
        fragmented, but I think Evan Czaplicki (the author of Elm) has
        put far more thought into the issue of how to provide a simple
        interface while sacrificing as little power as possible.

    The best article I've found that really explains church encodings is
    this one:
    http://matt.might.net/articles/compiling-up-to-lambda-calculus/\
    It's done in a subset of Scheme, though, not Haskell.
