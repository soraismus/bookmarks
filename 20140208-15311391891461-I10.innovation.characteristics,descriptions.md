 20 Qualities of an Innovator

![11edison.1.600.jpg](http://www.ideachampions.com/weblogs/11edison.1.600.jpg)

The word "innovate" can be traced all the way back to 1440. It comes
from the Middle French word "innovacyon," meaning "renewal" or "new way
of doing things".

Exactly what innovations actually happened in 1440 (rounder oxcart
wheels?) is anybody's guess, but whatever they were, it's likely they
improved the quality of life for more than a few people.

These days, the "innovation thing" is something of a no-brainer. Every
company worth its low-salt lunch has identified innovation as a core
competency needing to be developed.

Who in their right mind (or is it right brain?) can deny the value of
improving things? Isn't this what human beings, those grand inventors of
the microchip and the chocolate chip, are supposed to do?

True. But who has time?

And so begins the search for the magic pill -- the system, formula, or
blueprint that will make innovation a done deal.

Innovation, unfortunately -- unlike audits, re-engineering, or your high
school penmanship teacher -- is not given to systems, formulas, and
blueprints. It is given to *people* -- restless, inspired, fascinated
people with an almost cellular need to change things for the better.

![martha\_graham\_Kick.jpg](http://www.ideachampions.com/weblogs/martha_graham_Kick.jpg)

And while it can certainly be *supported* by systems, it can never be
*reduced* to systems.

If you want to ignite innovation in your organization, forget about
slick formulas for a minute and pay attention to what's happening on the
*inside*. Because that's where innovation starts. With the *innovator*
-- the inspired individual, compelled to make a difference.

And the key to the innovator? The special blend of qualities that allows
him or her to succeed while their co-workers are bitching and moaning on
their way to their next unnecessary meeting?

Is it tools? Techniques? Metrics?

Sure, they're useful. But without the *user* of them having the right
stuff, they're merely decoration -- like having a shiny set of new
jumper cables, but no car.

And so... if you are one of the self-chosen few who are willing to stop
blaming your organization, the economy, your boss, your industry, the
government, HR, your mother, your astrological sign, the Board, and the
bored, now's the time to start taking *personal responsibility for
innovating.*

Now's your chance to kick things in high gear.

![Bruce-Lee-kicking-edit.jpg](http://www.ideachampions.com/weblogs/Bruce-Lee-kicking-edit.jpg)

Now's the time to get the lead out -- to lead the revolution wherever
you happen to be working at the time and make some magic.

Yes, it begins with you. But *where* does it begin with you?

*With awareness.*

In the words of the great psychologist, Fritz Perls, "awareness cures."
Yes, it does.

Still with me?

If so, take a few minutes now to try the following exercise to get the
party started.

All you need to do is rate yourself, on a scale of 1-10, for how much
you manifest the following qualities in the workplace. Note which ones
are your strengths -- and how can you build on them. Then note which
ones are your weaknesses -- and how can you strengthen them.

You might even give them to your team and ask them to rate themselves.
Then get together and talk about what you've all come up with.

And don't forget to floss.\
