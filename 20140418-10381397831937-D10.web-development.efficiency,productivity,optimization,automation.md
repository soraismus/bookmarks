Performance
===========

A 2010 study by Jakob Nielsen found that “[s]lowness (or speed) makes
such an impact that it can become one of the brand values customers
associate with a site”^[1](#fn1)^. If a user is forced to wait more than
a few seconds for a page, they no longer feel in control of the
experience and are likely to investigate alternatives.

On a more positive note, Nielsen also reveals that a speed increase of
as little as 0.1 seconds can produce a noticeable lift in conversion
rates. This is confirmed by a Google study from 2009^[2](#fn2)^, in
which a 0.2 second delay decreased the number of searches by up to
0.36%, a significant number of customers for mass-market web apps.

Some say that performance is a feature and that it should be given the
same priority as feature development, but even that may be
underestimating its importance. Adequate performance is an absolute
necessity that directly affects customer adoption of your app.

\

What can we do to improve it?

Minimise payload size
---------------------

There are a number of ways we can send fewer and smaller files from the
server to the browser.

First, **optimise all the image files**. Images often make up the bulk
of the page payload and offer a good opportunity for performance
improvements. Choose the best image format: JPEG for photographic images
with a high number of colours and PNG for everything else. The GIF
format may produce a slightly smaller file size for very small one- or
two-colour images, but the fact that browsers render PNG images
faster^[3](#fn3)^ than GIF may negate this small difference. When in
doubt, choose PNG over GIF.

**Optimise image compression as well.** For JPEG files this means
trading off quality against file size. As a rule of thumb, about 85%
quality (15% compression) gives a good balance between file size and
quality. For PNG files, reduce the colour depth to accommodate the
maximum number of colours: 24-bit for 16 million colours; 16-bit for
65,000 colours; 12-bit for 4,000 colours; or 8-bit for 256 colours. The
8-bit PNG is a special case and becomes a palette image, which means
that every unique colour in the image increases the file size slightly.
Remove duplicate colours and merge similar colours to further optimise
palette images.

Many image editors insert metadata into image files, details which won’t
be useful in your app. Use an image compressor to **remove the
metadata** and perform other useful optimisations. Try
OptiPNG^[4](#fn4)^ for PNGs and jpegtran^[5](#fn5)^ for JPEGs. A Google
search for *online PNG optimiser* will highlight a number of online apps
that remove metadata and perform other safe PNG compression techniques.

Next, **strip out dead code**. It’s inevitable that some HTML, CSS and
JavaScript will become outdated during the development of a complex web
app. If you can identify extraneous `<div>`s, JavaScript functions and
CSS selectors, you can remove them from the page payload. This is
usually a manual exercise for those with expert knowledge of the
codebase: dynamic `eval()`s in JavaScript and configurable callbacks
from Ajax make it almost impossible for an automated checker to be
completely accurate about unnecessary code. You could still use tools
like JSLint^[6](#fn6)^ and Dust-Me Selectors^[7](#fn7)^ to point you in
the right direction.

Be sure to **minify text files**. JavaScript and CSS files often contain
comments, formatting white space and lengthy descriptive variable names
that are of no use to the browser or user. Run the production versions
of these files through a code minifier to create smaller files (YUI
Compressor^[8](#fn8)^ is a widely used tool). HTML can also be compacted
with tools like HtmlCompressor^[9](#fn9)^, though usually to a lesser
extent.

Text files can also be gzipped. **Enable gzip compression** on your web
server for HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. To get the best compression
out of the gzip algorithm, Google recommends^[10](#fn10)^ that you code
consistently: use lowercase whenever possible; use the same quote
character for HTML attributes (single or double); and specify HTML
attributes in the same order (always put the `src` attribute first in
image markup, for example).

Larger files can be **loaded on demand**. If your app uses a large piece
of JavaScript or CSS that is only applicable to a specific subsection or
page, separate it out and load it only when those sections are used.
Also consider *lazy loading* large images that are towards the bottom of
longer pages and not initially visible. Lazy load plug-ins are available
for most JavaScript frameworks, like the Yahoo! YUI
ImageLoader^[11](#fn11)^.

Implementing **client-side form validation** will lead to a few
kilobytes extra JavaScript, but it will save users from the larger round
trip to the server to download an error page.

Finally, use **UTF-8 characters** rather than entities. A UTF-8-encoded
character will always occupy fewer bytes than an HTML entity equivalent.
For example, the copyright symbol © is encoded in two bytes as a UTF-8
character, whereas the entities `&copy;` and `&#169;` are six bytes
apiece, one per character.

Optimise caching
----------------

There’s no need to download app files twice: allow the browser to
appropriately re-use files that have already been downloaded.

**Place CSS and JavaScript in external files.** Inline styles and
scripts aren’t cached between pages whereas external files are.

**Set your cache HTTP header fields.** Configure your web server to send
future `Expires` or `Cache-Control: max-age` HTTP header fields for
images, JavaScript, CSS and other static files. Cache dates can be up to
one year in the future. Get into the habit of including version numbers
in JavaScript and CSS filenames, so that new releases break the
long-term cache in browsers and force a new download.

![img-19\_1](img-19_1.jpg)

Twitter sends Cache-Control and Expires header fields to cache its logo
image for almost one year.

**Make Ajax cacheable.** Partial Ajax responses can also send a future
`Expires` header field if the Ajax URL includes a relevant fingerprint,
usually a timestamp. For example, if the Ajax code requests the latest
five messages for a user, the URL should include the latest message
timestamp: *http://app.com/msg?t=1299318393*. If the messages haven’t
changed since the previous request, the timestamp and URL will be the
same, and the browser will use the local cache.

Consider a **shared content delivery network** (CDN). Unless you’re a
masochist, you’ll probably use one of the popular JavaScript frameworks
to develop your app, as will most other web app authors. Rather than
forcing the user to download the same JavaScript library for each web
app, you can reference a shared version of the library that is cached
between apps. Google offers most of the popular libraries on its
CDN^[12](#fn12)^. Twitter uses the Google version of jQuery, so if you
reference the same file, Twitter users that visit your app won’t need to
re-download jQuery.

Optimise traffic overhead
-------------------------

We can also speed things up by reducing the number and size of HTTP and
DNS requests.

Reduce cookie size: the less information stored in a cookie, the less
data is sent with each HTTP request from the browser to the server. Host
static content on a cookieless domain: images, multimedia, JavaScript
and CSS files should be served from a domain or subdomain on which
cookies are not set or valid, to reduce the HTTP header size.

To minimise DNS lookups, files should be served from the same domain,
with the exceptions of a shared CDN domain for libraries, a cookieless
domain for static files, and perhaps specific domains for parallelised
downloads (which we’ll cover shortly). You can further reduce traffic
overhead by enabling Keep-Alives on your web server to support
persistent HTTP connections.

Combine files: where possible, combine scripts or style sheets into a
single file to remove HTTP overhead. Similarly, combine similar small
images into a single image file and use the CSS sprite
technique^[13](#fn13)^ to display them individually.

Optimise code
-------------

By optimising our code, we can generate server-side output faster.

Start with your database queries and structure. Use the **correct data
types** (date fields for dates, and so on) and create **relevant
indexes**, particularly *covered indexes*. A covered index spans all of
the fields necessary to satisfy all the criteria in a `SELECT`
statement.

Your queries should only return the data you need: use the `LIMIT`
clause and avoid `SELECT`\* statements. Built-in **database profiling
tools**, such as explain plans and slow query logs, will identify and
help you to resolve query bottlenecks. Also consider
**denormalising^[14](#fn14)^ data** where appropriate, such as
often-viewed reports that aggregate large amounts of old data that is
unlikely to change.

**Tune the database settings**, which vary between database vendors. At
the minimum, investigate the optimum memory buffer size and query cache
size for your app and hardware combination. These settings specify how
much data is stored and queried in memory rather than on disk, and how
much memory is put aside to store the results of common queries.

**Store session data** and frequently used app cache data in a fast
in-memory datastore like Redis^[15](#fn15)^ or Memcached^[16](#fn16)^.

Optimise rendering
------------------

There are many ways to help the browser fetch, store and display content
more efficiently.

**Minimise the size of the DOM.** A large number of HTML elements means
a slower download, slower calculation of CSS selectors and slower
JavaScript DOM manipulation. Hundreds of DOM elements is typical;
thousands of DOM elements may need optimisation. Use the JavaScript
console in your web browser to check the number of DOM nodes with
`document.getElementsByTagName('*').length`.

![img-19\_2](img-19_2.jpg)

Using the JavaScript console in Google Chrome to check the number of DOM
elements in Tumblr’s dashboard page.

**Use the DOM efficiently**. Reduce JavaScript DOM access by storing a
cached reference to frequently used DOM elements. Minimise reflows and
repaints by batching DOM changes: create node trees (document fragments)
outside the flow of the main DOM and insert the finished structure into
the DOM in a single update. Prefer interactions that don’t cause a
reflow: a background fade rather than a change in size, for instance.

**Flush the output of dynamic HTML pages** after the `<head>` section.
Most popular programming languages, including PHP and Ruby, provide a
function for flushing the output buffer to the browser. If the `<head>`
section is sent in an initial chunk, the browser can parse the code and
start to download style sheets while the server generates the remainder
of the page.

Include style sheets in the `<head>` and JavaScript files just before
the `</body>` to optimise rendering.

**Parallelise downloads.** If your web app serves a large number of
static files on a single page (map image tiles, perhaps), consider
serving the files from multiple host names to work around the limit of
approximately six simultaneous browser downloads per host. Each
additional host will produce some DNS lookup overhead, so only consider
this option if your app downloads more than ten static files on a page,
and limit the maximum number of hosts to four. Spread files evenly
across the hosts and ensure that any particular file is always served
from the same host to enable caching.

![img-19\_3](img-19_3.jpg)

A Firebug^[17](#fn17)^ report reveals that Google Maps parallelises
downloads across multiple domains.

**Pre-fetch future components.** Use idle time to fetch and cache
images, style sheets or scripts that you expect the user will need
later. This works best when the app has a strict workflow. For example,
a search interface is always followed by a search results page.
Interface components required for the search results page could be
preloaded when the search page `onload` event fires: that is, when the
initial search page components are fully downloaded.

S**pecify the character encoding** in the HTTP headers or as the first
line inside the `<head>` of HTML files to prevent the browser re-parsing
the file.

**Optimise CSS selectors.** Browsers match CSS selectors from right to
left, traversing up the DOM to check the validity of child selectors. To
improve CSS performance, use explicit classes or IDs rather than generic
element selectors and remove unnecessary traversal checks up the
DOM^[18](#fn18)^. For example, the selector `div .container #form-error`
is evaluated from right to left, first by finding elements with the
`#form-error` ID, then checking if they have an ancestor with a
`.container` class, and then finally checking for an ancestor `<div>`
element. This would be faster as a single `#form-error` selector, which
still matches the same element (IDs should only be applied to a single
element on a page) but without the additional checks. As an extra bonus,
you’re reducing the size of the CSS file download by including fewer
characters in the CSS selectors.

Finally, specify image dimensions in the HTML to avoid unnecessary
reflows and repaints when the images load.
