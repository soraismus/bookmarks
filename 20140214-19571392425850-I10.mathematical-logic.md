Forcing is a relative model construction method for models of $ZF$ as a
particular first order theory using models of another first order theory
(forcing companion) that in this case is the theory of partial orders
($PO$).

Obviously if we define a uniform "forcing companion theory" $S$ for an
arbitrary first order theory $T$ then in many cases when countable
models of $T$ are not too board up to isomorphism the "forcing theory of
$T$" is just a trivial method and produces no interesting models of $T$.
But in this question my focus is on first order theories with wild
countable and countable models like $ZF$ and $PA$.

One of the most robust ways to understand forcing is via the method of
Boolean ultrapowers, and this is a purely model-theoretic construction
that makes sense to undertake with any first-order theory whatsoever.
One may form the Boolean ultrapower of any graph, group, ring, field,
partial order, and indeed of any structure in any first-order language
whatsoever.

The general construction of the Boolean ultrapower has classical roots
(due in set theory Vopenka, developed also by Solovay, Scott and others
including a very nice presentation by Bell, but also as a purely
model-theoretic construction by Mansfield and others), and a general
introductory account can be found in my paper [Well-founded Boolean
ultrapowers as large cardinal
embeddings](http://jdh.hamkins.org/boolean-ultrapowers/), written
jointly with Dan Seabold.

One may consider the general class of $\\mathbb{B}$-valued models in a
given first-order language. Specifically, a *$\\mathbb{B}$-valued
structure* in a first-order language (not necessarily set-theoretic)
consists of a set of objects $M$, called *names*, and an assignment
$[\\![\\tau=\\sigma]\\!]\\in\\mathbb{B}$ giving the Boolean value that
any two names are equal, as well as the Boolean value $[\\![R(\\vec
\\sigma)]\\!]\\in\\mathbb{B}$ that a given relation holds at a tuple of
names, such that the laws of equality hold with respect to these
assignments (and one can also handle function symbols and constants).
The basic fact is that the concept of a Boolean-valued model is not
particularly connected with set theory, and makes sense for models in
any first-order language.

For any such $\\mathbb{B}$-valued structure, whether it is group, ring,
field, partial order or model of set theory, one may collapse it to a
classial structure by taking the quotient by an arbitrary ultrafilter on
$\\mathbb{B}$. Specifically, if $U\\subset\\mathbb{B}$ is an ultrafilter
(no need for any genericity), then one defines $\\sigma=\_U\\tau$ for
names just in case $[\\![\\sigma=\\tau]\\!]\\in U$. This is an
equivalence relation, indeed a congruence, and one defines the structure
on the resulting quotient structure $R([\\sigma]\_U)$ just in case
$[\\![R(\\sigma)]\\!]\\in U$, which is well-defined because the equality
axioms had Boolean value one. In this way, any $\\mathbb{B}$-valued
structure is transformed into a classical $2$-valued structure by the
quotient.

Thus, we have a generalization of the classical ultrapower construction
from ultrapowers on a power set algebra to arbitrary ultrapowers on a
complete Boolean algebra, and this is known as the Boolean ultrapower.
Specifically, if you have a first-order structure $\\cal M=\\langle
M,\\ldots\\rangle$ and a complete Boolean algebra $\\mathbb{B}$, then
consider the set of *spanning* functions $f:D\\to M$, where $D$ is any
open dense set in $\\mathbb{B}$. Define
$[\\![R(f)]\\!]=\\bigvee\\{R(f(b))\\mid b\\in\\text{dom}(f)\\}$, and
this produces a Boolean-valued model. If $U\\subset\\mathbb{B}$ is an
ultrafilter in $\\mathbb{B}$, define $f=\_Ug$ for two spanning functions
$f:D\\to M$, $g:E\\to m$, if $\\bigvee\\{b\\in\\mathbb{B}\\mid
f(b)=g(b)\\}\\in U$, and let ${\\cal M}\^{\\downarrow\\mathbb{B}}/U$.
This is an equivalence relation, and we may consider the set of spanning
functions modulo this relation $M\^{\\downarrow\\mathbb{B}}/U$. For any
relation $R$ in the language, we define the interpretation of $R$ on
this structure by $R([f]\_U)$ holds if and only if $\\bigvee\\{b\\mid
{\\cal M}\\models R(f(b))\\}\\in U$. One may similarly handle constants
and functions as explained in the paper. If $U\\subset\\mathbb{B}$ is an
ultrafilter, then the corresponding Boolean ultrapower map is the map
$x\\mapsto[c\_x]\_U$, where $c\_x$ is the constant map on $\\mathbb{B}$
with value $x$. This is a generalization of the ordinary ultrapower
construction from ultrafilters on power set algebras to ultafilters on
arbitrary complete Boolean algebras.

The connection with forcing is that for any complete Boolean algebra
$\\mathbb{B}$, we may construct the $\\mathbb{B}$-valued model
$V\^{\\mathbb{B}}$, whose objects are the $\\mathbb{B}$-names with
Boolean-valued truth defined in the usual forcing manner. If
$U\\subset\\mathbb{B}$ is any ultrafilter (not necessarily generic in
any sense), then one gets an elementary embedding $j:V\\to \\check
V\_U\\subset \\check V\_U[[\\dot G]\_U]\\cong V\^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$, which
is precisely the Boolean ultrapower map of $V$ into the ground model of
the Boolean extension $V\^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$ quotiented by the ultrafilter
$U$.

One should think of the Boolean ultrapower construction as a
generalization of the ultrapower construction, which might be thought of
as an *averaging* method, a method of producing homogeneous non-special
models, rather than special models. – [Joel David

The idea of interpreting forcing in Boolean valued version in order to
generalize it to an arbitrary first order theory is very interesting.
Did you construct any *special* model of a first order theory using this
method before? By "special" I mean something like a special group,
graph, field, etc. For example can we think about producing
counterexamples using this kind of forcing for essential problems like
finding a field which refutes Zilber's tricotomy conjecture in a
different way from Hrushovski construction, etc? –

Oh! I think I used the word "special" in an inappropriate way here. I
didn't mean *special models* in the model theoretic sense. I meant a
*model with a special property* as same as set theory that we use
forcing to produce models of ZF with special properties. –
