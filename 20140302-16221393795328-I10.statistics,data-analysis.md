![NewImage](http://ninazumel.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/newimage.png?w=630)

There’s been a buzz the last few days about the [715 new planets that
NASA has
verified](http://www.universetoday.com/109764/mega-discovery-715-alien-planets-confirmed-using-a-new-trick-on-old-kepler-data/),
using data from the Kepler Space Telescope. This discovery doubles the
number of known planets, and turned up four new planets that could
possibly support life.

Beyond the sheer joy of the discovery, one of the interesting aspects of
this announcement is the statistical technique that NASA scientists used
to winnow out so many planets from the data in bulk: *verification by
multiplicity*. Using this technique, scientists can verify the presence
of suspected planets around a star sooner, without having to wait for
additional measurements and observations.

I got curious: what is verification by multiplicity? I’m no astronomer,
but it’s not too difficult to grasp the basic statistical reasoning
behind the method, as described in Lissauer et al. “Almost All of
Kepler’s Multiple Planet Candidates Are Planets,” to be published in
*The Astrophysical Journal* on March 10 (a
[preprint](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.5424v1.pdf) is available at
arxiv.org). My discussion isn’t exactly what the researchers did, and I
stay with a simple case and avoid the actual astrophysics, but it gets
the idea across. I’ll use R to work the example, but you should be able
to follow the discussion even if you’re not familiar with that
programming language.

**The need for statistical verification**

From what I understand of the introduction to the paper, there are two
ways to determine whether or not a planet candidate is really a planet:
the first is to confirm the fact with additional measurements of the
target star’s gravitational wobble, or by measurements of the transit
times of the apparent planets across the face of the star. Getting
sufficient measurements can take time. The other way is to “validate”
the planet by showing that it’s highly unlikely that the sighting was a
false positive. Specifically, the probability that the signal observed
was caused by a planet should be at least 100 times larger than the
probability that the signal is a false positive. The validation analysis
is a Bayesian approach that considers various mechanisms that produce
false positives, determines the probability that these various
mechanisms could have produced the signal in question, and compares them
to the probability that a planet produced the signal.

The basic idea behind verification by multiplicity is that planets are
often clustered in multi-planet star systems, while false positive
measurements (mistaken identification of potential planets) occur
randomly. Putting this another way: if false positives are random, then
they won’t tend to occur together near the same star. So if you observe
a star with multiple “planet signals,” it’s unlikely that *all* the
signals are false positives. We can use that observation to quantify how
much more likely it is that a star with multiple candidates actually
hosts a planet. The resulting probability can be used as an improved
prior for the planet model when doing the statistical validation
described above.

**Some quantities of interest**

Before we start the discussion, some terminology.

Let `ncandidates` be the number of potential planets, `ntargets` be the
number of stars that we’ve observed, and `nmulti` be the number of stars
that appear to have multiple planets. We’ll use the same numbers used in
Lissauer, et.al.

    ncandidates = 1199 # number of potential planets
    nmulti = 170 # number of potential multiplanet systems
    ntargets = 160171 # number of targets (stars observed)

We are also interested in the number of stars that have a single
candidate, how many have exactly two candidate planets, how many have
three or more, and the number of planet candidates associated with each
group.

    # number of "doubles": systems with 2 candidates (given in paper)
    n2Obs = 115 
    # number of candidates in 2-candidate systems
    nplanets2Obs = 230 
    # no. of "triple_pluses": stars with 3+ candidates (given in paper)
    n3plusObs = 55 
    # number of candidates in 3+ candidate systems (given in paper)
    nplanets3Obs = 178 

    # number of stars with a single candidate (derived)
    nSingleton = ncandidates-(nplanets2Obs+nplanets3Obs)
    # 791

    # number of stars with at least one candidate planet (derived)
    nCandSystems = nSingleton+n2Obs+n3plusObs
    # 961

We also have to estimate two values. First, `P`, the fraction of
candidates that are actually planets. In this discussion, I’ll use
`P = 0.5`, which is a pessimal assumption; in reality (according to the
authors) the `P` is probably more like 0.9. Second, the prior
probability that a star has a planet, `priorHasPlanet`. In this
discussion we’ll use `priorHasPlanet = P * nCandSystems/ntargets`, which
is about 0.003, or 0.3%, if we assume that `P = 0.5`. The estimate that
Lissauer, et al. use is `P * ncandidates/ntargets`, which is a little
more generous, since it assumes that every candidate is attached to a
different star. For the value of `P` that we are using, the researchers’
estimate (0.37%) is not too different from ours.

**The statistics**

The method depends on two basic assumptions: First, that false positives
are randomly distributed among the star systems observed. Second, that
false positives and true observations are uncorrelated. Specifically, we
assume that the false positives are [Poisson
distributed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) with an
intensity `lambda = (1-P)(ncandidates/ntargets)`. The Poisson
distribution gives the probability of observing `n` instances of an
event that occurs at a rate `lambda` within a unit of space or time. In
our case, the “unit” is a single star, so the Poisson measures the
probability of seeing `n` false positives around a star; multiply that
by `ntarget`, and we get the expected number of stars that will display
`n`\
 false positives.

    # estimate of the FP intensity  -> number of FPs per system
    lambda = (1-P)*(ncandidates/ntargets)
    # [1] 0.003742875

    #
    # model false positives as a poisson w/ 
    # intensity lambda 
    #
    probFP = function(n, lamb=lambda) {
      dpois(n, lamb)
    }

    # display number of expected stars with n false positives (FPs), 
    # after examining ntargets stars
    fps = probFP(0:5)*ntargets
    names(fps) = 0:5

    # resulting values (rounded to 3 decimal points)
    # 
    # 0         1         2         3         4         5 
    # 1.596e+05 5.973e+02 1.118e+00 1.395e-03 1.305e-06 9.768e-10 
    #
    # most stars by far have no FPs at all, the rest will have 1 or 2
    #

Suppose we see a star with a single candidate (a “singleton”). What’s
the probability that this candidate is a planet? It’s the complement of
the conditional probability that the signal is a false positive,
conditioned on the probability of observing a singleton.

    # prob. that signal is an FP, conditioned on only seeing one signal
    p1 = probFP(1)/(nSingleton/ntargets)
    # [1] 0.75507  -- so 25% chance it's a planet

In English: we observed 791 “singleton” stars. Under our Poisson
assumption, we would expect to see about 597 singleton false positives
when observing `ntargets` stars. That means that about 597/791, or 0.75
of our observations are probably false positives, and only about 25% of
them are really planets.

What if we see a star with two candidates (a “double”)? There are three
cases: both observations are false positives; one observation is a false
positive; or both observations are planets. The probability of the first
case:

    # prob of seeing 2 FPs, conditioned on seeing 2 signals
    p2_2fps = probFP(2)/(n2Obs/ntargets)
    # [1] 0.009719438  -- 0.97%

To get the probability of the second case, we use the assumption that
false positives and planets are uncorrelated, so the probability of
seeing both is the product of the two individual probabilities.

    # prob of seeing 1 FP and 1 planet, conditioned on seeing 2 signals
    p2_1fp = probFP(1)*priorHasPlanet/(n2Obs/ntargets)
    # [1] 0.01558028

The chance of seeing two false positives near a single star is quite
low, about a percent. That means with 99% probability, this star has at
least one planet! That’s a much higher probability than our prior of
0.3%. In fact, the most likely scenario is that both signals are
planets: `1 - (p2_2fps + p2_1fp)`{style="line-height:1.5em;"}, or 0.974.

What’s the probability that a given signal is a planet? It’s the
probability of being in case 3 (2 planets), plus one half times the
probability of being in case 2 (1 planet, 1 FP).

    # prob. that a signal is a planet, conditioned on seeing 2 signals
    p2planets = 1 - (p2_2fps+p2_1fp)
    p2planets + 0.5*p2_1fp
    # [1] 0.9824904 -- 98.2% chance it's a planet

You can do something similar with “triple\_plus” stars; it’s more
complicated, but the idea is the same.

These boosts in probability are dramatic, but they depend on several
assumed values: `P`, `lambda`, and `priorHasPlanet`. However, the
general idea holds: observing multiple false positives around a single
star is unlikely, so a star with multiple candidates has an elevated
probability of hosting planets, and using the “no information” prior
(0.003, in our case) for doing the validation analysis is not optimal.
So it looks like what the researchers actually did (despite having gone
through a set of calculations similar to the ones above) is to use the
empirical counts of stars with multiple candidates to estimate
appropriate (and somewhat more conservative) “multiplicity boosts” to
the prior. This sort of makes sense; most stars with only one candidate
will be false positives; most stars with multiple candidates will host
planets (just not necessarily as many planets as there are signals). The
boost in signals should mirror the boost in planet probability.

    # prob. that star has a candidate
    p1 = nCandSystems/ntargets
    # 0.005999838, or roughly 1/167

    # prob. star w/ at least 1 candidate hosts another
    p2plus = (n2Obs+n3plusObs)/nCandSystems
    # [1] 0.1768991, or roughly 1/6

    # prob. star w/ at least 2 candidates hosts another
    p3plus = n3plusObs/(n2Obs+n3plusObs)
    # [1] 0.3235294, or roughly 1/3

    # multiplicity boost for observing 2 signals
    p2plus/p1
    # [1] 29.48397

    # multiplicity boost for observing 3+ signals
    p3plus/p1
    # [1] 53.92303

So, when you are validating a candidate from a star with two candidates,
you boost the prior probability of being a planet by a factor of about
30 from the “no information” prior; when you are validating a candidate
from a star with three or more candidates, you boost the prior by a
factor of about 50. The resulting boosts are apparently enough to
validate several more planets than ever before, without needing to take
more measurements.

Of course, there are all sorts of caveats. Is the assumption that false
positives and planets are uncorrelated valid? When? The Poisson model
also assumes that false positives are uncorrelated with each other. Is
that assumption valid? There are additional issues around associating
candidates with the wrong star, and the signals produced by binary or
multiple star systems. But that’s all astrophysics, and outside my
expertise. The statistics presented in the paper, however, is quite
straightforward.

    Putting together the error probabilities (e.g., of false positives)
    is the basis for the necessary “argument from coincidence”, when
    warranted. It is a frequentist (error statistical) analysis. I don’t
    see that the conventional prior is doing any work.
