In his fourth-floor lab at Harvard University, [Michael
Desai](http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/desai/) has created hundreds
of identical worlds in order to watch evolution at work. Each of his
meticulously controlled environments is home to a separate strain of
baker’s yeast. Every 12 hours, Desai’s robot assistants pluck out the
fastest-growing yeast in each world — selecting the fittest to live on —
and discard the rest. Desai then monitors the strains as they evolve
over the course of 500 generations. His experiment, which other
scientists say is unprecedented in scale, seeks to gain insight into a
[question](http://www.simonsfoundation.org/quanta/20140717-the-new-science-of-evolutionary-forecasting/)
that has long bedeviled biologists: If we could start the world over
again, would life evolve the same way?

*Sergey Kryazhimskiy*

Michael Desai, a biologist at Harvard University, uses statistical
methods to study basic questions in evolution.

Many biologists argue that it would not, that chance mutations early in
the evolutionary journey of a species will profoundly influence its
fate. “If you replay the tape of life, you might have one initial
mutation that takes you in a totally different direction,” Desai said,
paraphrasing an idea first put forth by the biologist Stephen Jay Gould
in the 1980s.

Desai’s yeast cells call this belief into question. According to results
[published](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24970088) in Science in
June, all of Desai’s yeast varieties arrived at roughly the same
evolutionary endpoint (as measured by their ability to grow under
specific lab conditions) regardless of which precise genetic path each
strain took. It’s as if 100 New York City taxis agreed to take separate
highways in a race to the Pacific Ocean, and 50 hours later they all
converged at the Santa Monica pier.

The findings also suggest a disconnect between evolution at the genetic
level and at the level of the whole organism. Genetic mutations occur
mostly at random, yet the sum of these aimless changes somehow creates a
predictable pattern. The distinction could prove valuable, as much
genetics research has focused on the impact of mutations in individual
genes. For example, researchers often ask how a single mutation might
affect****a microbe’s****tolerance for toxins, or a****human’s risk for
a disease. But if Desai’s findings hold true in other organisms, they
could suggest that it’s equally important to examine how large numbers
of individual genetic changes work in concert over time.

“There’s a kind of tension in evolutionary biology between thinking
about individual genes and the potential for evolution to change the
whole organism,” said [Michael
Travisano](http://www.cbs.umn.edu/explore/departments/eeb/faculty-research/directory/michael-travisano),
a biologist at the University of Minnesota. “All of biology has been
focused on the importance of individual genes for the last 30 years, but
the big take-home message of this study is that’s not necessarily
important.”

*Sergey Kryazhimskiy*

To efficiently analyze many strains of yeast simultaneously, scientists
grow them on plates like this one, which has 96 individual wells.

The key strength in Desai’s experiment is its unprecedented size, which
has been described by others in the field as “audacious.” The
experiment’s design is rooted in its creator’s background; Desai trained
as a physicist, and from the time he launched his lab four years ago, he
applied a statistical perspective to biology. He devised ways to use
robots to precisely manipulate hundreds of lines of yeast so that he
could run large-scale evolutionary experiments in a quantitative way.
Scientists have long studied the genetic evolution of microbes, but
until recently, it was possible to examine only a few strains at a time.
Desai’s team, in contrast, analyzed 640 lines of yeast that had all
evolved from a single parent cell. The approach allowed the team to
statistically analyze evolution.

“This is the physicist’s approach to evolution, stripping down
everything to the simplest possible conditions,” said [Joshua
Plotkin](http://mathbio.sas.upenn.edu/), an evolutionary biologist at
the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the research but
has worked with one of the authors. “They could partition how much of
evolution is attributable to chance, how much to the starting point, and
how much to measurement noise.”

Fluid-handling robots like this one make it possible to study hundreds
of lines of yeast over many generations.

Desai’s plan was to track the yeast strains as they grew under identical
conditions and then compare their final fitness levels, which were
determined by how quickly they grew in comparison to their original
ancestral strain. The team employed specially designed robot arms to
transfer yeast colonies to a new home every 12 hours. The colonies that
had grown the most in that period advanced to the next round, and the
process repeated for 500 generations. [Sergey
Kryazhimskiy](http://sergeykryazhimskiy.webs.com/), a postdoctoral
researcher in Desai’s lab, sometimes spent the night in the lab,
analyzing the fitness of each of the 640 strains at three different
points in time. The researchers could then compare how much fitness
varied among strains, and find out whether a strain’s initial
capabilities affected its final standing. They also sequenced the
genomes of 104 of the strains to figure out whether early mutations
changed the ultimate performance.

Previous studies have indicated that small changes early in the
evolutionary journey can lead to big differences later on, an idea known
as historical contingency. Long-term [evolution
studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22992527) in E. coli
bacteria, for example, found that the microbes can sometimes evolve to
eat a new type of food, but that such substantial changes only happen
when certain enabling mutations happen first. These early mutations
don’t have a big effect on their own, but they lay the necessary
groundwork for later mutations that do.

But because of the small scale of such studies, it wasn’t clear to Desai
whether these cases were the exception or the rule. “Do you typically
get big differences in evolutionary potential that arise in the natural
course of evolution, or for the most part is evolution predictable?” he
said. “To answer this we needed the large scale of our experiment.”

As in previous studies, Desai found that early mutations influence
future evolution, shaping the path the yeast takes. But in Desai’s
experiment, that path didn’t affect the final destination. “This
particular kind of contingency actually makes fitness evolution more
predictable, not less,” Desai said.

Desai found that just as a single trip to the gym benefits a couch
potato more than an athlete, microbes that started off growing slowly
gained a lot more from beneficial mutations than their fitter
counterparts that shot out of the gate. “If you lag behind at the
beginning because of bad luck, you’ll tend to do better in the future,”
Desai said. He compares this phenomenon to the economic principle of
diminishing returns — after a certain point, each added unit of effort
helps less and less.

Scientists don’t know why all genetic roads in yeast seem to arrive at
the same endpoint, a question that Desai and others in the field find
particularly intriguing. The yeast developed mutations in many different
genes, and scientists found no obvious link among them, so it’s unclear
how these genes interact in the cell, if they do at all. “Perhaps there
is another layer of metabolism that no one has a handle on,” said Vaughn
Cooper, a biologist at the University of New Hampshire who was not
involved in the study.

It’s also not yet clear whether Desai’s carefully controlled results are
applicable to more complex organisms or to the chaotic real world, where
both the organism and its environment are constantly changing. “In the
real world, organisms get good at different things, partitioning the
environment,” Travisano said. He predicts that populations within those
ecological niches would still be subject to diminishing returns,
particularly as they undergo adaptation. But it remains an open
question, he said.

Nevertheless, there are hints that complex organisms can also quickly
evolve to become more alike. A study
[published](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788553) in May analyzed
groups of genetically distinct fruit flies as they adapted to a new
environment. Despite traveling along different evolutionary
trajectories, the groups developed similarities in attributes such as
fecundity and body size after just 22 generations. “I think many people
think about one gene for one trait, a deterministic way of evolution
solving problems,” said [David
Reznick](http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Reznick.html), a
biologist at the University of California, Riverside. “This says that’s
not true; you can evolve to be better suited to the environment in many
ways.”

    I notice that the \*external\* characteristics (fecundity etc.) are
    said to match, whether yeast or fruit flies.

    However, the next important question is: Just how much and where do
    the genomes of each line that reaches the finish differ?
