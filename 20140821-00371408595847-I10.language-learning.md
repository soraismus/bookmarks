*I set out to feature the best and youngest polyglots the internet had
to offer. The more videos of kids speaking more languages than they had
candles on their birthday cake, the better. What I found instead was a
thoughtful community of linguists chastising the media for
sensationalizing genius (oops) and obscuring what's important: language
learning.*

[![meet-the-polyglots](http://www.languagetrainers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/meet-the-polyglots.png)](http://www.languagetrainers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/meet-the-polyglots.png "Meet the Polyglots: the Linguistic Geniuses Out to Change the Way You Think")

This talented group of polyglots of all ages democratically leads
language-loving legions. They use their popularity to promote
humanitarian multilingual agendas, lifting the practice of language
learning out of academic exercise and harnessing the power of the global
internet to get the largest and most diverse group of people doing what
they all agree matters most: connecting.

“Adventures of a Teenage Polyglot”
----------------------------------

In the spring of 2012, a host of media outlets hailed Tim Doner as the
world's youngest polyglot. Then 16, inspired by studying Hebrew for his
bar mitzvah, he had spent three years teaching himself over 20
languages. [The New York Times
story](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/nyregion/a-teenage-master-of-languages-finds-online-fellowship.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)
honed in on how the internet "changed the metabolism of his language
study...Suddenly, Timothy had people to talk to in all his languages —
not just native speakers, but also people like himself, who were
interested in language for its own sake, a small but vibrant subculture
of language geeks."

As society greases the YouTube channels, this subculture has gotten
larger and even more vibrant, and it's no surprise that two years later
polyglots like Doner influence the online language learning community.
Along with the ability to improve language skills and make friends based
on shared interest, the internet presents polyglots with a platform for
global networking. Speakers of multiple upon multiple languages enter a
space where proficiency translates to authority and traffic. Lucky for
the community, members of this talented group tend to share a
humanitarian philosophy.

“Breaking the Language Barrier”
-------------------------------

Early this spring, Doner gave a talk at TEDxTeen 2014, which he starts
by reflecting on a somewhat negative experience with the media back in
2012. Though glad to see language learning get more attention, he was
disappointed when instead of inquiring how and why he learned so many
languages reporters and talk-show hosts called upon him to perform, to
introduce himself in Russian or come out with a Chinese tongue twister.
"Up next a skateboarding bulldog in a bathing suit," he quipped
reenacting an exaggerated version of his interviews, not so much
offended by being treated as a trick pony as disturbed by an approach to
the issue that portrays learning language as a task. Engaging Doner as
someone trying to get into the Guinness Book of World Records cheapens
what it means to speak a language, which he identifies as "a lot more
than knowing words out of the dictionary."

Doner's approach to language is soulful and political. A New Yorker,
he's blown away by the number of languages he hears on the street, but
for all that linguistic diversity he observes how mainstream American
culture remains monolingual. He nods to the controversy surrounding
Coke's Super Bowl 2014 commercial, a multilingual rendition of "America
the Beautiful.” Donor points to the connection between language and
thought and advocates cultural immersion to expand the mind; you have to
understand the culture to understand the phrase, or, as Doner says, "you
can translate words easily, but you can't quite translate meaning."

Polyglots vs. Hyperglots
------------------------

In "Breaking the Language Barrier," Doner invites his audience to change
the way they think about language and language learning, and ultimately
makes a practical pitch for trying a new language. Part of his talk even
consists of sharing fun language-learning tips. Truth is, it's not
unreasonable to expect audience members to pick up a language or even a
few. A polyglot is simply defined as a multilingual person. Scientists
agree that to be a polyglot requires a threshold of natural talent, but
beyond that the learner needs only desire and discipline. Doner doesn't
want to be the exception; that's precisely what it's not about.

That said, while many can learn multiple languages, you don't often see
people familiarizing themselves with the Arabic alphabet in a matter of
days: a talent like Doner's is special. (His TED talk touches on how he
was a child actor with a knack for accents and impressions -- linguistic
talent flag numero uno.) For linguists of a certain caliber, professor
Richard Hudson at the University College London coined the term
"hyperglot" to refer to someone who can speak six or more languages
fluently. Some only apply "hyperglot" to extreme cases, linguists who
speak anywhere from 12 to 50 languages.

When it comes to these most extreme cases, there are recognized leaders
around the world, [17 Notable Living
Polyglots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_polyglots) listed on
Wikipedia and a handful of others who repeatedly come out on top in
[forums for rating the "World's Best
Polyglots."](http://www.lingq.com/forum/1/14626/) Richard Simcott,
fluent in 16 languages and versed in over 30, was [identified as
Britain's most multilingual adult by Harper Collins
UK](http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/news-and-contacts/news-details/136/collins-most-multilingual);
his YouTube videos were early inspiration for Doner. Former Canadian
diplomat Steven Kaufmann speaks 11 languages and counting. Luca
Lampariello of Rome speaks 12.

It's Not a Competition, It's a Calling
--------------------------------------

Those seriously in contention for the title of "World's Greatest
Polyglot" will be the first to point out that in this category the
criteria for "best" is hard to define. Should poly- and hyper-glots be
judged on the number of languages they speak or on their level of
fluency? Are certain languages more inherently "difficult" than others?
No uncontroversial definition for mastery of language exists. Moreover,
individuals who've invested their lives in learning languages will also
be first to tell you it's not a competition. Ranking polyglots engages
in the same kind of small-mindedness of which Doner accused the media.

These high-profile polyglots are more concerned with missions to promote
multilingualism than they are with competing. There is a long tradition
of polyglots as scholars and authors, and in this digital age many turn
to the web to galvanize the global community. Kaufmann co-founded The
Linguist Institute Learning Company and actively runs his blog, [The
Linguist](http://blog.thelinguist.com). Simcott and Lampariello were
both[singled out by the Mezzofanti Guild, an Online Community of Serious
Language Learners](http://www.mezzoguild.com/language-bloggers/), as
prolific language learning bloggers to follow. A self-proclaimed
Multilingual Ambassador, Simcott wants his blog, [Speaking
Fluently](http://speakingfluently.com/), to be the most useful possible
tool for language learners and in that spirit invites visitors to shape
the content. Lampariello dedicates [his
blog](http://www.thepolyglotdream.com/) to his "greatest passion,
languages," and professes that "If anyone tells you that just knowing
English is enough tell him 'he who learns another language acquires
another soul.'"

Together, Simcott and Lampariello founded the international [Polyglot
Conference](http://polyglotconference.com/), held for the first time in
Budapest, Hungary in 2013, and scheduled this year for October 10-12 in
Novi Sad, Serbia. They aimed to bring together in real life the world's
polyglots alongside those with true passion for language. They
acknowledge how over the course of five years engaging language learners
online the community has "grown from strength to strength," and hope the
conference will "take this to the next level.”

Unless It Is a Competition
--------------------------

While the heavyweights insist language learning isn't a competition,
they've discovered that friendly competition is a great way to inspire
newcomers, motivate the existing community, and gain exposure for
language learning in general. On Speaking Fluently, Simcott references
[MehrsprachICH](%20http://www.goethe.de/ges/spa/prj/mes/enindex.htm), a
video competition launched by Germany's Goethe Institute. They challenge
speakers of multiple languages in the hopes that they publicize the
"positive impact that knowledge of different languages can have on your
own development and on your co-existence with others." [The Goethe
Institute collaborates with the European Union National Institutes for
Culture in Brussels and the
Poliglotti4.eu](%A0http://www.goethe.de/ges/spa/prj/mes/uep/enindex.htm)
to promote multilingualism on the continent, underscoring how learning
language "opens doors and broadens horizons." The
[Poliglotti4.eu](http://www.poliglotti4.eu) project came out of the
Civil Society Platform on Multilingualism, working on behalf of the
European Commission. Their goals include developing and implementing
multilingual policy "at grassroots level everywhere in Europe."

On the heels of his TED Talk, Doner came out with his own competition,
the "Teen Polyglot Challenge." On March 1, 2014, he released a video on
his YouTube Channel, Polyglot Pal, inviting young adults ages 13-19 to
spend 30 days teaching themselves the basics of a language using the
internet, books, and music. He asked participants to submit videos of
themselves at the end of this month practicing pronunciation,
intonation, vocabulary, and knowledge of the culture -- "to prove to
themselves and everybody watching that you can teach yourself language
to a reasonable degree in the course of just a month." He received
submissions from impressive teens around the world learning languages
from French to Tetun Dili, and gave out four awards, two in the
Non-European Language category and two in European. As inspiration, he
uploaded all the video submissions, including one of a teen who learned
sign language.

Why Polyglots Make Good Leaders
-------------------------------

Doner makes use of time spent in the media spotlight, drawing on his
youth and talent to inspire other members of his generation. These
polyglots have the power to lead because they have authority in the
language learning space, the kind of authority enabled by the
democratizing agent that is the internet, authority derived from
intellectual merit. But this ability, what separates the individual who
learns 20 languages from the one who knows four, may coincide with other
leadership qualities.

In recent years scholarship has zeroed in on the benefits of being
bilingual: [the NYT
explains](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/opinion/sunday/the-benefits-of-bilingualism.html?_r=0%20)
why bilinguals as smarter; academic research shows [why bilinguals are
more
empathic](http://www.academia.edu/1822299/Multilingualism_empathy_and_multicompetence).
Bilinguals are said to appreciate a more nuanced relationship between
words and meaning; they understand language as a means to an end
(communicating), and that understanding leads to a greater capacity for
empathy for other humans, especially those who are different. If
bilingual individuals see the world in this expanded way, then how
empathic are they who know not two but 20 languages?

Universal Language
------------------

Polyglots are quick to quote Nelson Mandela, a famous hyperglot, leader,
and humanitarian. At the first annual Polyglot Conference and in Doner's
TED Talk, projected onto the screen was Mandela's famous line: "If you
talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head; if
you talk to a man in his language, that goes to his heart." Exploration
of the nature of language betrays the relationship between true cultural
understanding and world peace, between language and thought technology.
Polyglots have had their minds blown by their learning experience; they
see the world differently and they want to inspire others to see the
world similarly.

The internet enables new practical methods for learning language
(recording oneself on YouTube, engaging native speakers and language
enthusiasts to refine skills) but more profoundly invites connection.
"Meeting other language learners today has never been easier," Simcott
proclaims on Speaking Fluently, appreciating what amazing resources are
forums and social media.

Connectivity promotes understanding between cultures that proves
necessary to move forward as a global community, but we run the risk of
coming together by flattening experience rather than embracing our
differences. The Goethe Institute cites how the number of foreign
language learners within Europe declines. In his recent speech, Doner
points out how every two weeks on earth another language dies because of
assimilation, war, or death. These polyglots and policy-makers want to
preserve the integrity of language for the good of future generations,
and how exciting to watch natural-born humanitarian leaders employ the
resources of today's technology to change the future of the way we
communicate.

Ready to Learn?
---------------

If polyglots inspire you to try a totally new language, Doner suggests
you make use of available resources like books, music, and movies to
discover your new culture--by way of acknowledging that true learning
happens in real time, cultural exchange. In other words, when you're
ready to dive deeply into your new language and culture, it's time to
find a conversation partner. The internet connects you to a large pool
of native speakers but it's most important to find someone with whom you
can have extended, meaningful dialogue. Consider the online buddy system
or enlisting the help of native speaker in the form of a [qualified
language tutor](http://www.languagetrainers.com/contact_us.php).
