Chris Rong did everything right. A 23-year-old dentistry student in New
York, Chris excelled at one of the country’s top high
[schools](http://topics.time.com/schools/), breezed through college, and
is now studying dentistry at one of the best dental schools in the
nation.

But it may be a long time before he sees any rewards. He’s moved back
home with his parents in Bayside, Queens—an hour-and-a-half commute each
way to class at the New York University’s College of Dentistry—and by
the time he graduates in 2016, he’ll face $400,000 in student loans. “If
the money weren’t a problem I would live on my own,” says Rong. “My debt
is hanging over my mind. I’m taking that all on myself.”

Rong isn’t alone. Across the country, students are taking on
increasingly large amounts of debt to pay for heftier education
tuitions. Figures released last week by the [Federal
Reserve](http://topics.time.com/federal-reserve/) of New York show that
aggregate student loans nationwide have continued to rise. At the end of
2003, American students and graduates owed just $253 billion in
aggregate debt; by the end of 2013, American students’ debt had
ballooned to a total of $1.08 trillion, an increase of over 300%. In the
past year alone, aggregate [student
debt](http://topics.time.com/student-debt/) grew 10%. By comparison,
overall debt grew just 43% in the last decade and 1.6% over the past
year.

According to a December study by the Institute for College Access &
Success, seven out of 10 students in the class of 2012 graduated with
student loans, and the average amount of debt among students who owed
was $29,400. There’s no clear end in sight. ”The total amount of student
debt is growing basically at a constant rate,” Wilbert van der Klaauw,
an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York tells TIME. “The
inflow is much higher than the outflow, which is likely to continue in
the future as reliance on student loans for college is expected to
remain high.”

Debt is painful for many students, and an increasing number of graduates
are unable to pay back their loans on time. Delinquencies on student
loans have risen dramatically over the past decade: 11.5 percent of
graduates were at least 90 days late on paying back their loans at the
end of 2013, compared with 6.2 percent delinquencies on student loans in
2003. Moreover, the Fed’s figures on delinquencies hide more stark data:
nearly half of all students with debt aren’t currently in repayment
thanks to deferments and forbearances and the fact that students are not
expected to pay while they’re in school, according to van der Klaauw.
What that means is that for the graduates who are actually expected to
pay their loans now, the delinquency rate is roughly double the 11.5%
figure.

![StudentLoansHERE1](http://timebusinessblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/studentloanshere1.png?w=600)

Federal Reserve Bank of New York

Delinquencies on student loans rose to 11.5% in the last quarter of
2013, even as credit card and mortgage delinquencies fell. Evidence
suggests that student loan delinquencies for graduates actually expected
to make payments are far higher.

Why are student debts and delinquencies continuing to rise? One answer
is that the cost of higher educations is increasing. Between the
2000-2001 academic year and the 2010-2011 academic year, the annual cost
of a degree at public and private 2- and 4-year institutions rose 70%,
from an average of $10,820 to $18,497, according to data provided by the
federal government’s Institute of Education Sciences. Families’ incomes
aren’t rising at the same rate, so students are forced to take out more
loans.

On the plus side, more students than ever before are attending college,
which is a certainly a good thing, as van der Klaauw points out, even if
it is a contributing to factor to overall debt increasing. A degree is
usually worth the cost of college, even if the price tag is increasingly
tough to bear. “It is always important to keep in mind that the average
returns to a college degree remain high,” van der Klaauw says.

But a more pernicious explanation of rising debts is that outstanding
student loans tends to linger for years, as interest rates accumulate
debt and students decide to pay off other loans first. Student debt
piles on because it takes years to pay them off, and they can’t afford
to pay back such hefty loans until later in their careers. For example,
some dentistry school graduates sometimes intentionally choose to
default on their student loans in order to pay the staggeringly high
costs of opening their own dental practice, Rong says.

For Rong, avoiding default on his $400,000 student loans may involve
some clever thinking once he graduates. Rong says he’s entertained the
idea of joining the military, or moving to a state with no income tax,
like Texas, so he can pay off his debts more quickly. “I was just going
to stay in New York after graduating, but now I realize there’s so much
on my plate,” he explains. “When you take out loans, you’re taking years
off of what you want to do and where you really want to be.”

Students across the country are trapped by their debts and often unable
to take advantage of the freedom that a college degree should
theoretically afford them. Julia Handel is the marketing manager for
celebrity New York chef David Burke. The 2012 Ithaca College graduate is
making over $40,000 a year, which is better than many of her friends.
But she had $75,000 in loans, and it’ll take her at least 15 years to
pay off her debts. For now, Handel is officially on her parents’ lease
but crashing with her boyfriend, pinching pennies and paying back $700
every month. She may have to give up her dream of going to culinary
school, and at this point, she can definitely cross off the idea of
renting her own apartment.

By the time Handel pays off her loans, she may be nearly 40. “Whenever I
do anything, loans are always in the back of my mind,” she says. “It
controls what I do every day and what I spend my money on.”

Student debt doesn’t just weigh heavily on graduates. Evidence is
growing that student loans may be dragging down the overall economy, not
just individuals. Think about it this way: if students have significant
debts, it means they’re less likely to spend money on other goods and
services, and it also means they’re less likely to take out a mortgage
on a house. Consumer purchasing is the primary driver of the U.S.
economy, and mortgages and auto loans play a huge role as well. There
aren’t any comprehensive, hard numbers yet on how much of a drag student
debt may be on the economy, but “the associations definitely suggest
that growing student debt is a drag on consumption,” says van der
Klaauw. “This is still something we’re discussing. There are a range of
views on this. My personal view is that the increasing reliance on
student loans for financing college education is going to be a drag on
consumption for some time.”

Knowing the kind of debt he’ll face once he graduates, Rong says he
rarely goes to happy hours, and Handel says she’s much less likely to
get regular haircuts, schedule doctor prompt doctors’ appointments, or
buy the small things that add up—and, in aggregate, eventually prop up
the economy and drive GDP growth. “It’s the little things,” she says.
“Putting off a haircut for a long time, getting more makeup,
prescriptions, or doctors appointments, the things that I don’t even
think cost money but end up adding up a lot.”

It’s also become harder and harder to qualify for a mortgage if you have
student loans, says Andrew Haughwout, another economist with the New
York Federal Reserve. Banks tightened their underwriting standards after
recession and are now much less willing to grant house and auto loans at
low-interest rates, particularly for graduates with more debt than ever
before. That’s slowing down the housing recovery and the construction
markets.

In 2005, before the Great Recession, having student loans was a good
indicator that a graduate also had a mortgage. Student loans usually
indicated a higher level of education, a higher salary, and better
credit-worthiness. Better-educated, higher-earning people were more
likely to take have the capital and the wherewithal to take out a
mortgage; but now, that dynamic has changed. Bigger debts mean college
graduates are less likely to take out mortgages than they used to be,
dampening economic growth. “Now that’s kind of gone away, that
relationship,” Haughwout says. “Knowing that someone has student debt
doesn’t tell you very much at all about whether they’re going to have a
mortgage in spite of the fact that it probably still signals higher
level of education.”

Is college still worth it? Yes, without a doubt. But you’re going to
need a lot of patience and a lot of luck, class of 2014.
