Today, after a long time without posting I will show you how to
integrate bower in a Rails application. Many times I was a bit
frustrated when I found a nice lib I want to include in a project but
when I want to find the associated gem, sometimes the lib is not up to
date inside and I have to wait for the new version of the gem… Another
solution is to download the version of the lib you want and put it in
the vendor directory but in that case it can be really boring to
maintain…

Now there is a solution for that thanks to
[Bower](/2014-01-23/what-is-yeoman-part-2-bower).

First step, you have to add the gem
*[bower-rails](https://github.com/42dev/bower-rails)* in your Gemfile
then the classic `bundle` and finish with
`rails g bower_rails:initialize`.

Now you can have a look on your new file in your initializers directory.

config/initializers/bower\_rails.rb

~~~~

    asset 'angular'
    asset 'angular-resource'
    asset 'angular-route'
    asset 'requirejs'

This is an exemple with angular and requirejs loaded. Then you just need
to run the command `rake bower:install` and your bower.json file will be
created/updated and your libs downloaded in your vendor directory. Of
course you can set a specific version, change the destination directory
etc… I’m sure you will have a look on the
[doc](https://github.com/42dev/bower-rails) if you want more details.

Now because the vendor path is in the assets path of rails you can
simply include your files in your application.js file (also your
stylesheets).

application.js

~~~~ {.line-numbers}

    //= require_self
    //= require angular
    //= require angular-resource
    //= require angular-route
    //= require requirejs

That’s it ! So now you can remove all the gems you have for different
lib you use like your twitter-bootstrap, zurb-foundation, backbone,
angular… and just load everything using bower. Maybe the next step will
be to use [Grunt](/2014-01-25/what-is-yeoman-part-3-grunt) instead of
sprockets for my asset pipeline.
