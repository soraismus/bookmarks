Several Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are developing services that manage
consumers' investment portfolios with algorithms rather than people.

Millions of people are turning their thoughts to self-improvement and
New Year's resolutions this week. And one of the most common
resolutions, after promises to lose weight or get in better shape, is to
be better about money.

A handful of entrepreneurs in the Bay Area have taken note — and they
believe the time has come for you to try a different way of managing
your money.

Mike Sha's dream is that one day, you will turn your investments over to
a robot. "A *smart* robot," stresses Sha, who's behind the San
Francisco-based startup [SigFig](https://www.sigfig.com/).

“ If you could replace that human with a machine ... you really can
build a better, more scalable, lower-cost solution.

- Mike Sha of SigFig

We're not talking C-3PO here. What we're really talking about is
algorithms. SigFig has built a website that will manage your portfolio
for you automatically. The site searches out the lowest-fee funds. It
makes sure you invest in a diversified portfolio. It matches the risk of
your investments to your age, to when you want to retire and to your
personal financial goals.

And then it automatically rebalances your investments to fit that plan
over time.

In short, Sha says, it does pretty much everything a human financial
adviser could do.

**But What's Wrong With Human Advisers?**

"Unfortunately, humans are expensive," Sha says. "They can be prone to
bias, based on how they get paid or how much they get paid."

Many personal financial advisers are paid more depending on the stocks
or investments you, the client, buy. Conflicts of interest riddle the
industry. And there are other problems with humans, too.

"They don't scale well, so a person who is trying to manage money for a
couple hundred people, they can't look at everyone's account all the
time," Sha says. "So ... if you could replace that human with a machine
— which has been done in a lot of other industries to great success —
you really can build a better, more scalable, lower-cost solution."

[![Retirement

### [Your Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/your-money/)

### [The Tricky Business Of Retirement: Hidden 401(K) Fees](http://www.npr.org/2013/05/16/184221956/the-tricky-business-of-retirement-hidden-401-k-fees)

SigFig charges a flat fee of $10 a month, not a percentage of the money
it manages or a new fee for each transaction.

And Sha isn't the only entrepreneur pursuing this dream;
[Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/) and
[Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/) do the same thing. And the
tiny little startup Wallet.AI wants to take it a step further.

When Wallet.AI's Omar Green and Boris Fedorov look at someone's
finances, they start with a simple question: "By living the way you are
living, are you adding to your net worth every day or are you
subtracting from it? Are you becoming more cash-flow positive, or less?"
Fedorov says.

[Wallet.AI](http://wallet.ai/) is trying to build a product that will
monitor each and every one of your transactions, then send you text
messages if you start to stray from the virtuous path.

For example, in October, one user started using the ride-sharing service
Uber instead of taxi cabs. Now, catching a ride in an Uber town car is
nice, but it can cost a fair bit more.

"Based on that insight, we were able to determine that they could have
saved over $200 if, for every Uber trip that they took, they took a cab
[instead]," Fedorov says.

So they sent a text message to that user with a heads up. "And it's not
that we have any kind of vendetta against Uber," Fedorov says. But the
data doesn't lie — and now that Uber addict is using Uber about half as
much and saving about $100 a month.

No human financial adviser would ever have the time to do something like
that, but for a well-programmed computer, this kind of tedious work is
easy.

**The Human Element**

So, is there anything a human financial adviser can do that a bot
cannot?

Carl Richards, a financial adviser himself and author of *The Behavior
Gap*, a book about why people do stupid things with money, says a human
might be able to save you from yourself.

"I think a lot of the services that are popping up are doing an amazing
job with all of those things that can fit into an algorithm," Richards
says. "The dilemma I have is what's going to happen when somebody wants
to do something stupid. And the easy example would be ... selling out of
the market when the market goes down.

"To me, it's the one spot where having somebody on the other end of the
phone that knows you — your family, your values, your goals — to walk
you in off that ledge may be irreplaceable," he says.

While Richards says a well-programmed robot would certainly advise its
clients not to sell in a financial panic, he thinks many panicky people
will be sorely tempted to simply turn those machines off in a severe
downturn and sell.

Still, Richards admits that bots offering automated financial management
are already lowering the price for fairly sophisticated financial
advice. And in the process, they're making it more affordable to the
masses.

So who knows? Maybe the time has come to embrace the Robot Age —
although, perhaps it's best [to keep *2001*'s HAL in
mind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEu4Iq5KL-Q) as our money moves
into the digital future.
