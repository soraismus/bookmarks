Promises are the monad of asynchronous programming
==================================================

In my [introduction to monads in
JavaScript](http://blog.jcoglan.com/2011/03/05/translation-from-haskell-to-javascript-of-selected-portions-of-the-best-introduction-to-monads-ive-ever-read/)
we saw a couple of monads and examined the commonality between them to
expose an underlying design pattern. Before I get on to how that applies
to asynchronous programming we need to take one final diversion and
discuss polymorphism.

Consider the list monad that we implemented before:

    var compose = function(f, g) {
      return function(x) { return f(g(x)) };
    };

    // unit :: a -> [a]
    var unit = function(x) { return [x] };

    // bind :: (a -> [a]) -> ([a] -> [a])
    var bind = function(f) {
      return function(list) {
        var output = [];
        for (var i = 0, n = list.length; i < n; i++) {
          output = output.concat(f(list[i]));
        }
        return output;
      };
    };

In our previous example, we just had functions that accepted an
`HTMLElement` and returned a list of `HTMLElement`s. Notice the type
signature of `bind` above: `(a -> [a]) -> ([a] -> [a])`. That ‘`a`‘ just
means we can put any type in its place, but the signature `a -> [a]`
implies that the functions must return a list of things of the same type
as the input. This is actually not the case, and the correct signature
is:

    bind :: (a -> [b]) -> ([a] -> [b])

For example, `bind` may take a function that maps a *single* `String` to
a list of `HTMLElement`s, and return a function that maps a *list of*
`String`s to a list of `HTMLElement`s. Consider these two functions: the
first takes a string and returns a list of nodes with that tag name, and
the second takes a node and returns a list of all the class names it
has.

    // byTagName :: String -> [HTMLElement]
    var byTagName = function(name) {
      var nodes = document.getElementsByTagName(name);
      return Array.prototype.slice.call(nodes);
    };

    // classNames :: HTMLElement -> [String]
    var classNames = function(node) {
      return node.className.split(/\s+/);
    };

If we ignore the ‘returns a list of’ aspect, we’d expect to be able to
compose these to get all the class names of all the links in a document:

    var classNamesByTag = compose(classNames, byTagName);

Of course, we do have lists to contend with, but because the monad just
cares about the lists, not what’s *in* the lists, we can use it to
compose the functions:

    // classNamesByTag :: [String] -> [String]
    var classNamesByTag = compose(bind(classNames), bind(byTagName));

    classNamesByTag(unit('a'))
    // -> ['profile-links', 'signout-button', ...]

The monad just cares about the ‘list of’ part, not the contents of the
list. Just as a reminder, let’s recast this using the pipeline syntax we
developed in the [previous
article](http://blog.jcoglan.com/2011/03/06/monad-syntax-for-javascript/):

    // bind :: [a] -> (a -> [b]) -> [b]
    var bind = function(list, f) {
      var result = [];
      for (var i = 0, n = list.length; i < n; i++) {
        result = result.concat(f(list[i]));
      }
      return result;
    };

    // pipe :: [a] -> [a -> [b]] -> [b]
    var pipe = function(x, functions) {
      for (var i = 0, n = functions.length; i < n; i++) {
        x = bind(x, functions[i]);
      }
      return x;
    };

    // for example
    pipe(unit('a'), [byTagName, classNames])
    // -> ['profile-links', 'signout-button', ...]

The `pipe` function doesn’t actually care that `bind` deals with lists,
and we can write its signature in a more generic way:

    pipe :: m a -> [a -> m b] -> m b

In this notation, `m a` means ‘a monadic wrapper around `a`‘. For
example, if the input is a list of strings, under the `List` monad the
`m` refers to ‘list of’, and `a` refers to ‘string’. This concept of
generic containers becomes extremely important when we consider how we
can apply these ideas to asynchronous programming.

One common complaint levelled against [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) is
that it is easy to become mired in ‘callback hell’, where callbacks
become nested so deeply it’s impossible to maintain the resulting code.
There are various ways to solve this, but I think monads provide an
interesting approach that highlights the need to separate business logic
from code that simply glues data together.

Let’s consider a fairly contrived example: we have a file called
`urls.json`, that contains a JSON document that contains a URL. We want
to read the file, extract this URL, request the URL from the web, and
print the response body. Monads encourage us to think in terms of types
of data, and how they flow through a pipeline. We can model this problem
using our pipeline syntax:

    pipe(unit(__dirname + '/urls.json'),
            [ readFile,
              getUrl,
              httpGet,
              responseBody,
              print         ]);

Beginning with the pathname (a `String`), we can trace the data as it
flows through this pipe:

-   `readFile` takes a `String` (pathname) and returns a `String` (file
    contents)
-   `getUrl` takes a `String` (a JSON document) and returns a `URI`
    object
-   `httpGet` takes a `URI` and returns a `Response`
-   `responseBody` takes a `Response` and returns a `String`
-   `print` takes a `String` and returns nothing

So each link in the chain produces a data type that is consumed by the
next. But in Node, many of these operations are asynchronous. Rather
than use continuation-passing style and deeply nested callbacks, how can
we modify the return types of these functions to indicate the result
might not be known yet? By wrapping them in Promises:

    readFile      :: String   -> Promise String
    getUrl        :: String   -> Promise URI
    httpGet       :: URI      -> Promise Response
    responseBody  :: Response -> Promise String
    print         :: String   -> Promise null

The `Promise` monad needs three things: a wrapper object, a `unit`
function to wrap a value in this object, and a `bind` function to help
us compose the above functions. We can implement promises using the
[Deferrable](http://jsclass.jcoglan.com/deferrable.html) module from
JS.Class:

    var Promise = new JS.Class({
      include: JS.Deferrable,
      
      initialize: function(value) {
        // if value is already known, succeed immediately
        if (value !== undefined) this.succeed(value);
      }
    });

With this class, we can then implement the functions we need to solve
our problem. The functions that can return a value immediately just
return a value wrapped in a `Promise` object:

    // readFile :: String -> Promise String
    var readFile = function(path) {
      var promise = new Promise();
      fs.readFile(path, function(err, content) {
        promise.succeed(content);
      });
      return promise;
    };

    // getUrl :: String -> Promise URI
    var getUrl = function(json) {
      var uri = url.parse(JSON.parse(json).url);
      return new Promise(uri);
    };

    // httpGet :: URI -> Promise Response
    var httpGet = function(uri) {
      var client  = http.createClient(80, uri.hostname),
          request = client.request('GET', uri.pathname, {'Host': uri.hostname}),
          promise = new Promise();
      
      request.addListener('response', function(response) {
        promise.succeed(response);
      });
      request.end();
      return promise;
    };

    // responseBody :: Response -> Promise String
    var responseBody = function(response) {
      var promise = new Promise(),
          body    = '';
      
      response.addListener('data', function(c) { body += c });
      response.addListener('end', function() {
        promise.succeed(body);
      });
      return promise;
    };

    // print :: String -> Promise null
    var print = function(string) {
      return new Promise(sys.puts(string));
    };

So we’ve now got a way to represent a deferred value simply using data
types, no nested callbacks required. The next step is to implement
`unit` and `bind` in such a way that the callback glue is contained
within these functions. `unit` is very simple, it just needs to wrap a
value in a `Promise`. `bind` is more complex: it accepts a `Promise` and
a function. It must extract the value of the `Promise`, give this value
to the function, which returns another `Promise`, then wait for this
final `Promise` to complete.

    // unit :: a -> Promise a
    var unit = function(x) {
      return new Promise(x);
    };

    // bind :: Promise a -> (a -> Promise b) -> Promise b
    var bind = function(input, f) {
      var output = new Promise();
      input.callback(function(x) {
        f(x).callback(function(y) {
          output.succeed(y);
        });
      });
      return output;
    };

With these definitions, you should find that the pipeline shown above
just works, for example if I’ve placed my [GitHub API
URL](http://github.com/api/v2/json/user/show/jcoglan) in the `urls.json`
file:

    pipe(unit(__dirname + '/urls.json'),
            [ readFile,
              getUrl,
              httpGet,
              responseBody,
              print         ]);

    // prints:
    // {"user":{"name":"James Coglan","location":"London, UK", ...

I hope this has shown why Promises (also known as Deferreds in jQuery
and Dojo) are valuable, how they can help you pipe data through your
code, and how this piping glue can be contained in quite a neat way. On
the client side, you’ll find this pattern applies equally well to Ajax
and animation; in fact
[MethodChain](http://jsclass.jcoglan.com/methodchain.html) (which I’ve
been using as async glue for years) is just the Promise monad applied to
method calls instead of function calls.

The full working code for this article is on
[GitHub](https://gist.github.com/865294) if you’d like to tinker with
it. After that, you can dive into [jQuery’s Deferred
API](http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/). There’s also talk
of promises making a return to Node, after they were banished in favour
of continuation-passing style, so you may find you can do this without
writing so much plumbing in future.
