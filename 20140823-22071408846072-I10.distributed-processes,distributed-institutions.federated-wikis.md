Via [@roundtrip](https://twitter.com/roundtrip), this conversation from
July:[![web](http://mikecaulfield.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/web.png?w=590)](https://mikecaulfield.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/web.png)

There’s actually a pretty simple alternative to the current web. In
[federated wiki](http://www.wired.com/2012/07/wiki-inventor/), when you
find a page you like, you curate it to your own server (which may even
be running on your laptop). That forms part of a named-content system,
and if later that page disappears at the source, the system can find
dozens of curated copies across the web. Your curation of a page
guarantees the survival of the page. The named-content scheme guarantees
it will be findable.

It also addresses scalability problems. Instead of linking you to
someone’s page (and helping bring down their server) I curate it. You
see me curate it and read my copy of that page. The page ripples through
the system and the load is automagically dispersed throughout the
system.

It’s interesting that Andreessen can’t see the solution, but perhaps
expected. Towards the end of a presentation I gave Tuesday with Ward
Cunningham about federated content, Ward got into a righteous rant about
the “Tyrrany of Paper”. And the idea he was digging at was this model of
a web page as a printed publication had caused us to ignore the unique
affordances of digital content. We can iteratively publish, for example,
and publish very unfinished sorts of things. We can treat content like
data, and mash it up in new and exciting ways. We can break documents
into smaller bits, and allow multiple paths through them. We can rethink
what authroship looks like.

Or we can take the Andreessen path, which as Ted Nelson said in his
[moving but horribly misunderstood tribute to Doug
Englebart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMjPqr1s-cg), is “the costume
party of fonts that swept aside [Englebart's] ideas of structure and
collaboration.”

The two visions are not compatible, and interestingly it’s Andreessen’s
work which locked us into the later vision. Your web browser requests
one page at a time, and the layout features of MOSAIC\>Netscape
guarantee that you will see that page as the server has determined. The
model is not one of data — eternally fluid, to be manipulated like
[Englebart’s grocery
list](http://hapgood.us/2014/07/15/doug-englebarts-grocery-list/) — but
of the printed page, permanently fixed.

And ultimately this gives us the server-centric version of the web that
we take for granted, like [fish in
water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKYJVV7HuZw). The server
containing the data — Facebook or Blogger, but also WordPress — controls
the presentation of the data, controls what you can do with it. It’s
also the One True Place the page shall live — until it disappears. We’re
left with RSS hacks and a bewildering array of API calls to accomplish
the simplest mashups. And that’s because we know that the author gets to
control the printed page — its fonts, its layout, its delivery, its
location, its future uses.

The Tyrrany of Print led to us gettting pages delivered as Dead Data,
which led to the server-centric vision we now have of the web. The
server-centric vision led to a world that looked less like BitTorrent
and more like Facebook. There’s an easy way out, but I doubt anyone in
Silicon Valley wants to take it.

*Ward Cunningham’s explanation of federation (scheme on right) — one
client can mash together products of many servers. Federation puts the
client, not the server, in control.*

**UPDATE:**

It seems we got front-paged at Hacker News. So for those that don’t
follow the blog I thought I’d add a one minute video to show how
Smallest Federated Wiki uses a combination of JSON, NodeJS, and HTML5 to
accomplish the above model. This vid is just about forking content
between two different servers, really basic. Even neater stuff starts to
happen when you play with connecting pages via names and people via edit
journals, but leave that to another day.

This and more videos and explanations are available at the [SFW
tag](http://hapgood.us/tag/sfw/).

    I’m with you brother Mike, and have done more than my share of
    crying about dead (sometimes deceased sometimes killed) links.

    Yet I wonder about the federations being uneven. Would people in
    this new web just be forking pages all the times as curation?
    conservation? Dp people adopt interest areas? Do we all become
    cottage industry internet archives?

    Or are you saying it becomes part of our flow as much as
    bookmarking, which one could say SFW is as a by product.

    Does that mean federating all the media? That’s one of the fallings
    of the Internet Archive, much as I love it- it is achiving the HTML
    but the media needs to be on the old site (or am I wrong?)

    And its not your solution you provoke, but why do not browsers/web
    server error codes not generate possible links for busted ones back
    to the Internet Archive? Surely a dude that made a web browser knows
    how to build this.

        Archive.org collects all files that can be fetched by a web
        crawler. So (after respecting noindex, nofollow, and disallow
        requests) they save everything that’s linked, including media
        files, and files returned by server-side scripts as the result
        of direct links. But they can’t get the actual server-side
        scripts or databases.

        It just occurred to me that you probably meant streaming media
        coming from another site like YouTube. I think you’re right;
        they don’t save that. Maybe it works if the media link is still
        good, but I’m not even sure about that.

    Forking behavior is a social phenomenon, and therefore
    unpredictable. But at a basic level, we’d expect you’d fork most
    things you to which you linked, one degree out. You’d also curate
    the sort of page that you currently feed to Twitter or Delicious.
    The other stuff you just read.

    Between those behaviors, that’s probably enough to keep the pages
    alive that we need alive.

    The data structure of SFW does a pretty neat thing with images, and
    embeds them in the page as JSON strings. Right now that comfortably
    supports smaller lower quality images that are at least readable (up
    to 15K). The idea is behind that there will eventually be an asset
    pipeline — the small compressed image will always stay with the page
    but will also provide a link to an additional out of page resource.

    Linked YouTube vids and the like are more problematic, but rome
    wan’t buit in a day I guess.

    I agree that in the meantime we should be building some hacks on top
    of the current system, it’s amazing to me how we tolerate the 404s
    as just something normal, which is why Bret Victor’s tweet hit home
    for me. Where else would this system be considered OK?

    […] Over the last couple of days, several items have surfaced in my
    social feeds about how the Internet doesn’t work and what to do
    about that. First came Ethan Zuckerman’s description of advertising
    as “the Internet’s original sin.” which was inspired to some degree
    by Maciek Ceglowski’s The Internet with a Human Face. Today Mike
    Caulfield wrote about link rot and data impermanence. […]

    I hope to start an online community of lifelong learners to trade
    notes and resources, so you can pick and choose the ones you like
    best to expand and refine your own ideas. The federated wiki sounds
    like exactly the kind of tool I’m looking for. So i’m glad I found
    this post. Thank you.

    To answer another question of CogDog’s: Yes, it should be easy for a
    browser to try the WayBack machine when a page is missing. There are
    at least two Chrome extensions that say they do that. Firefox
    plugins might exist, too.

        Thanks for the tips, but those extensions only send you to
        Wayback versions of a page you are looking at (and the reviews
        on one says it only takes you to the home page).

        Extensions/plugins not needed, I have an old school wayback
        bookmarklet that does the job

        javascript:location.href=’http://web.archive.org/web/\*/’+document.location.href;

        easy peasy

            Cool, thanks. For anyone else who hasn’t used bookmarklets,
            you can just “Add” a bookmark, paste the javascript in as a
            URL, and name it anything you want. \*\*\*BUT\*\*\* Replace
            those smart quotes with plain text single quotes, or it
            won’t work. (Took me a while to notice. I thought Chrome was
            being stubborn. No loss, since I found some bookmarklet
            tutorials as I was looking.)

    What is the legal status of such curating? By copying a website and

        Words evolve as they move to new contexts.

        I am pretty sure when you drive your car you are not “urging an
        animal forward, as with oxen”. When you call someone on your
        phone you are not shouting to them to gain attention. And when
        you “browse” the web, you may in fact not be “browsing” in the
        traditional sense at all. Web pages are in fact not pages, feeds
        are not feeds, memes are only examples of a specific type of
        meme. MOOCs are not open. Bookmarks have nothing to do with
        books.

        In the world of the social web, curate has come to mean the
        selection, arrangement, storage, indexing, presentation, and
        redistribution of matter of interest found on the web. It has
        meant that for at least 10 years. That is, in fact, what you do
        with federated wiki. Time to move on, right?

    I would love to see a prototype of a web browser and hyperlink
    scheme based on torrent hashes so that instead of using HTTP you
    could use the BT protocol. That way pages would stick around for
    years even when the original author deletes them. It’s not as far
    fetched as it sounds central seeding servers would make it
    lightening fast.
