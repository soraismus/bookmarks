Preference for masculine or feminine faces linked to urban living
=================================================================

We can't blame this one on our evolutionary past.

Lots of animals choose their mates based on exaggerated features—think
of the enormous antlers of moose or the elaborate plumage of many bird
species. The explanation for this is what's sometimes termed "honest
signaling"—if an animal has the health and metabolic resources to devote
to growing these sorts of sex-specific features, then they've probably
got the genetic wherewithal to produce healthy offspring. As long as
nobody cheats—makes something that just *looks* like it took a lot of
effort—the system works well from an evolutionary perspective.

Do humans engage in honest signaling? Clearly, there are features we
associate with one or the other sex, and researchers have looked in to
whether they might act as signals, feeding in to evolutionary selection.
For example, some research has suggested that feminine faces on females
act as a signal for fertility, as they're associated with estrogen
levels. A masculine appearance, which is linked to testosterone levels,
has been suggested to reflect health and disease resistance. And various
studies have shown that the opposite sex appreciates faces that are
strongly masculine or feminine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Facial symmetry, which many find attractive, isn't linked to better
health.

So, in a neat and tidy package, we have an evolutionary explanation for
both our appearances and our preferences for them. Or so a lot of people
have argued. But a new study in *PNAS* argues that this is all an
artifact of who we're asking. Do some studies in pre-industrial
societies, and you get a very different answer.

The researchers behind the study (it was done by a large, international
collaboration) point out that most of the studies of this sort are done
with populations that are easy for researchers to access—typically,
undergraduates at the same university. And those undergraduates are, in
their terms, WEIRD: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and
Democratic. If you want a picture of our evolutionary past, separate
from modern social influences, then you have to look a bit more broadly
than that.

And so they did, getting student populations from Canada, China, and the
UK. But they also looked at Cree, Tuvans, Fijians, and other groups from
Malaysia, South America, and Africa. These latter societies (excepting
the Cree, who are integrated into the Canadian economy) farm, raise
livestock, or in some cases forage. The status of these social groups
was measured using things like the UN's Human Development Index, its
measure of urbanization, or the World Health Organization's measure of
years of life lost to disease.

The researchers took a set of facial photos from individuals of a number
of ethnic origins, then used a computer to generate two alternate
versions: one with a higher degree of masculinity and one with a higher
degree of femininity. The subjects were asked to choose a photo that
represented someone that might be interested in a long- or short-term
relationship and the one they felt was most aggressive looking.

In general, the preference for a face that more strongly reflects the
features of the opposite sex got stronger when the subjects came from a
country with a high Human Development Index. This was true for both men
and women, although among women the preference for short-term
relationships was essentially random. There were some regional
differences. For example, UK women liked masculine faces for short-term
flings, but neutral faces for longer-term relationships—exactly the sort
of thing that got evolutionary psychologists excited about the honest
signaling model in the first place. But as the society became less
industrialized, things shifted.

What about economic development was associated most strongly with this
change? After running the statistics on multiple factors, urbanization
stood out as the most significant predictor of the results.

There were two other notable results. Populations with higher disease
burdens were less likely to prefer masculine faces—exactly the opposite
result you'd expect if masculinity was signaling high testosterone and
immune health. And the perception that strongly masculine faces were
aggressive was also associated with economic development and
urbanization.

Clearly, since urbanization is a relatively recent development, these
results give us little reason to think that a preference for stronger
signaling by the opposite sex is part of our deep evolutionary past. In
fact, it's doubtful a strong preference could have evolved at all over
the short time that industrial, urbanized societies have existed.
Instead, it's likely that some social factor involved in urbanization is
at play.

And the authors suggest one. The results, they write, "lead us to
speculate (parsimoniously) that the "visual diet" of the observers may
be an important factor in determining trait attributions and
preferences." People in an urban society interact with many, many people
over the course of one day and often have to make snap judgements about
them. By contrast, people in smaller social groups have the time and
capacity to get to know the rest of the group and don't have the need to
rely on secondary cues to make judgements about them.

It's a compelling hypothesis, but for many people, so were the ones
proposed by evolutionary psychologists. The research could be used to
look at a larger group of societies, including some that only urbanized
recently, before we get confident in the trends identified by the
authors.
