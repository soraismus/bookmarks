![fez\_header](http://flippinawesome.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fez_header.jpg)

*By [Isaac Wagner](/authors/isaac-wagner)*

In the world of JavaScript tooling, Grunt is king. Grunt is a task
runner, meaning that a build is defined as a series of tasks which run
one after another. Tasks may include file concatenation, application
deployment, source linting, etc. Grunt isn’t unique as a task runner –
you may have heard of Java’s Ant, or Ruby’s Rake.

Developers have another option besides using a task runner: a file-based
build tool. File-based build tools are extremely common;
[Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is arguably the most well
known and frequently used file-based build tool, but there are many
others. Rather than defining a sequence of tasks to run one after the
other, like a task runner, with a file-based build tool a developer
defines builds as transformational relationships between files. For
example, instead of having a single task that searches a directory and
turns every CoffeeScript file into JavaScript, we define an operation
for each CoffeeScript file which translates it into a new JavaScript
file. This difference may seem inconsequential at first glance, but it
becomes incredibly important when defining how a tool will behave. In
fact, if we take a step back it becomes apparent that Grunt isn’t a
build tool at all. Rather, it simply plays host to build steps, among
any number of other non-build tasks.

Enter Fez. Fez approaches the problem from a different perspective: that
of a build tool, not a task runner. Not only does Fez have a built-in
understanding of what it means to build a project, but it also has an
escape hatch, discussed below, to allow for more traditional “ordered
tasks.” Fez tries to bring together the best of both worlds: the
intelligence of Make and the flexibility of Grunt.

What is Fez?
------------

Fez is a file-based build tool loosely based on
[tup](http://gittup.org/tup/) and written in JavaScript. Fez takes the
idea of a JavaScript build tool with pluggable operations from Grunt,
but goes in a different direction. Builds are defined as sets of rules
with three components: the input(s), the output, and the operation. An
operation is just a function. Unlike Grunt, Fez doesn’t do any magic
plugin loading. You simply `require` the operation function and pass it
as an argument to a rule. Here is why this simple rule-based build
definition system is awesome: Fez is able to glob the file system for an
initial set of inputs, then construct the entire dependency graph from
that set of inputs and the set of rules.

For example, say we had a build spec like this:

    *.less → %f.css
    *.css → %f.min.css
    *.min.css → dist.min.css

This would be written in JavaScript as:

    exports.default = function(spec) {
      spec.with("*.less").each(function(file) {
        //
        spec.rule(file, file.patsubst("%.less", "%.css"), less());
      });

      spec.with("*.css).not("*.min.css").each(function(file) {
        spec.rule(file, file.patsubst("%.css, "%.min.css), cssmin());
      });

      spec.with("*.min.css).all(function(files) {
        spec.rule(files, "dist.min.css", concat());
      });
    };

(The file object’s `patsubst` has the same semantics as make’s
[patsubst](http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/make-3.79.1/html_chapter/make_8.html#SEC77))

And we have a few starting nodes we found on the file system:

[![fez\_ex1](http://flippinawesome.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fez_ex1.gif)](http://flippinawesome.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fez_ex1.gif)

Fez is able to construct the entire graph, from beginning to end:

[![fez\_ex2](http://flippinawesome.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fez_ex2.gif)](http://flippinawesome.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fez_ex2.gif)

Now all we have to do is traverse the graph with a topological sort. We
can introduce parallelization of operations where appropriate by
executing them in child processes and waiting on convergence points.
Fez, like [make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/), compares timestamps
of inputs and outputs during graph traversal, allowing Fez to only do
the work which needs to be done. The build graph even improves cleaning:
any node with one or more inputs is a generated node, and can besafely
removed.

Idempotence
-----------

One of the coolest features of Fez is its inherent idempotence.

> idempotence (uncountable): (mathematics, computing) A quality of an
> action such that repetitions of the action have no further effect on
> outcome – being idempotent.

What this means in the context of Fez is that you can run your build
script as many times as you want, and unless any input files have
changed, no work will be done. As a consequence, there is no reason to
have a file watching system in Fez. You can just (on a Unix system) run
`watch node fez.js`.

Escape Hatch
------------

Sometimes you will want to just escape the whole rule-based system and
do things imperatively. This is simple: `spec.do` defines a node in the
build graph in which you can perform whatever computation, file
manipulation, etc. that you want. It’s usually a good idea to put an
imperative node (or stage, as it’s called in Fez) in its own target and
chain your targets with `spec.use`, but you can certainly put the node
right in the build graph along with every other node (created from rules
or otherwise) using `spec.after(...).do`. Here’s an example:

    exports.default = function (spec) {
      var x = 0;

      // This stage will start alongside the jshint rules. The actual order
      // they will execute is undefined.
      spec.do(function() {
        console.log(x++)
      });

      // Save a handle to the stage.
      var stage = spec.with("*.js").each(function (file) {
        spec.rule(file, jshint());
      });

      // After all operations within the stage are completed,
      // then peform this task.
      spec.after(stage).do(function() {
          console.log(x++);
      });
    };

Examples
--------

For good measure, here are some example builds with animated GIFs
illustrating their graphs:

In this example we illustrate a simple LESS project. The `main.less`
file has an `@import "mobile.less";` statement. This is an example of a
secondary input which is dependent on the file’s contents. The file
`main.less` won’t be read until Fez is sure that no other operations are
going to generate `main.less` (which they aren’t). In some situations
though, a file with secondary inputs may be a generated file, and the
file won’t be read until it has been recreated this time through the
build.

    var fez = require("fez"),
        less = require("fez-less"),
        clean = require("fez-clean-css"),
        concat = require("fez-concat");

    exports.build = function(spec) {
      spec.with("main.less").one(function(file) {
        spec.rule(file, less.imports(file), file.patsubst("%.less", "css/%.css"), less());
      });

      spec.with("dist/*.min.css").all(function(files) {
        spec.rule(files, "dist.min.css", concat());
      });

      spec.with("css/*.css").each(function(file) {
        spec.rule(file, file.patsubst("css/%.css", "dist/%.min.css"), clean());
      });
    };

    exports.default = exports.build;

    fez(module);

[![fez\_ex3](http://flippinawesome.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fez_ex3.gif)](http://flippinawesome.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fez_ex3.gif)

This example illustrates the flexibility of `with(...).all(...)` which
is able to combine any number of source (non-generated) files and
generated files. Like in the previous example, there are many node pairs
which have not one, but two edges between them. The first edge is
created between a stage’s input and any operation nodes within the
stage. The second edge represents the link between a rule’s primary
input and its operation node. The double edges are not computationally
necessary, but are useful to show when visualizing Fez’s behavior.

    var fez = require("fez");

    exports.build = function(spec) {
      spec.with("a").each(function(file) {
        spec.rule(file, "b", function nop1() {});
      });

      spec.with("b").each(function(file) {
        spec.rule(file, "c", function nop2() {});
      });

      spec.with(["a", "b", "c"]).all(function(files) {
        spec.rule(files, "d", function nop3() {});
      });
    };

    exports.default = exports.build;

    fez(module);

Help us out
-----------

The API is still pretty raw. Fez can be used in real projects (and is
being used in a few real projects!), but I am announcing a “request for
feedback.” In true open source fashion, it would be invaluable to have
developers help iron out warts from Fez’s API as early as possible. The
best way is to just use Fez in a project and let us know about your
experiences. Was it simple enough? Did you find it to be an improvement
over your existing build tool? Did you find yourself wishing you never
touched Fez? Tell us why! Join us on the GitHub [issue
tracker](https://github.com/fez/fez/issues), and come hang out in \#fez
on Freenode and share your thoughts!

    There are a number of Javascript build tools. Which is good. I like
    choice. But how does Fez compare to something like Broccoli?

        Or Gulp?\
         One of the things I like about gulp is that they are actively
        checking plugins people are making and providing feedback about
        which ones have been developed “properly” and which one a script
        kiddie threw together and chucked on npm. Are you doing
        something similar ?

    Nah, I’d prefer Gulp.

    there’s a more easier tool called gulp. it’s a taskrunner too and
    it’s more easy than grunt

    People here recommend Gulp, but unlike Fez, Gulp has one major
    problem: as pointed out by
    [http://www.solitr.com/blog/2014/02/broccoli-first-release/](http://www.solitr.com/blog/2014/02/broccoli-first-release/)
    (section 5), Gulp plugins have trouble with files that
    include/import other files — the Sass plugin, for example, abuses
    the Gulp’s piping system and reads the needed files directly from
    the filesystem, breaking the watch() plugin and preventing from any
    form of incremental rebuilding.\
     I like that Fez addresses this issue in a pretty cool way
    (less.imports(file) adds all files imported by file to the tree, if
    I understand it correctly). It just needs a better documentation
    (from official docs: “[...] chain your targets with spec.use (see
    below for an example of this) [...]“, no example below given) and
    more tasks (that’s just matter of popularity and time).\
     Also, it would be pretty cool if someone wrote an adapter of
    existing tasks for Grunt or Gulp to be able to use them in Fez — I
    don’t know if this is really possible, but it would be really
    awesome.

    Sold on the approach, will try Fez at some time.

    Current user of Grunt, works fine for me, but a bit dissatisfied
    with verbosity and lately speed (which can be fixed by introducing
    even more verbosity), so always curious on the alternatives (Gulp
    and Broccoli also look fine, but not convinced).

    It looks very interesting!\
     One questing, how did you make this build-graph processing
    visualisations? Are there any build-in tools for that in fez or may
    be some external tools?

    It would help other readers if you could actually comment on why you
    think one better than the other.

    Or just reframe from commenting and stick with the tool you know.
    Thanks.

        I thought it was pretty clear that a) they are different tools –
        people call Grunt a build tool when it is a task runner; and b)
        the benefit to Fez is that it only reprocesses the files it
        needs to during a build, making the build process more efficient
        and faster.

    Even if it’s possible to run fez every second, I’d prefer a build
    tool that watches my file system and rebuilds a few microseconds
    after I’ve saved a file so that everything is ready when I’ve
    switched from my editor to the browser.
