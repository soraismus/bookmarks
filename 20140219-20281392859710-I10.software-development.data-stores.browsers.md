Web apps have had offline capabilities like saving large data sets and
binary files for some time. You can even do things like [cache MP3
files](https://github.com/mozilla/high-fidelity). Browser technology can
store data offline and plenty of it. The problem, though, is that the
technology choices for how you do this are fragmented.

`localStorage` gets you really basic data storage, but it’s slow and
can’t handle binary blobs. `IndexedDB` and `WebSQL` are asynchronous,
fast, and support large data sets, but their APIs aren’t very
straightforward. Even still, neither `IndexedDB` nor `WebSQL` have
support from all of the major browser vendors and that doesn’t seem like
something that will change in the near future.

If you need to write a web app with offline support and don’t know where
to start, then this is the article for you. If you’ve ever tried to
start working with offline support but it made your head spin, this
article is for you too. Mozilla has made a library called
[localForage](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage) that makes storing
data offline in *any* browser a much easier task.

[around](https://github.com/mozilla/around) is an
[HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/html/html5 "HTML5") Foursquare
client that I wrote that helped me work through some of the pain points
of offline storage. We’re still going to walk through how to use
localForage, but there’s some source for those of you that like learn by
perusing code.

localForage is a JavaScript library that uses the very simple
[localStorage API](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/localstorage/).
`localStorage` gives you, essentially, the features of get, set, remove,
clear, and length, but adds:

-   an asynchronous API with callbacks
-   `IndexedDB`, `WebSQL`, and `localStorage` drivers (managed
    automatically; the best driver is loaded for you)
-   `Blob` and arbitrary type support, so you can store images, files,
    etc.
-   support for ES6 Promises

The inclusion of `IndexedDB` and `WebSQL` support allows you to store
more data for your web app than `localStorage` alone would allow. The
non-blocking nature of their APIs makes your app faster by not hanging
the main thread on get/set calls. Support for
[promises](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/) makes it a
pleasure to write JavaScript without callback soup. Of course, if you’re
a fan of callbacks, localForage supports those too.

Enough talk; show me how it works!
----------------------------------

The traditional `localStorage` API, in many regards, is actually very
nice; it’s simple to use, doesn’t enforce complex data structures, and
requires *zero* boilerplate. If you had a configuration information in
an app you wanted to save, all you need to write is:

~~~~ {.javascript style="font-family:monospace;"}
// Our config values we want to store offline.
var config = {
    fullName: document.getElementById('name').getAttribute('value'),
    userId: document.getElementById('id').getAttribute('value')
};
 
// Let's save it for the next time we load the app.
localStorage.setItem('config', JSON.stringify(config));
 
// The next time we load the app, we can do:
var config = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('config'));
~~~~

Note that we need to save values in `localStorage` as strings, so we
convert to/from JSON when interacting with it.

This appears delightfully straightforward, but you’ll immediately notice
a few issues with `localStorage`:

1.  **It’s synchronous.** We wait until the data has been read from the
    disk and parsed, regardless of how large it might be. This slows
    down our app’s responsiveness. This is especially bad on mobile
    devices; the main thread is halted until the data is fetched, making
    your app seem slow and even unresponsive.

2.  **It only supports strings.** Notice how we had to use `JSON.parse`
    and `JSON.stringify`? That’s because `localStorage` only supports
    values that are JavaScript strings. No numbers, booleans, Blobs,
    etc. This makes storing numbers or arrays annoying, but effectively
    makes storing Blobs impossible (or at least VERY annoying and slow).

A better way with localForage
-----------------------------

localForage gets past both these problems by using asynchronous APIs but
with localStorage’s API. Compare using `IndexedDB` to localForage for
the same bit of data:

### IndexedDB Code

~~~~ {.javascript style="font-family:monospace;"}
// IndexedDB.
var db;
var dbName = "dataspace";
 
var users = [ {id: 1, fullName: 'Matt'}, {id: 2, fullName: 'Bob'} ];
 
var request = indexedDB.open(dbName, 2);
 
request.onerror = function(event) {
    // Handle errors.
};
request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
    db = event.target.result;
 
    var objectStore = db.createObjectStore("users", { keyPath: "id" });
 
    objectStore.createIndex("fullName", "fullName", { unique: false });
 
    objectStore.transaction.oncomplete = function(event) {
        var userObjectStore = db.transaction("users", "readwrite").objectStore("users");
    }
};
 
// Once the database is created, let's add our user to it...
 
var transaction = db.transaction(["users"], "readwrite");
 
// Do something when all the data is added to the database.
transaction.oncomplete = function(event) {
    console.log("All done!");
};
 
transaction.onerror = function(event) {
    // Don't forget to handle errors!
};
 
var objectStore = transaction.objectStore("users");
 
for (var i in users) {
    var request = objectStore.add(users[i]);
    request.onsuccess = function(event) {
        // Contains our user info.
        console.log(event.target.result);
    };
}
~~~~

`WebSQL` wouldn’t be quite as verbose, but it would still require a fair
bit of boilerplate. With localForage, you get to write this:

### localForage Code

~~~~ {.javascript style="font-family:monospace;"}
// Save our users.
var users = [ {id: 1, fullName: 'Matt'}, {id: 2, fullName: 'Bob'} ];
localForage.setItem('users', users, function(result) {
    console.log(result);
});
~~~~

That was a bit less work.

Data other than strings
-----------------------

Let’s say you want to download a user’s profile picture for your app and
cache it for offline use. It’s easy to save binary data with
localForage:

~~~~ {.javascript style="font-family:monospace;"}
// We'll download the user's photo with AJAX.
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
 
// Let's get the first user's photo.
request.open('GET', "/users/1/profile_picture.jpg", true);
request.responseType = 'arraybuffer';
 
// When the AJAX state changes, save the photo locally.
request.addEventListener('readystatechange', function() {
    if (request.readyState === 4) { // readyState DONE
        // We store the binary data as-is; this wouldn't work with localStorage.
        localForage.setItem('user_1_photo', request.response, function() {
            // Photo has been saved, do whatever happens next!
        });
    }
});
 
request.send()
~~~~

Next time we can get the photo out of localForage with just three lines
of code:

~~~~ {.javascript style="font-family:monospace;"}
localForage.getItem('user_1_photo', function(photo) {
    // Create a data URI or something to put the photo in an img tag or similar.
    console.log(photo);
});
~~~~

Callbacks and promises
----------------------

If you don’t like using callbacks in your code, you can use [ES6
Promises](http://www.promisejs.org/) instead of the callback argument in
localForage. Let’s get that photo from the last example, but use
promises instead of a callback:

~~~~ {.javascript style="font-family:monospace;"}
localForage.getItem('user_1_photo').then(function(photo) {
    // Create a data URI or something to put the photo in an <img> tag or similar.
    console.log(photo);
});
~~~~

Admittedly, that’s a bit of a contrived example, but
[around](https://github.com/mozilla/around) has some [real-world
code](https://github.com/mozilla/around/blob/7b23feca9dcd35d71ceb85de3d9492af2fa490f6/www/js/app.coffee#L18)
if you’re interested in seeing the library in everyday usage.

Cross-browser support
---------------------

**localForage supports all modern browsers**. `IndexedDB` is [available
in all modern browsers aside from Safari](http://caniuse.com/indexeddb)
(IE 10+, IE Mobile 10+, Firefox 10+, Firefox for Android 25+, Chrome
23+, Chrome for Android 32+, and Opera 15+). Meanwhile, the stock
Android Browser (2.1+) and Safari use `WebSQL`.

In the worst case, localForage will fall back to localStorage, so you
can at least store basic data offline (though not blobs and much
slower). It at least takes care of automatically converting your data
to/from JSON strings, which is how localStorage needs data to be stored.

if you’d like to see the library do more!

    JavaScript, web components, Node.js, mobile app development, and
    this cool place I hang out a lot called the world wide web. Oh, and
    let's not forget Firefox OS. In my spare time I take singing
    lessons, play Magic: The Gathering, teach people to program, and
    collaborate with scientists for better programmer-scientist
    engagement.
