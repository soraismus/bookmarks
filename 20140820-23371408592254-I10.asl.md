Google Glass gives the deaf an ASL interpreter, even in the dark
================================================================

Deaf students are finally able to enjoy a planetarium, thanks to a Glass app.

A group at Brigham Young University has turned Google Glass into a
device that helps deaf students enjoy a planetarium. The conundrum
facing the deaf in the dark is that they can't see an ASL interpreter,
and captioning is difficult on a round display and would interrupt the
experience for hearing people. To solve this problem, it's wearable
computers to the rescue, as they can allow deaf students to view the
interpreter without disturbing other viewers.

According to
[*EurekAlert*](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-05/byu-gga052714.php),
the project is called "Signglasses," and it gives deaf students a tiny
ASL interpreter while watching the planetarium show. The Glass display
is visible in the dark and displays a video of the interpreter during
the show. The group, which includes two deaf students, hopes to expand
the idea beyond the planetarium. "One idea is when you're reading a book
and come across a word that you don't understand, you point at it, push
a button to take a picture, some software figures out what word you're
pointing at and then sends the word to a dictionary and the dictionary
sends a video definition back," the professor in charge of the group
said. The full results of the group's research will be published in June
at the Interaction Design and Children conference.

/ Sony's Access Glasses in action.

While the idea is a novel use for Glass, it's not the first time a piece
of wearable tech has been used to provide personalized captioning in the
dark. For the last year, Sony and movie theater chain Regal
entertainment have been employing "[Access
Glasses](http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/mkt-digitalcinema/resource.latest.bbsccms-assets-mkt-digicinema-latest-EntertainmentAccessGlasses.shtml)"
to provide deaf customers personalized captions while watching a movie.
Like Glass, Access Glasses are a heads-up display, but this device
covers both eyes for a wider display area. The downside is that they
look much dorkier than Google Glass, but hey, at least you only wear
them in the dark.
