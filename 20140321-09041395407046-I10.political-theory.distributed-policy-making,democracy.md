This article is about a political theory called "pluralism". For the
idea of "pluralism" in politics as acknowledgment of diversity, see
[Pluralism (political
philosophy)](/wiki/Pluralism_(political_philosophy) "Pluralism (political philosophy)").
For other uses, see [Pluralism
(disambiguation)](/wiki/Pluralism_(disambiguation) "Pluralism (disambiguation)").

Classical **pluralism** is the view that politics and decision making
are located mostly in the framework of government, but that many
non-governmental groups use their resources to exert influence. The
central question for classical pluralism is how power and influence is
distributed in a political process. Groups of individuals try to
maximize their interests. Lines of conflict are multiple and shifting as
power is a continuous bargaining process between competing groups. There
may be inequalities but they tend to be distributed and evened out by
the various forms and distributions of resources throughout a
population. Any change under this view will be slow and incremental, as
groups have different interests and may act as "veto groups" to destroy
legislation that they do not agree with.

The existence of diverse and competing interests is the basis for a
[democratic
equilibrium](/w/index.php?title=Democratic_equilibrium&action=edit&redlink=1 "Democratic equilibrium (page does not exist)"),^[[1]](#cite_note-1)^
and is crucial for the obtaining of goals by individuals. A
[polyarchy](/wiki/Polyarchy "Polyarchy") – a situation of open
competition for electoral support within a significant part of the adult
population − ensures competition of group interests and relative
equality. Pluralists stress civil rights, such as freedom of expression
and organization, and an electoral system with at least two parties. On
the other hand, since the participants in this process constitute only a
tiny fraction of the populace, the public acts mainly as bystanders.
This is not necessarily undesirable for two reasons: (1) it may be
representative of a population content with the political happenings, or
(2) political issues require continuous and expert attention, which the
average citizen may not
have.^[*[citation\\ needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]^

Important theorists of pluralism include [Robert A.
Dahl](/wiki/Robert_A._Dahl "Robert A. Dahl") (who wrote the seminal
pluralist work, *[Who Governs?](/wiki/Who_Governs%3F "Who Governs?")*)
and [Seymour Martin
Lipset](/wiki/Seymour_Martin_Lipset "Seymour Martin Lipset").

Pluralist conception of power[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pluralism_(political_theory)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Pluralist conception of power")]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The list of possibilities is virtually endless: legal authority, money,
prestige, skill, knowledge, charisma, legitimacy, free time, and
experience. Pluralists also stress the differences between potential and
actual power as it stands. Actual power means the ability to compel
someone to do something and is the view of power as a causation. Dahl
describes power as a "realistic relationship, such as A's capacity for
acting in such a manner as to control B's responses" [A preface to
Democratic Theory]. Potential power refers to the possibility of turning
resources into actual power. Cash, one of many resources, is only a
stack of bills until it is put to work. [Malcolm
X](/wiki/Malcolm_X "Malcolm X"), for example, was certainly not a rich
person. But by using resources such as his forceful personality,
organizational skills, and especially the legitimacy of his cause, he
had a greater impact on American politics than most wealthy people. A
particular resource like money cannot automatically be equated with
power because the resource can be used skillfully or clumsily, fully or
partially, or not at all.

The pluralist approach to the study of
[power](/wiki/Political_power "Political power"), states that nothing
categorical about power can be assumed in any community. The question
then is not who runs a community, but if any group in fact does. To
determine this, pluralists study specific outcomes. The reason for this
is that they believe human behavior is governed in large part by
[inertia](/wiki/Inertia "Inertia"). That said, actual involvement in
overt activity is a more valid marker of leadership than simply a
reputation. Pluralists also believe that there is no one particular
issue or point in time at which any group must assert itself to stay
true to its own expressed values, but rather that there are a variety of
issues and points at which this is possible. There are also costs
involved in taking action at all − not only losing, but expenditure of
time and effort. While a
[structuralist](/wiki/Structuralism_(sociology) "Structuralism (sociology)")
may argue that power distributions have a rather permanent nature, this
rationale says that power may in fact be tied to issues, which vary
widely in duration. Also, instead of focusing on actors within a
[system](/wiki/System "System"), the emphasis is on the
[leadership](/wiki/Leadership "Leadership") roles itself. By studying
these, it can be determined to what extent there is a power structure
present in a [society](/wiki/Society "Society").

Three of the major tenets of the pluralist school are (1) resources and
hence potential power are widely scattered throughout society; (2) at
least some resources are available to nearly everyone; and (3) at any
time the amount of potential power exceeds the amount of actual power.

Finally, and perhaps most important, no one is all-powerful unless
proven so through empirical observation. An individual or group that is
influential in one realm may be weak in another. Large military
contractors certainly throw their weight around on defense matters, but
how much sway do they have on agricultural or health policies? A measure
of power, therefore, is its scope, or the range of areas where it is
successfully applied as observed by a researcher. Pluralists believe
that with few exceptions power holders usually have a relatively limited
scope of influence. Pluralism does leave room for an elitist situation-
Should a group A continuously exert power over multiple groups. For a
pluralist to accept this notion, it must be empirically observed and not
assumed so by definition.

For all these reasons power cannot be taken for granted. One has to
observe it empirically in order to know who really governs. The best way
to do this, pluralists believe, is to examine a wide range of specific
decisions, noting who took which side and who ultimately won and lost.
Only by keeping score on a variety of controversies can one begin to
identify actual power holders. Pluralism was associated with
[behavioralism](/wiki/Behavioralism "Behavioralism")^[[2]](#cite_note-2)^

A contradiction to pluralist power is often cited from the origin of
one's power. Although certain groups may share power, people within
those groups set agendas, decide issues, and take on leadership roles
through their own qualities. Some theorists argue that these qualities
cannot be transferred, thus creating a system where elitism still
exists. What this theory fails to take into account is the prospect of
overcoming these qualities by garnering support from other groups. By
aggregating power with other organizations, interest groups can
over-power these non-transferable qualities. In this sense, political
pluralism still applies to these aspects.

Elite pluralism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pluralism_(political_theory)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Elite pluralism")]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Elite pluralists agree with classical pluralists that there is
“plurality” of power, however this plurality is not “pure” as some
people and groups have more power than others. For example,some people
have more money than others, so they can pay to have their opinion put
across better (i.e. more advertising) than the working class can. This
inequality is because society has “elites”; people who have more power,
perhaps through money, inheritance or social tradition than
others^[[3]](#cite_note-3)^

Neo-pluralism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pluralism_(political_theory)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Neo-pluralism")]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While Pluralism as a political theory of the state and policy formation
gained its most traction during the 1950s and 1960s in America, some
scholars argued that the theory was too simplistic (see Connolly (1969)
*The Challenge to Pluralist Theory*) - leading to the formulation of
neo-pluralism. Views differed about the division of power in democratic
society. Although neo-pluralism sees multiple pressure groups competing
over political influence, the political agenda is biased towards
corporate power. Neo-pluralism no longer sees the state as an umpire
mediating and adjudicating between the demands of different interest
groups, but as a relatively autonomous actor (with different
departments) that forges and looks after its own (sectional) interests.
Constitutional rules, which in pluralism are embedded in a supportive
political culture, should be seen in the context of a diverse, and not
necessarily supportive, political culture and a system of radically
uneven economic sources. This diverse culture exists because of an
uneven distribution of socioeconomic power. This creates possibilities
for some groups - while limiting others - in their political options. In
the international realm, order is distorted by powerful multinational
interests and dominant states, while in classical pluralism emphasis is
put on stability by a framework of pluralist rules and [free
market](/wiki/Free_market "Free market") society.

There are two significant theoretical critiques on pluralism:
[Corporatism](/wiki/Corporatism "Corporatism") and
[Neo-Marxism](/wiki/Neo-Marxism "Neo-Marxism").

### Charles Lindblom[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pluralism_(political_theory)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Charles Lindblom")]

[Charles E. Lindblom](/wiki/Charles_E._Lindblom "Charles E. Lindblom"),
who is seen as positing a strong neo-pluralist argument, still
attributed primacy to the competition between [interest
groups](/wiki/Interest_group "Interest group") in the policy process but
recognized the disproportionate influence business interests have in the
policy process.

### Corporatism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pluralism_(political_theory)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Corporatism")]

Classical pluralism was criticized as it did not seem to apply to
[Westminster-style](/wiki/Westminster_system "Westminster system")
democracies or the European context. This led to the development of
[corporatist](/wiki/Corporatism "Corporatism") theories. Corporatism is
the idea that a few select interest groups are actually (often formally)
involved in the policy formulation process, to the exclusion of the
myriad other 'interest groups'. For example, [trade
unions](/wiki/Trade_union "Trade union") and major sectoral business
associations are often consulted about (if not the drivers of) specific
policies.

These policies often concern tripartite relations between workers,
employers and the state, with a coordinating role for the latter. The
state constructs a framework in which it can address the political and
economic issues with these organized and centralized groups. In this
view, parliament and party politics lose influence in the policy forming
process.
