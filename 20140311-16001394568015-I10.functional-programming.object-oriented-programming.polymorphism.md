I'm currently enjoying the transition from an object oriented language
to a functional language. It's a breath of fresh air, and I'm finding
myself much more productive than before.

However - there is one aspect of OOP that I've not yet seen a
satisfactory answer for on the FP side, and that is **polymorphism**.
i.e. I have a large collection of data items, which need to be processed
in quite different ways when they are passed into certain functions. For
the sake of argument, let's say that there are multiple factors driving
polymorphic behaviour so potentially exponentially many different
behaviour combinations.

In OOP that can be handled relatively well using polymorphism: either
through composition+inheritance or a prototype-based approach.

In FP I'm a bit stuck between:

-   Writing or composing pure functions that effectively implement
    polymorphic behaviours by branching on the value of each data item -
    feels rather like assembling a huge conditional or even simulating a
    virtual method table!
-   Putting functions inside pure data structures in a prototype-like
    fashion - this seems like it works but doesn't it also violate the
    idea of defining pure functions separately from data?

What are the recommended functional approaches for this kind of
situation? Are there other good alternatives?

If virtual method dispatch is the way you want to approach the problem,
this is a perfectly reasonable approach. As for separating functions
from data, that is a distinctly non-functional notion to begin with. I
consider the fundamental principle of functional programming to be that
functions ARE data. And as for your feeling that you're simulating a
virtual function, I would argue that it's not a simulation at all. It IS
a virtual function table, and that's perfectly OK.

Just because the language doesn't have OOP support built in doesn't mean
it's not reasonable to apply the same design principles - it just means
you'll have to write more of the machinery that other languages provide
built-in, because you're fighting against the natural spirit of the
language you're using. Modern typed functional languages do have very
deep support for polymorphism, but it's a very different approach to
polymorphism.

Polymorphism in OOP is a lot like "existential quantification" in logic
- a polymorphic value has SOME run-time type but you don't know what it
is. In many functional programming languages, polymorphism is more like
"universal quantification" - a polymorphic value can be instantiated to
ANY compatible type its user wants. They're two sides of the exact same
coin (in particular, they swap places depending on whether you're
looking at a function from the "inside" or the "outside"), but it turns
out to be extremely hard when designing a language to "make the coin
fair", especially in the presence of other language features such as
subtyping or higher-kinded polymorphism (polymorphism over polymorphic
types).

If it helps, you may want to think of polymorphism in functional
languages as something very much like "generics" in C\# or Java, because
that's exactly the type of polymorphism that, e.g., ML and Haskell,
favor.

Actually, I should have also mentioned type inference as a complicating
factor for supporting both approaches evenly. It's probably the single
biggest reason functional languages haven't evolved more in that
direction; a language supporting both existential and universal types is
spectacularly hard to infer types for, and we functional programmers
really like our type inference ;). –

thanks... very interesting! As it happens I'm using a Lisp (Clojure) so
compile-time type inference is less of an issue :-) but I'd still like
to maintain a strict functional style –

Well, in Haskell you can always make a type-class to achieve a kind of
polymorphism. Basically, it is defining functions that are processed for
different types. Examples are the classes `Eq` and `Show`:

    data Foo = Bar | Baz

    instance Show Foo where
        show Bar = 'bar'
        show Baz = 'baz'

    main = putStrLn $ show Bar

The function `show :: (Show a) => a -> String` is defined for every data
type that instances the typeclass `Show`. The compiler finds the correct
function for you, depending on the type.

This allows to define functions more generally, for example:

    compare a b = a < b

will work with any type of the typeclass `Ord`. This is not exactly like
OOP, but you even may inherit typeclasses like so:

    class (Show a) => Combinator a where
        combine :: a -> a -> String

It is up to the instance to define the actual function, you only define
the type - similar to virtual functions.

This is not complete, and as far as I know, many FP languages do not
feature type classes. OCaml does not, it pushes that over to its OOP
part. And Scheme does not have any types. But in Haskell it is a
powerful way to achieve a kind of polymorphism, within limits.

To go even further, newer extensions of the 2010 standard allow type
families and suchlike.

Hope this helped you a bit.

thanks - I like the elegance of Haskell as always, but isn't this
effectively defining a conditional branch on the different types of Foo?
How does this scale when Foo becomes extremely complex and/or contains
lots of nested structures? –

Actually, the typeclass functions associated with a type basically get
passed along as a hidden dictionary to the functions that require them,
so `show (Show a) => a -> ()` is actually `show Show -> a -> ()` with
the instance of `Show` provided by the compiler as appropriate for the
type `a`. – [Jeremy W.

@mikera You have to take into accord that Haskell is a lazy language, so
the compiler should be smart enough not to evaluate the nested
structures for just a pattern match. But I'm not 100% sure there.
Generally, with pattern matching you have to trust the compiler to
optimise it for your needs. The GHC does quite a good job there. Keep in
mind that a pattern match is handled differently than a switch or if
branch. – [Lambda Dusk](/users/471436/lambda-dusk "3486 reputation") Feb

Also, I think type classes are rather a matter of the type checker than
of the actual function evaluation, so I don't quite see why the class is
passed to the function? – [Lambda

You should read ["OOP vs
typeclasses"](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/OOP_vs_type_classes).
To understand typeclasses quickly, I recommend reading the HOPL-III
paper ["A History of Haskell: Being Lazy With
Class"](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/history-of-haskell/).

Who said

> defining pure functions separately from data

is best practice?

If you want polymorphic objects, you need objects. In a functional
language, objects can be constructed by glueing together a set of "pure
data" with a set of "pure functions" operating on that data. This works
even without the concept of a class. In this sense, a class is nothing
but a piece of code that constructs objects with the same set of
associated "pure functions".

And polymorphic objects are constructed by replacing some of those
functions of an object by different functions with the same signature.

If you want to learn more about how to implement objects in a functional
language (like Scheme), have a look into this book:

programs"](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

thanks for the perspective... everything you say makes sense but lots of
received wisdom / code examples seem to clearly separate code and
data... e.g. "prefer 1000 functions acting on 1 data structure", MVC
inspired design patterns etc. hmmm maybe I should just ignore recieved
wisdom and go with what works..... –

@mikera: MVC does not separate code from data - it separates different
concerns in your software. That's a different thing, because it acts on
a completely different level of abstraction. – [Doc

Mike, both your approaches are perfectly acceptable, and the pros and
cons of each are discussed, as Doc Brown says, in Chapter 2 of SICP. The
first suffers from having a big type table somewhere, which needs to be
maintained. The second *is* just traditional single-dispatch
polymorphism/virtual function tables.

The reason that scheme doesn't have a built-in system is that using the
wrong object system for the problem leads to all sorts of trouble, so if
you're the language designer, which to choose? Single despatch single
inheritance won't deal well with 'multiple factors driving polymorphic
behaviour so potentially exponentially many different behaviour
combinations.'

To synopsize, there are many ways of constructing objects, and scheme,
the language discussed in SICP, just gives you a basic toolkit from
which you can construct the one you need.

In a real scheme program, you'd build your object system by hand and
then hide the associated boilerplate with macros.

In clojure you actually have a prebuilt object/dispatch system built in
with multimethods, and one of its advantages over the traditional
approach is that it can dispatch on the types of all arguments. You can
(apparently) also use the heirarchy system to give you inheritance-like
features, although I've never used it, so you should take that *cum
grano salis*.

But if you need something different from the object scheme chosen by the
language designer, you can just make one (or several) that suits.

That's effectively what you're proposing above.

Build what you need, get it all working, hide the details with macros.

The argument between FP and OO is not about whether data abstraction is
bad, it's about whether the data abstraction system is the place to
stuff all the separate concerns of the program.

"I believe that a programming language should allow one to define new
data types. I do not believe that a program should consist solely of
definitions of new data types."
