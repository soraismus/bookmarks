Fourier Transforms and Optical Lenses
=====================================

May 27th, 2014

The [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform)
and it’s [closely related](http://bsp.pdx.edu/Reports/BSP-TR0201.pdf)
cousin the discrete time Fourier transform (computed by the FFT) is a
powerful mathematical concept. It breaks an input signal down into it’s
frequency components. The best example is lifted from Wikipedia.

The Fourier transform is used in almost every type of analysis. I’ve
seen the discrete Fourier Transform used to detect vehicles smuggling
contraband across borders and to seperate harmonic overtones from a
cello. It can transform
[convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) into a simple
(and fast!) multiplication and multiply incredibly long polynomials.
These might seem pointless, but they’re useful with any
“[nice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTI_system_theory)” system and
complicated stability problems, respectively. The Fourier transform is
perhaps the most useful abstract athematical concept.

We can see that it’s very abstract and mathematical just by looking at
it’s definition: $\\newcommand{\\fourier}[1]{\\mathbb{F}\\left[ \#1
\\right]} $

The Fourier transform is so useful, the discrete version is implemented
in probably every programming language through `fft` and there are even
dedicated chips to perform this efficiently. The last thing we would
expect is for this abstract and mathematical concept to be implemented
by physical devices.

We could easily have some integrated chip call `fft`, but that’s not
interesting. If a physical device that has some completely unrelated
purpose but can still perform an Fourier transform without human
intervention (read: programming), that’d be interesting. For example, an
optical lens is shaped solely to produce an image, not to take a Fourier
transform… but that’s exactly what it does.

Let me repeat: a *lens can take an exact spatial Fourier transform.*
This does have some limitations^[1](#fn:1)^, mainly that it only works
under coherent light. A coherent light source is simply defined a source
that’s not random. Natural light is random as there are many different
wavelengths coming in at random times. Laser light is very coherent –
there’s a very precise wavelength and every individual ray is in
phase^[2](#fn:3)^.

[Goodman](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Fourier-Optics-Joseph-Goodman/dp/0974707724),
the textbook that almost every Fourier optics course uses,
says^[3](#fn:2)^ that the field for a lens of focal length $f$ is

When $d=f$, *that’s exactly the definition of a Fourier transform.*
Meaning we can expect $U\_f(u,v) \\propto
\\fourier{U\_i(x,y)}\\big|\_{f\_x = u/\\lambda f} $. Minus some physical
scaling, that’s an *exact* Fourier transform.

You may know that a purely real values input to a Fourier transform
gives a complex output. We have no way of detecting this complexity or
phase. Instead, our eyes (and cameras/etc) detect *intensity* or the
*magnitude* of $U\_f(x,y)$. That is, they detect $I\_f(x,y) =
\\left|U\_f(x,y)\\right| \^2$. This function is purely real, although
there’s some [fancy
ways](http://www.opticsinfobase.org/ao/fulltext.cfm?uri=ao-23-6-812&id=27347)^[4](#fn:6)^
to detect phase as well.

No matter how elegant this math was, I wanted to see it in the real
world and compare the computer FFT with the lens Fourier transform. The
setup for this experiment was rather involved, and I would like to give
a resounding thanks to Mint Kunkel. Without his help, I *never* could
have gotten an image, much less a decent one.

I was taking an image of a grid, illuminated by a infinite^[5](#fn:4)^
plane wave generated by a laser. The computer generated image and
discrete Fourier Transform are shown below.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottsievert/scottsievert.github.io/master/src/source/_posts/lens_fft_images/lens-fft-computer/grid.png)

We can’t expect the lens Fourier transform to look exactly like this.
The first issue that jumps to mind is discrete vs continuous time, but
that should hopefully play a small role. The equipment required to get
this image is highly specialized and costs more than I want to know. But
even more significantly, the tuning of this equipment is critical and
almost impossible to get right. Plus, there’s detail like grid
spacing/size/etc missing, the reason the two images aren’t almost
exactly identical.

Regardless, the Fourier transform by lens shows remarkable similarity to
the Fourier transform done on the computer.

This is a real world example of how a lens, a simple object used for
photography performs perhaps the most powerful concept in signal
processing. This alone is cool, but it shows itself elsewhere. The
transfer function is just the pupil function or

($c$ is a constant, only works under coherent light, but has similar
effect in incoherent light). If you want to resolve a higher frequency
(aka more detail), you need your pupil function to extend further.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottsievert/scottsievert.github.io/master/src/source/_posts/lens_fft_images/pupil/stack.png)

Animals have different shaped *pupils* or different *pupil functions*
for their eye. A cat has a very vertical pupil, a zebra’s pupil is
horizontal and an eagle’s pupil is round^[6](#fn:5)^. There are
different evolutionary reasons why an animal needs to see more detail in
the vertical or horizontal directions (ie, jumping vs hunting) and this
shows itself with their pupils. Animals see more detail in the
horizontal or vertical directions if that’s what they care about!

1.  Another limitation: the lens can only accept frequencies as large as
    $r/\\lambda f$, meaning the input signal must be
    band-limited.[↩](#fnref:1)

2.  For a detailed explanation of why the laser spots are speckled and
    random, see my [previous blog
    post](http://scottsievert.github.io/blog/2014/05/18/speckle-and-lasers/).[↩](#fnref:3)

3.  The derivation culminates on page 105. This assumes the [paraxial
    approximation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraxial_approximation)
    is valid.[↩](#fnref:2)

4.  Horner, J. L., & Gianino, P. D. (1984). [Phase-only matched

    23(6), 812-816.[↩](#fnref:6)

5.  Three centimeters is about infinity according to Mint.[↩](#fnref:4)

6.  Images are taken from Google Images. If you are the owner of one of
    these images and would like it removed, let me know and I’ll remove
    it.[↩](#fnref:5)
