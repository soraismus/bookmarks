You’d Be Surprised By What Really Motivates Users

Habit-Forming Products](http://www.hookmodel.com), a book I wrote with
[Ryan Hoover](http://ryanhoover.me) and originally appeared on
TechCrunch.\
*

Earlier this month, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone unveiled his mysterious
startup [Jelly](http://jelly.co). The question-and-answer app was met
with a mix of [criticism](http://readwrite.com/2014/01/09/jelly-goodbye)
and [head scratching](https://medium.com/p/d3d11c067984). Tech-watchers
asked if the world really needed another Q&A service. Skeptics
questioned how it would compete with existing solutions and pointed to
the rocky history of previous products like Mahalo Answers, Formspring,
and Aardvark.

In an interview, Biz articulated his goal to, “make the world a more
empathetic place.” Sounds great but one wonders if Biz is being overly
optimistic. Aren’t we all busy enough? Control for our attention is in a
constant tug-of-war as we struggle to keep-up with all the demands for
our time. Can Jelly realistically help people help one another? For that
matter, how does any technology stand a chance of motivating users to do
things outside their normal routines?

We hope a few insights gleaned from user psychology may help the Jelly
makers improve their jam and provide some tips for anyone building an
online community.

### Lesson 1 – The Right Reward

In May 2007, entrepreneur and Internet celebrity Jason Calacanis
launched a site called Mahalo. A flagship feature of the new site was a
Q&A forum known as Mahalo Answers. Unlike previous Q&A sites, Mahalo
utilized a special incentive to get users to ask and answer questions.

![image](https://draftin.com:443/images/8171?token=FGNXDrk8F2ehg8p1W1GcadTOfkHLLBdoIRRRXPs0J0TixH3DJwXQhcZozuHlvJHX_XljzkHsSlAJ9mNJIZsNh04)

People who submitted a question would offer a bounty in the form of a
virtual currency known as “Mahalo Dollars.” Then, other users would
contribute answers to the question and the best response would receive
the bounty, which could be exchanged for real money. By providing a
monetary reward, the Mahalo founders believed they could drive user
engagement and form new habits.

At first, Mahalo garnered significant attention and traffic. At its high
point, [14.1 million
users](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_Calacanis&oldid=579577057)
worldwide visited the site monthly. But over time, usage stalled.

[Calacanis blamed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JpKgAmFFho) Google’s
algorithm update for having a major negative impact but said Mahalo was,
“growing very slowly” even before the change. As Mahalo struggled to
retain users, another Q&A site began to boom. Quora, launched in 2010 by
two former Facebook employees, quickly grew in popularity. Unlike
Mahalo, Quora did not offer a single cent to anyone answering questions.
Why then, have users stayed engaged with Quora but not with Mahalo,
despite its monetary rewards?

In Mahalo’s case, executives assumed that paying users would drive
repeat engagement with the site. After all, people like money, right?

However, Quora demonstrated that social rewards and the [variable
reinforcement](http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/03/want-to-hook-your-users-drive-them-crazy.html)
of recognition from peers proved to be a much more salient motivator.
Quora instituted an upvoting system that reports user satisfaction with
answers and provides a steady stream of social feedback. Quora’s rewards
have proven more attractive than Mahalo’s because the incentive to
answer a question is driven by the anticipation of social, not
financial, reward. When it comes to online communities, the need to
connect and contribute turns out to be a more powerful motivator than
collecting cash.

### Lesson 2 – Frequency Matters

Think of the products and services you would identify as
“habit-forming.” Odds are most of these services are used daily, if not
multiple times per day. For instance, in December of 2013, a remarkable
[61.5 percent of Facebook’s 1.23 billion monthly active
users](http://newsroom.fb.com/Key-Facts) returned to the site at least
once per day. A [survey conducted by
IDC](https://fb-public.app.box.com/s/3iq5x6uwnqtq7ki4q8wk) revealed
Americans checked Facebook an average of 14 times per day.

When it comes to forming habits, frequency matters and studies have
demonstrated that [how often a behavior occurs is a key
factor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22989272) in the likelihood
of creating a new routine.

On Mahalo, only one person was awarded the monetary bounty, often days
after submitting their answer. If payouts were meant to take the form of
a game, then the rewards came too infrequently to matter. The same can
be said for those asking questions. Relative to the results delivered by
Google, Mahalo Answers took an eternity. Services that can deliver quick
rewards encourage higher frequency of use and have an easier time
forming new habits.

Though still not as fast as a Google search, Jelly provides feedback
relatively quickly. It is not surprising given his Twitter pedigree that
Biz Stone understands the power of frequent interactions. On Twitter,
the feedback is fast and often furious — a single tweet can generate
favorites, retweets, and replies within seconds. For Jelly to succeed,
users must receive frequent reinforcement.

Within 60 seconds of submitting the question, “Why do you use Jelly?”
four people responded, pulling me back to the app before my grip left my
iPhone. When asking a question on Jelly, friends and friends-of-friends
receive a push notification, prompting the recipients to help.

Unfortunately, to get the notifications, users need to have the app. As
one would expect of a fledgling service, Jelly has not yet reached the
critical mass of people needed to provide the quick Twitter-like
feedback users crave. For the reward to come fast enough, not only does
Jelly need enough users, but it must also build the right kind of
community.

### Lesson 3 – A Community of People Whose Opinions We Care About

We are a species that depends on each other. Social rewards are driven
by our connectedness with other people. Our brains are adapted to seek
rewards that make us feel accepted, attractive, important, and included.
Many of our institutions and industries are built around this need for
social reinforcement. From civic and religious groups to spectator
sports and “water cooler” television shows, the need to feel social
connectedness informs our values and drives much of how we spend our
time.

Sites that leverage these kinds of rewards benefit from what
psychologist [Albert
Bandura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Bandura) called “social
learning theory.” Bandura studied the power of modeling and ascribed
special powers to our ability to learn from others. In particular,
Bandura showed that people who observe someone being rewarded for a
particular behavior are more likely to alter their own beliefs and
subsequent actions.

However, social rewards are not as meaningful if they come from just
anyone. Notably, Bandura showed that when people observe the behavior of
people most like themselves, or those who are slightly more experienced,
social learning worked particularly well. This is exactly the kind of
targeted demographic and interest-level segmentation that
industry-specific sites such as Stack Overflow apply.

[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), the world’s largest Q&A
site for software developers, generates a staggering 5,000 answers to
member questions daily. Many of these responses provide detailed, highly
technical and time-consuming answers. Users invest effort into what
others may see as the burdensome task of writing technical
documentation.

Like Quora users, Stack Overflow users are not rewarded with money, but
recognition within the community. Each time a user submits an answer,
other members have the opportunity to vote the response up or down. The
best responses percolate upwards, accumulating points for their authors.
When they reach certain point levels, members earn badges, which endow
special status and privileges.

![image](https://draftin.com:443/images/8170?token=QnCUMMhMQuzbnLyOiBKv9JcTPeEVpoj8_AQohzaDaXbgJvT2o2R6WOKBH2kApfGjug-qDgDDSsdjhBcUfX4ABL8)

Stack Overflow works because, like all of us, software engineers find
satisfaction in contributing to a community they care about; turning a
seemingly mundane task into an engaging, game-like experience. But on
Stack Overflow, points are not just an empty game mechanic, they confer
special value by representing how much someone has contributed to their
tribe. Users enjoy the feeling of helping their fellow programmers and
earning the respect of people whose opinions they value.

### Jelly: Sweet or Sour?

Will Jelly succeed where other Q&A services failed? It is always hard to
predict the success or failure of new still evolving products. We hope
Jelly and other community-oriented sites will take lessons from the
examples above to provide frequent, meaningful rewards from a community
that users care about. By looking to insights from psychology, product
designers can increases their odds of forming new user habits.

    Spot on. Isn’t there a study that also shows if there is a natural
    reward (social recognition) and you try to layer on an additional
    one (cash incentive), then people will actual do desired action less
    with two reasons than one?

        I haven’t seen one but would love see the results if you come

            I don’t have access. But this sounds familiar to what I am
            thinking about. Maybe picked it up from a Dan A podcast.

    I really like the frequency point you made. That may very well be
    the toughest nut to crack as I think about how to hook people with a
    product.

    -   http://www.nirandfar.com/ Nir Eyal

        I agree, frequency of engagement is very contextually specific
        to the product and hard to change.
