After we understand the type of [machine learning
problem](http://machinelearningmastery.com/practical-machine-learning-problems-real-world-examples-and-discover-how-to-identify-common-classes-of-machine-learning-problems/ "Practical Machine Learning Problems: Real-world Examples and Discover How to Identify Common Classes of Machine Learning Problems")
we are working with, we can think about the type of data to collect and
the types of machine learning algorithms we can try. In this post we
take a tour of the most popular machine learning algorithms. It is
useful to tour the main algorithms to get a general idea of what methods
are available.

There are so many algorithms available. The difficulty is that there are
classes of method and there are extensions to methods and it quickly
becomes very difficult to determine what constitutes a canonical
algorithm. In this post I want to give you two ways to think about and
categorize the algorithms you may come across in the field.

The first is a grouping of algorithms by the learning style. The second
is a grouping of algorithms by similarity in form or function (like
grouping similar animals together). Both approaches are useful.

Learning Style
--------------

There are different ways an algorithm can model a problem based on its
interaction with the experience or environment or whatever we want to
call the input data. It is popular in machine learning and artificial
intelligence text books to first consider the learning styles that an
algorithm can adopt.

There are only a few main learning styles or learning models that an
algorithm can have and we’ll go through them here with a few examples of
algorithms and problem types that they suit. This taxonomy or way of
organizing machine learning algorithms is useful because it forces you
to think about the the roles of the input data and the model preparation
process and select one that is the most appropriate for your problem in
order to get the best result.

-   **Supervised Learning**: Input data is called training data and has
    a known label or result such as spam/not-spam or a stock price at a
    time. A model is prepared through a training process where it is
    required to make predictions and is corrected when those predictions
    are wrong. The training process continues until the model achieves a
    desired level of accuracy on the training data. Example problems are
    classification and regression. Example algorithms are Logistic
    Regression and the Back Propagation Neural Network.
-   **Unsupervised Learning**: Input data is not labelled and does not
    have a known result. A model is prepared by deducing structures
    present in the input data. Example problems are association rule
    learning and clustering. Example algorithms are the Apriori
    algorithm and k-means.
-   **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Input data is a mixture of labelled
    and unlabelled examples. There is a desired prediction problem but
    the model must learn the structures to organize the data as well as
    make predictions. Example problems are classification and
    regression. Example algorithms are extensions to other flexible
    methods that make assumptions about how to model the unlabelled
    data.
-   **Reinforcement Learning**: Input data is provided as stimulus to a
    model from an environment to which the model must respond and react.
    Feedback is provided not from of a teaching process as in supervised
    learning, but as punishments and rewards in the environment. Example
    problems are systems and robot control. Example algorithms are
    Q-learning and Temporal difference learning.

When crunching data to model business decisions, you are most typically
using supervised and unsupervised learning methods. A hot topic at the
moment is semi-supervised learning methods in areas such as image
classification where there are large datasets with very few labelled
examples. Reinforcement learning is more likely to turn up in robotic
control and other control systems development.

Algorithm Similarity
--------------------

Algorithms are universally presented in groups by similarity in terms of
function or form. For example, tree based methods, and neural network
inspired methods. This is a useful grouping method, but it is not
perfect. There are still algorithms that could just as easily fit into
multiple categories like Learning Vector Quantization that is both a
neural network inspired method and an instance-based method. There are
also categories that have the same name that describes the problem and
the class of algorithm such as Regression and Clustering. As such, you
will see variations on the way algorithms are grouped depending on the
source you check. Like machine learning algorithms themselves, there is
no perfect model, just a good enough model.

In this section I list many of the popular machine leaning algorithms
grouped the way I think is the most intuitive. It is not exhaustive in
either the groups or the algorithms, but I think it is representative
and will be useful to you to get an idea of the lay of the land. If you
know of an algorithm or a group of algorithms not listed, put it in the
comments and share it with us. Let’s dive in.

### Regression

Regression is concerned with modelling the relationship between
variables that is iteratively refined using a measure of error in the
predictions made by the model. Regression methods are a work horse of
statistics and have been cooped into statistical machine learning. This
may be confusing because we can use regression to refer to the class of
problem and the class of algorithm. Really, regression is a process.
Some example algorithms are:

-   Ordinary Least Squares
-   Logistic Regression
-   Stepwise Regression
-   Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
-   Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS)

### Instance-based Methods

Instance based learning model a decision problem with instances or
examples of training data that are deemed important or required to the
model. Such methods typically build up a database of example data and
compare new data to the database using a similarity measure in order to
find the best match and make a prediction. For this reason,
instance-based methods are also called winner-take all methods and
memory-based learning. Focus is put on representation of the stored
instances and similarity measures used between instances.

-   k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN)
-   Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)
-   Self-Organizing Map (SOM)

### Regularization Methods

An extension made to another method (typically regression methods) that
penalizes models based on their complexity, favoring simpler models that
are also better at generalizing. I have listed Regularization methods
here because they are popular, powerful and generally simple
modifications made to other methods.

-   Ridge Regression
-   Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)
-   Elastic Net

### Decision Tree Learning

Decision tree methods construct a model of decisions made based on
actual values of attributes in the data. Decisions fork in tree
structures until a prediction decision is made for a given record.
Decision trees are trained on data for classification and regression
problems.

-   Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
-   Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3)
-   C4.5
-   Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)
-   Decision Stump
-   Random Forest
-   Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
-   Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

### Bayesian

Bayesian methods are those that are explicitly apply Bayes’ Theorem for
problems such as classification and regression.

-   Naive Bayes
-   Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE)
-   Bayesian Belief Network (BBN)

### Kernel Methods

Kernel Methods are best known for the popular method Support Vector
Machines which is really a constellation of methods in and of itself.
Kernel Methods are concerned with mapping input data into a higher
dimensional vector space where some classification or regression
problems are easier to model.

-   Support Vector Machines (SVM)
-   Radial Basis Function (RBF)
-   Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA)

### Clustering Methods

Clustering, like regression describes the class of problem and the class
of methods. Clustering methods are typically organized by the modelling
approaches such as centroid-based and hierarchal. All methods are
concerned with using the inherent structures in the data to best
organize the data into groups of maximum commonality.

-   k-Means
-   Expectation Maximisation (EM)

### Association Rule Learning

Association rule learning are methods that extract rules that best
explain observed relationships between variables in data. These rules
can discover important and commercially useful associations in large
multidimensional datasets that can be exploited by an organisation.

-   Apriori algorithm
-   Eclat algorithm

### Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial Neural Networks are models that are inspired by the structure
and/or function of biological neural networks. They are a class of
pattern matching that are commonly used for regression and
classification problems but are really an enormous subfield comprised of
hundreds of algorithms and variations for all manner of problem types.
Some of the classically popular methods include (I have separated Deep
Learning from this category):

-   Perceptron
-   Back-Propagation
-   Hopfield Network
-   Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
-   Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)

### Deep Learning

Deep Learning methods are a modern update to Artificial Neural Networks
that exploit abundant cheap computation. The are concerned with building
much larger and more complex neural networks, and as commented above,
many methods are concerned with semi-supervised learning problems where
large datasets contain very little labelled data.

-   Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
-   Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
-   Convolutional Network
-   Stacked Auto-encoders

### Dimensionality Reduction

Like clustering methods, Dimensionality Reduction seek and exploit the
inherent structure in the data, but in this case in an unsupervised
manner or order to summarise or describe data using less information.
This can be useful to visualize dimensional data or to simplify data
which can then be used in a supervized learning method.

-   Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
-   Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS)
-   Sammon Mapping
-   Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
-   Projection Pursuit

### Ensemble Methods

Ensemble methods are models composed of multiple weaker models that are
independently trained and whose predictions are combined in some way to
make the overall prediction. Much effort is put into what types of weak
learners to combine and the ways in which to combine them. This is a
very powerful class of techniques and as such is very popular.

-   Boosting
-   Bootstrapped Aggregation (Bagging)
-   AdaBoost
-   Stacked Generalization (blending)
-   Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
-   Random Forest

Resources
---------

This tour of machine learning algorithms was intended to give you an
overview of what is out there and some tools to relate algorithms that
you may come across to each other.

The resources for this post are as you would expect, other great lists
of machine learning algorithms. Try not to feel overwhelmed. It is
useful to know about many algorithms, but it is also useful to be
effective and have a deep knowledge of just a few key methods.

-   [List of Machine Learning
    Algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_machine_learning_algorithms):
    On Wikipedia. Although extensive, I do not find this list or the
    organization of the algorithms particularly useful.
-   [Machine Learning Algorithms
    Category](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Machine_learning_algorithms):
    Also on Wikipedia, a slightly more useful than Wikipedias great list
    above. It organizes algorithms alphabetically.
-   [CRAN Task View: Machine Learning & Statistical
    Learning](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html):
    A list of all the packages and all the algorithms supported by each
    machine learning package in R. Gives you a grounded feeling of
    what’s out there and what people are using for analysis day-to-day.
-   [Top 10 Algorithms in Data
    Mining](http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~icdm/algorithms/index.shtml):
    [Published
    article](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-007-0114-2)
    and now a
    [book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1420089641?tag=inspiredalgor-20)
    (Affiliate Link) on the most popular algorithms for data mining.
    Another grounded and less overwheling take on methods that you could
    go off and learn deeply.

I hope you have found this tour useful. Leave a comment if you know of a
better way to think about organizing algorithms or if you know of any
other great lists of machine learning algorithms.

        Hi qnaguru, I’d recommend starting small and experimenting with
        algorithms on small datasets using a tool like Weka. It’s a GUI
        tool and provides a bunch of standard datasets and algorithms
        out of the box.

        I’d suggest you build up some skill on small datasets before
        moving onto big data tools like Hadoop and Mahout.

    The best written one I have found is: “The Elements of Statistical
    Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition”.
    However you probably need to have some background on
    maths/stats/computing before reading that (especially if you are
    planning to implement them too). For general algorithms
    implementation I recommend reading also “Numerical Recipes 3rd
    Edition: The Art of Scientific Computing”.

        It’s a good point. Computers are fast enough that you can
        enumerate the search space faster than a GA can converge (at
        least with the classical toy problems).

            I enjoyed this post but I think that this is a misinformed
            statement. Genetic Algorithms are most useful in large
            search spaces (enumerating here would be impossible, were
            talking about spaces that could be 10\^100) and highly
            complex non-convex functions. Modern algorithms are much
            more sophisticated than the simple techniques used in the
            80s e.g.
            ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES))
            and
            ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation\_of\_distribution\_algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_of_distribution_algorithm)).

    Hi guys, this is great! What about recommendation systems? I’m

        Good point.\
         You can break a recommender down into a classification ore
        regression problem.

    Where does imagination lie? Would it be a Unsupervised Feedback
    Learning? Maybe its Neural Deep Essemble Networks. I presume
    dreaming = imagination while sleeping, hence daydreaming is
    imagining of new learning algorithms

    I lot of people swear by this chart for helping you narrow down
    which machine learning approach to take:
    [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/\_static/ml\_map.png](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/_static/ml_map.png).
    It doesn’t seem to cover all the types you list in your article.
    Perhaps a more thorough chart would be useful.

    Thid is great. I had always been looking for “all types” of ML
    algorithms available. I enjoyed reading this and look forward to
    further reading
