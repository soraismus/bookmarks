I'm currently installing NetBeans, and the default install directory is
`/home/thomasowens/netbeans-6.8`. I'm not a fan of that location, so I'm
looking at `/etc`, `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, and `/sbin`. Does Linux have a
place that, by convention, is the same as Windows' `C:\Program Files`
directory?

According to the [Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html), there are
several places that are acceptable, depending on the application. I'm
quoting from it extensively here.

-   `bin` is short for "binary" of course
-   `sbin` is short for "server binary", otherwise defined as:

    > Utilities used for system administration (and other root-only
    > commands)

-   `/usr` is for shareable, read-only data, and should be shareable
    between various FHS-compliant hosts (if you have lots of machines on
    your network, and they're all the same architecture, you should be
    able to share a single /usr folder with every machine on the
    network)

-   `/usr/local` is for use by the system administrator when installing
    software locally (ie, for applications installed only on this
    machine, not on every machine on the network).

* * * * *

Taking these together:

-   `/usr/bin` is the primary directory of executable commands on the
    system.
-   `/usr/sbin` is for any non-essential binaries used exclusively by
    the system administrator.
-   System administration programs that are required for system repair,
    system recovery, mounting /usr, or other essential functions must be
    placed in `/sbin` instead (ie, the things you need to access in
    order to mount `/usr/sbin` go in `/sbin`)
-   Likewise, essential user commands that may be needed before `/usr`
    is mounted go in `/bin`
-   Anything installed only on the local machine should go in
    `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/local/sbin`

* * * * *

There's one other use for /usr/local though. Most things that you
install through your distro's package manager will be placed under /usr;
many people put things they've compiled by hand under /usr/local
instead. This keeps them out of the way of the package management system
and lets you spot what you installed from the distro (and don't need to
back up because you can grab it again) and what you compiled by hand; it
also lets you run different versions at the same time (eg,
/usr/bin/firefox vs /usr/local/bin/firefox).

* * * * *

Just when you thought things were settled, there's one other place,
which is probably the closest equivalent of `c:\Program Files` - `/opt`:

> `/opt` is reserved for the installation of add-on application software
> packages.\`

`/opt` is probably the closest equivalent to `c:\program files`, in that
it's the one place you'd expect to find an application with all its
files together in one folder, rather than scattered across `/usr/bin`,
`/var`, and `/etc`. It's usually only used by very large packages, but
in this case, given that Netbeans wants to have its own folder, it
probably makes the most sense to put it under /opt/netbeans

interesting. if I had designed Linux I would have put the network shared
apps in /usr/shared and then put the privately local host apps in /usr .
that way i could share /usr/shared without also , through inheritance,
sharing /usr . – [djangofan](/users/9571/djangofan "963 reputation") Jan

Really it comes down to personal preference. I'll explain mine for what
its worth.

/usr, /usr/bin are usually places for software installed by the system
to be installed. When I install things myself, I intall in one of
several places:

1.  If it's a script or small program only I will use, I install it in
    \~/bin - this is where most of my stuff ends up.
2.  If it's something like you described (netbeans) with a full file
    tree of its own, I install it in /opt
3.  It's its a single executable, I install it in /usr/local/bin

Why do I distinguish between \#2 & \#3? No idea, it's just a habit that
I've developed over time. It does work out that that /opt usually ends
up becoming a deep tree of files, but has only 2 or 3 actual 'things'
installed. At this momnet I have lampp and lotus notes installed in opt,
2 directories that each have rather large trees beneath them. In
/usr/local/bin I have 20 or 30 entries, but no subdirectory.

I don't install things in /usr/bin or /usr/sbin because I like to keep
things that I add manually (not part of simply installing from the
standard repository) separate.

I would have thought that the default location is `/bin`, it is where
pretty much everything gets installed by default if using apt-get or
similar...

... However, when it comes to more modern programs (or ones without an
installer) that have a lot of additional files, I like to place them in
their own directory within `/bin`.

What is the difference between /bin, /usr/bin, and /sbin? /bin makes the
most sense, since it's for BINary files. – [Thomas

Usually they install in multiple folders, mainly /usr, /local, /bin,
etc. You can find out where the program installs to from the GDebi
Installer (under the files tab). If you're going to move Netbeans, I'd
suggest moving it to /opt, because that's where Google seems to install
its stuff.

While the [Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html) does provide
some guidance. I've found that most distributions like to install
packages into `/usr/share`.

Because of this, I've adopted the practice of installing any application
not installed via package manager (rpm / apt-get / emerge) in
`/usr/local`. This allows me to keep applications and libraries that
aren't managed via package management separate from those that are.

It's a technique that has helped me manage my system under both Fedora
Core and Gentoo.

Agreeing with James Polley's answer, but in fact the default directory
makes a lot of sense unless you need to share the application between
multiple accounts. I, for instance, needed to install Eclipse 3.0
(obsolete) in order to do Flex work under Linux, and I put it in
$HOME/eclipse3.
